         <title>In&#8208;situ Generated Iridium Nanoparticles as Hydride Donors in Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions with Deuterium and Tritium Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with deuterium or tritium gas as isotope sources and in&#8208;situ formed transition metal nanoparticles as hydrogen atom transfer pre&#8208;catalysts. By this means we have found synergistic reactivities applying two different HIE mechanisms, namely photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization HIE leading to the synthesis of highly deuterated complex molecules. Finally, we adopted these findings successfully to tritium chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Gallium Triggers Ferroptosis through a Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium ion (Ga3+) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non&#8208;apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (Ga&#8208;1); we found that Ga&#8208;1 acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, Ga&#8208;1 also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of Ga&#8208;1 and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic effect both in vitro and in vivo.&#160;This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti&#8208;neoplastic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxy&#8208;rich Fe Single Atom Sites Boost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for the energy conversion and storage devices. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are&#160;the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88 V), Fe single atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89 V ) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate&#8208;limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO4 prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25 cm2), demonstrating the advantage of the MOD method in scalable preparation. Our work provides new insight and highlights the glorious future of MOD method for the design of scale&#8208;up efficient BiVO4 photoanode.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics from Metallacages for Mimicking Light&#8208;Harvesting Antenna</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of covalent organic cages built from fluorophores capable of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized M2(LA)3(LB)2&#8208;type metallacages, simultaneously taking advantage of the synthetic accessibility and well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of metallacages, the good chemical stability of the covalent cages as well as the bright emission of AIE fluorophores. Moreover, the covalent cages could be further post&#8208;synthetically modified into an amide&#8208;functionalized cage with a higher quantum yield. Furthermore, these presented covalent cages proved to be good energy donors and were used to construct light&#8208;harvesting systems employing Nile Red as an energy acceptor. These light&#8208;harvesting systems displayed efficient energy transfer and high antenna effect, which enabled their use as efficient photocatalysts for a dehalogenation reaction. This research provides a new avenue for the development of luminescent covalent cages for light&#8208;harvesting and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Relaxing Wrinkles in Jammed Interfacial Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent bonding has emerged as a mean by which stresses in a network can be relaxed. Here, the strength of the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible liquids affect the same results in jammed assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants. Beyond a critical degree of overcrowding induced by the compression of jammed interfacial assemblies, the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles (NPs) can be broken, resulting in a desorption of the NPs from the interface. This reduces the areal density of nanoparticle surfactants at the interface, allowing the assemblies to relax, not to a fluid state but rather another jammed state. The relaxation of the wrinkles caused by the compression reflects the tendency of these assemblies to eliminate areas of high curvature, favoring a more planar geometry. This enabled the generation of giant vesicular and multivesicular structures from these assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinor[7]helicene and Beyond: Divergent Synthesis of Chiral Diradicaloids with Variable Open&#8208;Shell Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diradicaloid helicenes constructed formally by non&#8208;benzenoid double &#960;&#8208;extension of phenanthrene were synthesized by a common strategy involving double electrophilic benzannulation. Steric effects in the second benzannulation step led to considerable structural diversity among the products, yielding a symmetrical dinor[7]helicene 1 and two isomeric unsymmetrical double helicenes 2 and 3, containing a nor[5]helicene and [4]helicene fragment, respectively, in addition to a common nor[6]helicene motif.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diradicaloid helicenes constructed formally by non-benzenoid double &#960;-extension of phenanthrene were synthesized by a common strategy involving double electrophilic benzannulation. Steric effects in the second benzannulation step led to considerable structural diversity among the products, yielding a symmetrical dinor[7]helicene 1 and two isomeric unsymmetrical double helicenes 2 and 3, containing a nor[5]helicene and [4]helicene fragment, respectively, in addition to a common nor[6]helicene motif. Geometries, configurational dynamics, and electronic structure of these helicenes were analyzed using solid-state structures, spectroscopic methods, and computational analyses.

         <title>MET&#8208;Activating Ubiquitin Multimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U&#8208;bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET, derived from MET&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U&#8208;body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso&#8208;grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U&#8208;body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U&#8208;body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF&#8208;induced MET&#8208;phosphorylation. Using the U&#8208;body constructs, their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U&#8208;bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation&#8208;promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso&#8208;grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein&#8208;based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic and Cathodic Platinum Dissolution Processes Involve Different Oxide Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt dissolves transiently during formation and reduction of ultrathin Pt surface oxides, leading to deterioration of Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction electrocatalysts in fuel cells. We observe the formation of two specific Pt surface oxides on Pt(100) and determine their atomic&#8208;scale structure. Pt dissolution during oxidation can be linked to growth of the inner stripe&#8208;like oxide; dissolution during oxide reduction involves the outer amorphous oxide.







Abstract
The degradation of Pt&#8208;containing oxygen reduction catalysts for fuel cell applications is strongly linked to the electrochemical surface oxidation and reduction of Pt. Here, we study the surface restructuring and Pt dissolution mechanisms during oxidation/reduction for the case of Pt(100) in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4 by combining operando high&#8208;energy surface X&#8208;ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry, and density functional theory. Our atomic&#8208;scale structural studies reveal that anodic dissolution, detected during oxidation, and cathodic dissolution, observed during the subsequent reduction, are linked to two different oxide phases. Anodic dissolution occurs predominantly during nucleation and growth of the first, stripe&#8208;like oxide. Cathodic dissolution is linked to a second, amorphous Pt oxide phase that resembles bulk PtO2 and starts to grow when the coverage of the stripe&#8208;like oxide saturates. In addition, we find the amount of surface restructuring after an oxidation/reduction cycle to be potential&#8208;independent after the stripe&#8208;like oxide has reached its saturation coverage.

         <title>Discovery of Two&#8208;dimensional Hexagonal MBene HfBO and Exploration on its Potential for Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical applications of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal borides (MBenes) have been severely hindered by the lack of accessible MBenes because of the difficulties in the selective etching of traditional ternary MAB phases with orthorhombic symmetry (ort&#8208;MAB). Here, we discover a family of ternary hexagonal MAB (h&#8208;MAB) phases and 2D hexagonal MBenes (h&#8208;MBenes) by ab initio predictions and experiments. Calculations suggest that the ternary h&#8208;MAB phases are more suitable precursors for MBenes than the ort&#8208;MAB phases. Based on the prediction, we report the experimental synthesis of h&#8208;MBene HfBO by selective removal of In from h&#8208;MAB Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO delivered a specific capacity of 420 mAh g&#8208;1 as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, demonstrating the potential for energy&#8208;storage applications. The discovery of this h&#8208;MBene HfBO added a new member to the growing family of 2D materials and provided opportunities for a wide range of novel applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Cages &#8208; Towards Nanostructured Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in capsular assemblies such as dynamic organic and coordination cages has blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural variability, these systems have found applications in diverse fields of research, including energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation, molecular recognition, and live&#8208;cell imaging. In the exploration of the potential of these discrete architectures, they are increasingly being employed in the formation of more complex systems and smart materials. This Review highlights the most promising pathways to overcome common drawbacks of cage systems (stability, recovery) and discusses the most promising strategies for their hybridization with systems featuring various dimensionalities. Following the description of the most recent advances in the fabrication of zero to three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;based systems, this Review will provide the reader with the structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the employed cages and the properties of the materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B. multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X. innexi. In turn, the X. innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B. multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B. multivorans and X. innexi through MV exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>General Design Concepts for CAPodes as Ionologic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving are designed providing a generalized concept, resulting in a novel CAPode system with a high rectification ratio (RRII, 96.29&#8201;%) and an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;,&#8216;AND&#8217;). This work provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.







Abstract
Capacitive analogues of semiconductor diodes (CAPodes) present a new avenue for energy&#8208;efficient and nature&#8208;inspired next&#8208;generation computing devices. Here, we disclose the generalized concept for bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving. Controllable&#8208;unidirectional ion flux is realized by blocking electrolyte ions from entering sub&#8208;nanometer pores. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage characteristics with a high rectification ratio (96.29&#8201;%). The enhancement of capacitance is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of an omnisorbing carbon as counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;, &#8216;AND&#8217;).

     alt="General Design Concepts for CAPodes as Ionologic Devices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bias-direction-adjustable n- and p-CAPodes based on selective ion sieving are designed providing a generalized concept, resulting in a novel CAPode system with a high rectification ratio (RR&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;, 96.29&#8201;%) and an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;,&#8216;AND&#8217;). This work provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion-based diodes in ionologic architectures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitive analogues of semiconductor diodes (CAPodes) present a new avenue for energy-efficient and nature-inspired next-generation computing devices. Here, we disclose the generalized concept for bias-direction-adjustable n- and p-CAPodes based on selective ion sieving. Controllable-unidirectional ion flux is realized by blocking electrolyte ions from entering sub-nanometer pores. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge-storage characteristics with a high rectification ratio (96.29&#8201;%). The enhancement of capacitance is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of an omnisorbing carbon as counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;, &#8216;AND&#8217;). This work demonstrates CAPodes as a generalized concept to achieve p-n and n-p analogue junctions based on selective ion electrosorption, provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion-based diodes in ionologic architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective C3&#8208;Allylation of Pyridines via Tandem Borane and Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step method for highly enantioselective C3&#8208;allylation reactions of pyridines was developed. The method involved borane&#8208;catalyzed dearomative pyridine hydroboration, palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dearomatized intermediate, and finally oxidation by air. The method was applicable to a broad range of pyridines, N&#8208;heteroarenes, and allylic esters.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot method for enantioselective C&#8722;H allylation of pyridines at C3 via tandem borane and palladium catalysis. This method involves borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration to generate dihydropyridines, then palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dihydropyridines with allylic esters, and finally air oxidation of the allylated dihydropyridines to afford the products. This method enables the introduction of an allylic group at C3 with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <dc:description>
The STNSP@ELE strategy, employing 2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), can repolarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in situ, overcome immunosuppression and enhance chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This study not only demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of the STNSP&#8208;based nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy for immunosuppressive tumors but also establishes general platforms for 2D nanomaterial&#8208;mediated cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment (TME), yet in situ engineering of TAMs for enhanced tumor immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in translational immuno&#8208;oncology. Here, we report an innovative nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug (STNSP@ELE) strategy that leverages two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), a small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, to overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and improve chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that both STNSP and ELE are capable of polarizing the tumor&#8208;supportive M2&#8208;like TAMs into a tumor&#8208;suppressive M1&#8208;like phenotype, which acts with the ELE chemotherapeutic to boost antitumor responses. In vivo mouse studies demonstrate that STNSP@ELE treatment can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME by significantly increasing the intratumoral ratio of M1/M2&#8208;like TAMs, enhancing the population of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells, and elevating the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines in B16F10 melanomas, thereby promoting a robust antitumor response. Our study not only demonstrates that the STNSP@ELE chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanoplatform has immune&#8208;modulatory capabilities that can overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors, but also highlights the promise of this nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy in developing other nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics and treating various types of immunosuppressive tumors.

         <title>Polymerizable Solvent&#8208;free Organic Liquids: A New Approach for Large Area Flexible and Foldable Luminescent Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polymerizable solvent&#8208;free organic liquid approach has been introduced to overcome the inherent limitations of organic liquid emitters. On&#8208;surface thermochemical polymerization of the hybrid liquids results in flexible&amp;foldable large&#8208;area luminescent films. Our strategy is well suited for developing tunable and white light&#8208;emitting free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area flexible and transparent films suitable for futuristic applications.







Abstract
The high demand for light&#8208;emitting and display devices made luminescent organic materials as attractive candidates. Solvent&#8208;free organic liquids are one of the promising emitters among them due to the salient features. However, the inherent limitations of forming sticky and noncurable surfaces must be addressed to become an alternate emitter for large&#8208;area device applications. Herein, we functionalized solvent&#8208;free organic liquids having monomeric emission in bulk with polymerizable groups to improve the processability. The polymerizable group on carbazole, naphthalene monoimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free liquid emitters enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization. These emitters alone and in combinations can be directly coated on a glass substrate without the help of solvents. Subsequent photo or thermal polymerization leads to stable, non&#8208;sticky, flexible, foldable, and free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area films with reasonably high quantum yield. Our demonstration of the tunable and white light&#8208;emitting films using polymerizable solvent&#8208;free liquids might be a potential candidate in flexible/foldable/stretchable electronics. The new concept of polymerizable liquid can be extended to other functional features suitable for futuristic applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Thin Films as Ideal Matrices for Azide Photolysis in Vacuum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the photo&#8208;mediated reactions of azides in well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;(Da&#8208;SBDC) SURMOF matrices using a solvent&#8208;free approach the initial formation of the nitrene intermediate is shown to be followed by an intramolecular amination yielding an indoloindole. This work offers a novel strategy for precisely controlled chemical transformations of matrix&#8208;isolated azides in crystalline surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs).







Abstract
Studies on reactions in solutions are often hampered by solvent effects. In addition, detailed investigation on kinetics is limited to the small temperature regime where the solvent is liquid. Here, we report the in situ spectroscopic observation of UV&#8208;induced photochemical reactions of aryl azides within a crystalline matrix in vacuum. The matrices are formed by attaching the reactive moieties to ditopic linkers, which are then assembled to yield metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs). These porous, crystalline frameworks are then used as model systems to study azide&#8208;related chemical processes under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, where solvent effects can be safely excluded and in a large temperature regime. Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) allowed us to monitor the photoreaction of azide in SURMOFs precisely. The in situ IRRAS data, in conjunction with XRD, MS, and XPS, reveal that illumination with UV light first leads to forming a nitrene intermediate. In the second step, an intramolecular rearrangement occurs, yielding an indoloindole derivative. These findings unveil a novel pathway for precisely studying azide&#8208;related chemical transformations. Reference experiments carried out for solvent&#8208;loaded SURMOFs reveal a huge diversity of other reaction schemes, thus highlighting the need for model systems studied under UHV conditions.

A series of trioxaadamantanes derived from inositol orthoesters, containing three conjugatable sites, form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). Three drug molecules could be attached per adamantoid scaffold through enzyme&#8208;labile linkages and a successful drug delivery to HeLa cells as their &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion complexes was demonstrated.







Abstract
There is huge demand for developing guests that bind &#946;&#8208;CD and can conjugate multiple cargos for cellular delivery. We synthesized trioxaadamantane derivatives, which can conjugate up to three cargos per guest. 1H NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed these guests form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;CD with association constants in the order of 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Co&#8208;crystallization of &#946;&#8208;CD with guests yielded crystals of their 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes as determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In all cases, trioxaadamantane core is buried within the hydrophobic cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD and three hydroxyl groups are exposed outside. We established biocompatibility using representative candidate G4 and its inclusion complex with &#946;&#8208;CD (&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G4), by MTT assay using HeLa cells. We incubated HeLa cells with rhodamine&#8208;conjugated G4 and established cellular cargo delivery using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. For functional assay, we incubated HeLa cells with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;inclusion complexes of G4&#8208;derived prodrugs G6 and G7, containing one and three units of the antitumor drug (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;camptothecin, respectively. Cells incubated with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 displayed the highest internalization and uniform distribution of camptothecin. &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 showed higher cytotoxicity than G7, camptothecin, G6 and &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G6, affirming the efficiency of adamantoid derivatives in high&#8208;density loading and cargo delivery.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of an Anionic Diazoolefin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic diazoolefin was synthesized. It was found to display a distinct reactivity as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. Furthermore, it can act as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand for metal complexes.







Abstract
Bent (hetero)allenes such as carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes can act as neutral C&#8208;donor ligands, and diverse applications in coordination chemistry have been reported. N&#8208;Heterocyclic diazoolefins are heterocumulenes, which can function in a similar fashion as L&#8208;type ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the reactivity of an anionic diazoolefin. This compound displays distinct reactivity compared to neutral diazoolefins, as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. The anionic diazoolefin can be employed as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand in salt metathesis reactions with metal halide complexes. Extrusion of dinitrogen was observed in a reaction with PCl(NiPr2)2, resulting in a stable phosphinocarbene.

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for recording residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) by NMR spectroscopy is reported by Lo&#239;c Salmon, Christoph Giese and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202305120). The medium relies on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli, is compatible with harsh experimental conditions and allows RDC measurements for proteins, nucleic acids and small organic molecules.

         <title>Integrated Soft Porosity and Electrical Properties of Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;Insulating Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructured nanocrystals are reported by Ken&#8208;ichi Otake, Susumu Kitagawa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303903). These nanocrystals combine soft porosity and electrical properties into a single material. They exhibit semiconductive soft porous interfaces that connect a flexible core and a chemiresistive shell. The cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF nanocrystals demonstrate enhanced selective sorption towards CO2, as well as readable softness, electrical gating, and &#8220;shape memory&#8221; effects for the guest&#8208;responsive iMOF core.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids in stable colloids is critical for their availability and processibility. In their Communication (e202303280), Hang Xing et&#8197;al. report a crown ether surface coordination approach that enables the universal suspension of various MOF powders into immiscible polar and nonpolar solvents, exhibiting exceptional dispersibility without compromising the accessible voids. The crown ether&#8208;coated MOFs exhibit potential as effective phase&#8208;transfer catalysts and enable the fabrication of uniform membranes with improved performances.

         <title>Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#160;(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. This effect is induced by the first water layer that is in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2&#160;(100) surface. This ordered water layer creates a key&#8208;lock H&#8208;bond pattern with the underlying surface hydroxyl groups, hindering the interactions with liquid water. The hydrophobicity is manifested by a measurable water contact angle and a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water, as reported by Lorenzo Agosta, Kersti Hermansson et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202303910). We acknowledge Virginia Carnevali for her help with the cover image.

         <title>Twisted Diindeno&#8208;Fused Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene Derivatives and their Dianions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituents of different sizes have been used to synthesize diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity. The twisting of the neutral antiaromatic compounds led to them being endowed with chirality, as well as enhanced energy gaps with decreased diradical character. Furthermore, the doubly reduced species exhibited global aromaticity and decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity.







Abstract
We report a facile synthesis of diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives (DIDBA&#8208;2Cl, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph, and DIDBA&#8208;2H) with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity using three substituents (chloro, phenyl, and hydrogen) of various sizes. The planarization of their cores, as evidenced by the decreased end&#8208;to&#8208;end torsional angles, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their enhanced energy gaps with twisting were investigated by a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods with density functional theory, which showed a transition from singlet open&#8208;shell to closed&#8208;shell configuration. Moreover, their doubly reduced states, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph2&#8722; and DIDBA&#8208;2H2&#8722;, were achieved by chemical reduction. The structures of dianions were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which elucidated that the electron charging further distorted the backbones. The electronic structure of the dianions was demonstrated by experimental and theoretical approaches, suggesting decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity, different from the neutral species.

         <title>Hierarchical LTL Zeolite as an Efficient and Sustainable Solid Acid Catalyst for Replacing HCl in the Production of Polyurethane Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits remarkable catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in the conversion of aminal to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA), an important precursor for polyurethane production. External Br&#248;nsted acid sites convert aminal to aminobenzylaniline, whereas 1D cage&#8208;like micropores induces self&#8208;assembly of two linear para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline molecules and their bimolecular conversion into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDAs.







Abstract
In many industrially important reactions, caustic mineral acid catalysts have been successfully replaced with green solid acids such as zeolites. In this context, extensive efforts have been devoted to replacing HCl to produce methylenedianiline (MDA), a key intermediate in polyurethane production. Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved thus far due to low activity, selectivity towards the desired 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA, and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here we report that meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits unprecedentedly high activity, selectivity, and stability. The one&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like micropores of LTL promote the bimolecular reaction between two para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline intermediates to selectively produce 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA and inhibit the formation of undesired isomers and heavy oligomers. Meanwhile, the secondary mesopores alleviate mass transfer limitations, resulting in a 7.8&#8208;fold higher MDA formation rate compared to solely microporous LTL zeolite. Due to suppressed oligomer formation and fast mass transfer, the catalyst exhibits inappreciable deactivation in an industrially relevant continuous flow reactor.

         <title>An Inorganic Click Reaction for the Synthesis of Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the use of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of a new class of inorganic rotaxanes containing gold(I) triazaphosphole stoppers. Electron&#8208;deficient bis&#8208;azides, which thread perethylated pillar[5]arene in aromatic solvents, readily react with two equivalents of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to afford interlocked molecules via an inorganic click reaction. These transformations proceed in good yields (ca. 65%) and in the absence of a catalyst. The resulting organometallic rotaxanes are air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable and can be purified by column chromatography under aerobic conditions. The targeted rotaxanes were characterized by multi&#8208;element nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass&#8208;spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Units as Photocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a promising platform for photocatalysts. Their crystalline porous nature allows comprehensive mechanistic studies of photocatalysis, which have revealed that their general photophysical parameters, such as light absorption ability, electronic band structure, and charge separation efficiency, can be conveniently tailored by structural modifications. However, further understanding of the relationship between structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity is required from the viewpoint of charge&#8208;carrier transport, because the charge&#8208;carrier property is closely related to alleviation of the excitonic effect. In the present study, COFs composed of a fixed cobalt (Co) porphyrin (Por) centered tetraamine as an acceptor unit with differently conjugated dicarbaldehyde based donor units, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), thienothiophene (TT), or phenyl (TA), were synthesized to form CoPor&#8208;BDT, Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT, or Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide was in the order of Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT &gt; Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT &gt; Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA. The results indicated that the excitonic effect, associated with their charge&#8208;carrier densities and &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, was a significant factor in photocatalysis performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reforming the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase by nanoscale structure regulation for stable lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries depends on the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes. Rationally improving SEI uniformity is hindered by poorly understanding the effect of structure and components of SEI on its uniformity. Herein, a bilayer structure of SEI formed by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes was demonstrated to improve SEI uniformity. In the bilayer SEI, LiNxOy generated by ISDN occupies top layer and LiF dominates bottom layer next to anode. The uniformity of lithium deposition is remarkably improved with the bilayer SEI, mitigating the consumption rate of active Li and electrolytes. The cycle life of lithium metal batteries with bilayer SEI is three times as that with common anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions. A prototype lithium metal pouch cell of 430 Wh kg&#8722;1 undergoes 173 cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of a reasonable structure of SEI on reforming SEI uniformity.</dc:description>

         <title>Eliminating Concentration Polarization with Cationic Covalent Organic Polymer to Promote Effective Overpotential of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge. The whole network exhibits strong positive charge and effectively repels the positively charged ammonium, enabling an ultra&#8208;low interfacial product concentration, and successfully driving the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a continuous high&#8208;level reaction rate. As expected, when this tailored microenvironment is coupled with a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst, a 24&#8208;fold improvement is generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74 %) as compared with the bare one. The proposed strategy underscores the importance of optimizing dynamic processes as a means of improving overall performance in electrochemical syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Tryptophan in Multicomponent Petasis Reactions for Peptide Stapling and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;component peptide stapling is an appealing method for preparing enzymatically stable peptides with incorporated biologically relevant tags. An unprecedented approach, utilising the tryptophan&#8208;mediated multicomponent Petasis reaction (TMPR), facilitates the generation of stapled peptides and enables their late&#8208;stage functionalisation. A variety of examples are presented to highlight the advantages of the method.







Abstract
Peptide stapling is a robust strategy for generating enzymatically stable, macrocyclic peptides. The incorporation of biologically relevant tags (such as cell&#8208;penetrating motifs or fluorescent dyes) into peptides, while preserving their binding interactions and enhancing their stability, is highly sought after. Despite the unique opportunities offered by tryptophan&#8216;s indole scaffold for targeted functionalisation, its utilisation in peptide stapling has been limited as compared to other amino acids. Herein, we present an approach for peptide stapling using the tryptophan&#8208;mediated Petasis reaction. This method enables the synthesis of both stapled and labelled peptides and is applicable to both solution and solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Importantly, the use of the Petasis reaction in combination with tryptophan facilitates the formation of stapled peptides in a straightforward, multicomponent fashion, while circumventing the formation of undesired by&#8208;products. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient and diverse late&#8208;stage peptide modifications, thereby enabling rapid production of numerous conjugates for biological and medicinal applications.

         <title>Reprocessible Triketoenamine&#8208;Based Vitrimers with Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triketoenamine&#8208;based dynamic covalent network was developed that is dual&#8208;recyclable: by mechanical reprocessing and chemically recycled in a closed loop. The work sheds light on the future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.







Abstract
Development of thermosets that can be repeatedly recycled via both chemical route (closed&#8208;loop) and thermo&#8208;mechanical process is attractive and remains an imperative task. In this work, we reported a triketoenamine based dynamic covalent network derived from 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and secondary amines. The resulting triketoenamine based network does not have intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thus reducing its &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, lowering the stability of the tautomer structure, and enabling its dynamic feature. By virtue of the highly reversible bond exchange, this novel dynamic covalent bond enables the easy construction of highly crosslinked and chemically reprocessable networks from commercially available monomers. The as&#8208;made polymer monoliths exhibit high mechanical properties (tensile strength of 79.4&#8197;MPa and Young's modulus of 571.4&#8197;MPa) and can undergo a monomer&#8208;network&#8208;monomer (yields up to 90&#8201;%) recycling mediated by an aqueous solution, with the new&#8208;generation polymer capable of restoring the material strength to its original state. In addition, owing to its dynamic nature, a catalyst&#8208;free and low&#8208;temperature reprogrammable covalent adaptable network (vitrimer) was achieved. The design concept reported herein can be applied to the development of other novel vitrimers with high repressibility and recyclability, and sheds light on future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>p&#8208;Block Bismuth Nanoclusters Sites Activated by Atomically Dispersed Bismuth for Tandem Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based electrocatalysts composed of bismuth nanoclusters and atomically dispersed bismuth is prepared for highly selective electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction into hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms, demonstrating synergistic catalysis between single&#8208;atomic sites and nanoclusters.







Abstract
Constructing electrocatalysts with p&#8208;block elements is generally considered rather challenging owing to their closed d shells. Here for the first time, we present a p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based (Bi&#8208;based) catalyst with the co&#8208;existence of single&#8208;atomic Bi sites coordinated with oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) atoms and Bi nanoclusters (Biclu) (collectively denoted as BiOSSA/Biclu) for the highly selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As a result, BiOSSA/Biclu gives a high H2O2 selectivity of 95&#8201;% in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode, and a large current density of 36&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.15&#8197;V vs. RHE, a considerable H2O2 yield of 11.5&#8197;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with high H2O2 Faraday efficiency of &#8764;90&#8201;% at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE and a long&#8208;term durability of &#8764;22&#8197;h in H&#8208;cell test. Interestingly, the experimental data on site poisoning and theoretical calculations both revealed that, for BiOSSA/Biclu, the catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms. This work demonstrates a new synergistic tandem strategy for advanced p&#8208;block&#8208;element Bi catalysts featuring atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites, and the great potential of rational material design for constructing highly active electrocatalysts based on p&#8208;block metals.

         <title>Molecular Bridge on Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bridge link strategy for buried surface with perovskite provides superior defect passivation and energy alignment by employing the rationally selected mediator of glycocyamine. The interface enables slower crystal growth with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes. The modified planar perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.70&#8201;% with an open circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V and retains 89&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 800&#8197;h.







Abstract
The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly important for charge transfer and device stability, while the buried interface with the impact on perovskite film growth has been paid less attention. Herein, we use a molecular modifier, glycocyamine (GDA) to build a molecular bridge on the buried interface of SnO2/perovskite, resulting in superior interfacial contact. This is achieved through the strongly interaction between GDA and SnO2, which also appreciably modulates the energy level. Moreover, GDA can regulate the perovskite crystal growth, yielding perovskite film with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes, exhibiting substantially reduced defect density. Consequently, PSCs with GDA modification demonstrate significant improvement of open circuit voltage (close to 1.2&#8197;V) and fill factor, leading to an improved power conversion efficiency from 22.60&#8201;% to 24.70&#8201;%. Additionally, stabilities of GDA devices under maximum power point and 85&#8201;&#176;C heat both perform better than the control devices.

         <title>meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized pyridines have broad applications in chemical science. However, direct functionalization of pyridine C&#8722;H bonds at the meta&#8208;position is difficult. Significant advances have been achieved in recent years through directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation or temporary dearomatization strategies. Herein, we describe the advances and challenges in the development of meta&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines.







Abstract
The pyridine moiety is an important core structure for a variety of drugs, agrochemicals, catalysts, and functional materials. Direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in pyridines is a straightforward approach to access valuable substituted pyridines. Compared to the direct ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization, meta&#8208;selective pyridine C&#8722;H functionalization is far more challenging due to the inherent electronic properties of the pyridine entity. This review summarizes currently available methods for pyridine meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization using a directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation, and temporary dearomatization strategies. Recent advances in ligand control and temporary dearomatization are highlighted. We analyze the advantages as well as limitations of current techniques and hope to inspire further developments in this important area.

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ Cyanidation Strategy To Access Tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene Diimides with High Electron Mobilities Exceeding 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>

A facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy has been adopted to access highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs) with the in&#8208;situ installation of four cyano substitutents at room temperature. The TCDADIs feature a coplanar backbone, high electron affinity, and high crystallinity, which are a benefit for the electron&#8208;transport performance, with impressive electron mobilities of above 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 obtained.







Abstract
A family of novel highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyano&#8208;substituted acene diimides, named as tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs), have been synthesized using a facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy. Unlike conventional cyano substitution reactions, our approach enables access to a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone with the in&#8208;situ formation of four cyano substitutents at room temperature while avoiding extra cyano&#8208;functionalization reactions. TCDADIs decorated with different N&#8208;alkyl substituents present good solubility, near&#8208;coplanar backbones, good crystallinity, and low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of &#8722;4.33&#8197;eV, all of which contribute to desirable electron&#8208;transport performance when applied in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET). The highest electron mobility of an OFET based on a 2&#8208;hexyldecyl&#8208;substituted TCDADI single crystal reaches 12.6&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is not only among the highest values for the reported n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials (OSMs) but also exceeds that of most n&#8208;type OSMs decorated with imide units.

         <title>Li Plating Regulation on Fast&#8208;Charging Graphite Anodes by a Triglyme&#8208;LiNO3 Synergistic Electrolyte Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a strategy of Li plating regulation rather than Li plating inhibition. Under this situation, Li plating on graphite has a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and a high reversibility. By effectively utilizing Li plating instead of suppressing it, it is possible to achieve a compatible pathway for fast charging of graphite anodes.







Abstract
Graphite anodes are prone to dangerous Li plating during fast charging, but the difficulty to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step has made a challenging to eliminate Li plating thoroughly. Thus, the inherent thinking on inhibiting Li plating needs to be compromised. Herein, an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform Li&#8208;ion flux is constructed on graphite anode by introducing a triglyme (G3)&#8208;LiNO3 synergistic additive (GLN) to commercial carbonate electrolyte, for realizing a dendrite&#8208;free and highly&#8208;reversible Li plating under high rates. The cross&#8208;linked oligomeric ether and Li3N particles derived from the GLN greatly improve the stability of the SEI before and after Li plating and facilitate the uniform Li deposition. When 51&#8201;% of lithiation capacity is contributed from Li plating, the graphite anode in the electrolyte with 5 vol.% GLN achieved an average 99.6&#8201;% Li plating reversibility over 100&#8197;cycles. In addition, the 1.2&#8208;Ah LiFePO4 | graphite pouch cell with GLN&#8208;added electrolyte stably operated over 150&#8197;cycles at 3&#8197;C, firmly demonstrating the promise of GLN in commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries for fast&#8208;charging applications.

         <title>Anti&#8208;inflammatory Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for Colitis Treatment: Construction and In Vivo Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of bilirubin&#8208;attached glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles was constructed as a platform enabling identification of an anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicine. Direct in vivo screening of the nanoparticle library by oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicine capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms.







Abstract
Common medications for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have limited therapeutic efficacy and severe adverse effects. This underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively target inflamed sites in the gastrointestinal tract upon oral administration, exerting potent therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic effects. Here, we report the construction and in vivo therapeutic evaluation of a library of anti&#8208;inflammatory glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (designated GlyNPs) in a mouse model of IBD. The anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNP library was created by attaching bilirubin (BR) to a library of glycopolymers composed of random combinations of the five most naturally abundant sugars. Direct in vivo screening of 31&#8197;BR&#8208;attached anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNPs via oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate GlyNP capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms. These findings suggest that the BR&#8208;attached GlyNP library can be used as a platform to identify anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicines for various inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Catalytic &#963;&#8208;Bond Annulation with Ambiphilic Organohalides Enabled by &#946;&#8208;X Elimination
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a &#963;&#8208;bond annulation strategy that combines strong bond activation via &#946;&#8208;heteroatom elimination and redox&#8208;neutral annulation along a PdII/PdIV redox manifold to access 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Various alkyl C(sp3)&#8722;O, N, and S bonds can be selectively activated, allowing for enantioenriched amino acid derivatives and low&#8208;strain heterocycles to be converted into value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
We describe a catalytic cascade sequence involving directed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation followed by &#946;&#8208;heteroatom elimination to generate a PdII(&#960;&#8208;alkene) intermediate that then undergoes redox&#8208;neutral annulation with an ambiphilic aryl halide to access 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)cycles. Various alkyl C(sp3)&#8722;oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur bonds can be selectively activated, and the annulation proceeds with high diastereoselectivity. The method enables modification of amino acids with good retention of enantiomeric excess, as well as &#963;&#8208;bond ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing transfiguration of low&#8208;strain heterocycles. Despite its mechanistic complexity, the method employs simple conditions and is operationally straightforward to perform.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a catalytic cascade sequence involving directed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation followed by &#946;-heteroatom elimination to generate a Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&#960;-alkene) intermediate that then undergoes redox-neutral annulation with an ambiphilic aryl halide to access 5- and 6-membered (hetero)cycles. Various alkyl C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur bonds can be selectively activated, and the annulation proceeds with high diastereoselectivity. The method enables modification of amino acids with good retention of enantiomeric excess, as well as &#963;-bond ring-opening/ring-closing transfiguration of low-strain heterocycles. Despite its mechanistic complexity, the method employs simple conditions and is operationally straightforward to perform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Bimetallic Catalysis via One&#8208;Metal/Two&#8208;Ligands: Mechanistic Insights of Polyfluoroarylation&#8208;Allylation of Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative bimetallic catalysis via one&#8208;metal/two&#8208;ligands in situ assembling is developed in geminal polyfluoroarylation&#8208;allylation of diazo esters, delivering products bearing a 1,1&#8242;&#8208;aryl, polyfluoroaryl quaternary carbon center. Detailed mechanistic investigation disclosed unique roles of two distinct ligands, suggesting two in situ formed Pd complexes display different reactivities and work cooperatively in two catalytic cycles.







Abstract
Metal/ligand in situ assembly is crucial for tailoring the reactivity &amp; selectivity in transition metal catalysis. Cooperative catalysis via a single metal/two ligands is still underdeveloped, since it is rather challenging to harness the distinct reactivity profiles of the species generated by self&#8208;assembly of a single metal precursor with a mixture of different ligands. Herein, we report a catalytic system composed of a single metal/two ligands for a three&#8208;component reaction of polyfluoroarene, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and allylic electrophile, leading to highly efficient construction of densely functionalized quaternary carbon centers, that are otherwise hardly accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest this reaction follows a cooperative bimetallic pathway via two catalysts with distinct reactivity profiles, which are assembled in situ from a single metal precursor and two ligands and work in concert to escort the transformation.

         <title>Divergent Stabilities of Tetravalent Cerium, Uranium, and Neptunium Imidophosphorane Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual redox properties of Ce, U, and Np in a homoleptic imidophosporane ligand field include large cathodic shifts in the M4+/3+ (M=Ce, U, Np) couples and an unprecedented, well&#8208;behaved Np5+/4+ redox couple. This homoleptic ligand field, in effect, shifts the conventional redox stabilities of the mid&#8208;actinides to redefine the readily accessible oxidation states.







Abstract
The study of the redox chemistry of mid&#8208;actinides (U&#8722;Pu) has historically relied on cerium as a model, due to the accessibility of trivalent and tetravalent oxidation states for these ions. Recently, dramatic shifts of lanthanide 4+/3+ non&#8208;aqueous redox couples have been established within a homoleptic imidophosphorane ligand framework. Herein we extend the chemistry of the imidophosphorane ligand (NPC=[N=PtBu(pyrr)2]&#8722;; pyrr=pyrrolidinyl) to tetrahomoleptic NPC complexes of neptunium and cerium (1&#8208;M, 2&#8208;M, M=Np, Ce) and present comparative structural, electrochemical, and theoretical studies of these complexes. Large cathodic shifts in the M4+/3+ (M=Ce, U, Np) couples underpin the stabilization of higher metal oxidation states owing to the strongly donating nature of the NPC ligands, providing access to the U5+/4+, U6+/5+, and to an unprecedented, well&#8208;behaved Np5+/4+ redox couple. The differences in the chemical redox properties of the U vs. Ce and Np complexes are rationalized based on their redox potentials, degree of structural rearrangement upon reduction/oxidation, relative molecular orbital energies, and orbital composition analyses employing density functional theory.

         <title>Bis(1&#8208;Methyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;Carboranyl)Borane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis superacidic secondary borane, bis(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (HBMeoCb2) has been synthesized and is demonstrated to be a very reactive hydroboration reagent. It can perform regioselective 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, a unique 1,1&#8208;hydroboration for acetylenes featuring an aryl and silyl substituent, and the formal 1,3&#8208;hydroboration of cyclopropanes, all without the need of a catalyst.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid, bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane, is rapidly accessed in two steps. It is a very effective hydroboration reagent capable of B&#8722;H addition to alkenes, alkynes, and cyclopropanes. To date, this is the first identified Lewis superacidic secondary borane and most reactive neutral hydroboration reagent.

         <title>Instantaneous Free Radical Scavenging by CeO2 Nanoparticles Adjacent to the Fe&#8722;N4 Active Sites for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2 nanoparticles as radicals scavengers are successfully anchored adjacent to the Fe&#8722;N4 active sites by a two&#8208;step metalorganic gaseous doping approach. Radicals generated at Fe&#8722;N4 sites can be instantaneously scavenged by adjacent CeO2. This greatly improves the scavenging rate of radicals by CeO2 and effectively mitigated the degradation of M&#8722;N molecules by radicals, thus improving the durability of the ORR catalyst.







Abstract
To achieve the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C materials with both high activity and durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the attack of free radicals on Fe&#8722;N4 sites must be overcome. Herein, we report a strategy to effectively eliminate radicals at the source to mitigate the degradation by anchoring CeO2 nanoparticles as radicals scavengers adjacent (Scaad&#8208;CeO2) to the Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Radicals such as &#8901;OH and HO2&#8901; that form at Fe&#8722;N4 sites can be instantaneously eliminated by adjacent CeO2, which shortens the survival time of radicals and the regional space of their damage. As a result, the CeO2 scavengers in Fe&#8722;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 achieved &#8764;80&#8201;% elimination of the radicals generated at the Fe&#8722;N4 sites. A fuel cell prepared with the Fe&#8722;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 showed a smaller peak power density decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles determined with US DOE PGM&#8208;relevant AST, increasing the decay of Fe&#8722;NCPhen from 69&#8201;% to 28&#8201;% decay.

         <title>Direct Light&#8208;Enabled Access to &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Application in the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Allyl Boronic Esters
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Boryl radicals have reemerged as versatile intermediates to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. We disclose a facile activation of &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters using light and a Lewis base to permit homolytic scission. Addition to styrenes allows the construction of E&#8208;allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger with energy transfer catalysis to enable the stereodivergent synthesis of Z&#8208;isomers.







Abstract
Operationally simple strategies to assemble boron containing organic frameworks are highly enabling in organic synthesis. While conventional retrosynthetic logic has engendered many platforms focusing on the direct formation of C&#8722;B bonds, &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals have recently reemerged as versatile open&#8208;shell alternatives to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. Direct light&#8208;enabled &#945;&#8208;activation is currently contingent on photo&#8208; or transition metal&#8208;catalysis activation to efficiently generate radical species. Here, we disclose a facile activation of &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters using only visible light and a simple Lewis base to enable homolytic scission. Intermolecular addition to styrenes facilitates the rapid construction of highly versatile E&#8208;allylic boronic esters.

&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Boryl radicals have reemerged as versatile intermediates to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. We disclose a facile activation of &#945;-halo boronic esters using light and a Lewis base to permit homolytic scission. Addition to styrenes allows the construction of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger with energy transfer catalysis to enable the stereodivergent synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operationally simple strategies to assemble boron containing organic frameworks are highly enabling in organic synthesis. While conventional retrosynthetic logic has engendered many platforms focusing on the direct formation of C&#8722;B bonds, &#945;-boryl radicals have recently reemerged as versatile open-shell alternatives to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. Direct light-enabled &#945;-activation is currently contingent on photo- or transition metal-catalysis activation to efficiently generate radical species. Here, we disclose a facile activation of &#945;-halo boronic esters using only visible light and a simple Lewis base to enable homolytic scission. Intermolecular addition to styrenes facilitates the rapid construction of highly versatile &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger of this construct with selective energy transfer catalysis to enable the complimentary stereodivergent synthesis of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-allylic boronic esters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evidence for Carbene Intermediates in Isocyanide Homologation by Aluminium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the reaction between a neutral AlI complex (1) and isocyanides as Fischer&#8211;Tropsch model enables the isolation of diverse homologation products, including a pentamolecular coupling product (9). Through combined experimental and computational studies, a step&#8208;by&#8208;step mechanism involving carbenes as key intermediates has been elucidated.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation between C1 molecules plays an important role in chemistry as manifested by the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) process. Serving as models for the FT process, we report here the reactions between a neutral AlI complex (MeNacNac)Al (1, MeNacNac=HC[(CMe)(NDipp)]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and various isocyanides. The step&#8208;by&#8208;step coupling mechanism was studied in detail by low&#8208;temperature NMR monitoring, isotopic labeling, as well as quantum chemical calculations. Three different products were isolated in reaction of 1 with the sterically encumbered 2,6&#8208;bis(benzhydryl)&#8208;4&#8208;Me&#8208;phenyl isocyanide (BhpNC). These products substantiate carbene intermediates. The reaction between 1 and adamantyl isocyanide (AdNC) generated a trimerization product, and a corresponding carbene intermediate could be trapped in the form of a molybdenum(0) complex. Tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and even pentamerization products were isolated with the sterically less congested phenyl and p&#8208;methoxyphenyl isocyanides (PhNC and PMPNC) with concurrent construction of quinoline or indole heterocycles. Overall, this study provides evidence for carbene intermediates in FT&#8208;type chemistry of aluminium(I) and isocyanides.

         <title>Highly Oxidative&#8208;Resistant Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Lithium Borate Salt for Enhanced Cycling Performance of Practical Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly oxidative&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;functionalized lithium borate salt, lithium difluoro(1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) borate (LiDFTCB), is designed to enhance cycling performance of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Owing to its intrinsic anionic structure and the thin and robust electrolyte/electrode layers formed by LiDFTCB, the LiCoO2/graphite cells show superior cycling stability at 50&#8201;&#176;C with barely any CO2 gas evolution.







Abstract
Lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) has been widely investigated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its advantageous thermal stability and excellent aluminum passivation property. However, LiDFOB tends to suffer from severe decomposition and generate a lot of gas species (e.g., CO2). Herein, a novel cyano&#8208;functionalized lithium borate salt, namely lithium difluoro(1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) borate (LiDFTCB), is innovatively synthesized as a highly oxidative&#8208;resistant salt to alleviate above dilemma. It is revealed that the LiDFTCB&#8208;based electrolyte enables LiCoO2/graphite cells with superior capacity retention at both room and elevated temperatures (e.g., 80&#8201;% after 600&#8197;cycles) with barely any CO2 gas evolution. Systematic studies reveal that LiDFTCB tends to form thin and robust interfacial layers at both electrodes. This work emphasizes the crucial role of cyano&#8208;functionalized anions in improving cycle lifespan and safety of practical LIBs.

         <title>Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with Precursor Coisolation Improves Proteome Coverage and Measurement Throughput for Label&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new data acquisition strategy for biological mass spectrometry, termed wide&#8208;window acquisition, combined with efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography, enables single&#8208;cell proteome profiling to an unprecedented depth of &gt;3000 proteins per cell. This advance allows additional classes of proteins to be studied within single cells.







Abstract
We combined efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography with a newly developed data acquisition and analysis scheme termed wide window acquisition (WWA) to quantify &gt;3,000 proteins from single cells in rapid label&#8208;free analyses. WWA employs large isolation windows to intentionally co&#8208;isolate and co&#8208;fragment adjacent precursors along with the selected precursor. Optimized WWA increased the number of MS2&#8208;identified proteins by &#8776;40&#8201;% relative to standard data&#8208;dependent acquisition. For a 40&#8208;min LC gradient operated at &#8776;15 nL/min, we identified an average of 3,524 proteins per single&#8208;cell&#8208;sized aliquot of protein digest. Reducing the active gradient to 20&#8197;min resulted in a modest 10&#8201;% decrease in proteome coverage. Using this platform, we compared protein expression between single HeLa cells having an essential autophagy gene, atg9a, knocked out, with their isogenic WT parental line. Similar proteome coverage was observed, and 268 proteins were significantly up&#8208; or downregulated. Protein upregulation primarily related to innate immunity, vesicle trafficking and protein degradation.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution through Retarded Charge Trapping and Recombination by Continuously Distributed Defects in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defects is proposed to promote the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts for H2 evolution. The continuously distributed defects in the deliberately designed MAPbI3 photocatalysts retard charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance as confirmed by combining the atomic force microscopy&#8208;based infrared and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopies.







Abstract
Inspired by its great success in the photovoltaic field, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) has recently been actively explored as photocatalysts in H2 evolution reactions. However, the practical application of MAPbI3 photocatalysts remains hampered by the intrinsically fast trapping and recombination of photogenerated charges. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defective areas to promote charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts. By deliberately designing and synthesizing the MAPbI3 photocatalysts featuring a unique continuation of defective areas, we demonstrate that such a feature enables retardation of charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance. As an outcome, such MAPbI3 photocatalysts turn out to achieve an impressive photocatalytic H2 evolution rate as high as 0.64&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, one order of magnitude higher than that of the conventional MAPbI3 photocatalysts. This work establishes a new paradigm for controlling charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photocatalysis.

         <title>Photoluminescence Anisotropy in Eutectic Crystals of Polynuclear Lanthanide Complexes and Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eutectic of Ag clusters and polynuclear lanthanide complexes induces fluorescence anisotropy. Investigation of the excitation polarization mechanism confirmed that the electrons in the ground state have higher transition efficiency when the direction of the electric field vibration of the photon and the direction of the molecular electric transition dipole moment are parallel.







Abstract
Anisotropy is an intrinsic property of crystalline materials. However, the photoluminescence anisotropy in eutectic crystals of organometallic complexes has remained unexplored. Herein, the eutectic of polynuclear lanthanide complexes and Ag clusters was prepared, and the crystal shows significant photoluminescence anisotropy. The polarization anisotropy of emission &#948; and degree of excitation polarization P are 2.62 and 0.53, respectively. The rare excitation polarization properties have been proved to be related to the regular arrangement of electric transition dipole moments of luminescent molecules in the crystal. Our design provides a reference for developing new photoluminescence anisotropy materials and expanding their applications.

         <title>Benzidine Derivatives: A Class of High Redox Potential Molecules for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines, a series of water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable high redox potentials (0.78&#8208;1.01&#8197;V vs. SHE) were obtained. The impressive battery performance based on N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraethylbenzidine pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte suggested that benzidine derivatives could be promising catholyte materials for aqueous organic flow batteries.







Abstract
The development of water&#8208;soluble redox&#8208;active molecules with high potentials is one of the effective ways to enhance the energy density of aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). Herein, a series of promising N&#8208;substituted benzidine analogues as water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable redox potentials (0.78&#8211;1.01&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) were obtained by the molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines. Theoretical calculations reveal that the redox potentials of these benzidine derivatives in acidic solution are determined by their electronic structure and alkalinity. Among these benzidine derivatives, N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraethylbenzidine(TEB) shows both high redox potential (0.82&#8197;V vs. SHE) and good solubility (1.1&#8197;M). Pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte, the cell displayed discharge capacity retention of 99.4&#8201;% per cycle and a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of &#8764;100&#8201;% over 1200&#8197;cycles. The stable discharge capacity of 41.8&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 was achieved at the 1.0&#8197;M TEB catholyte with a CE of 97.2&#8201;% and energy efficiency (EE) of 91.2&#8201;%, demonstrating that N&#8208;substituted benzidines could be promising for AOFBs.

         <title>Degradable, Ultraviolet&#8208;Crosslinked Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Adhesives Made from Thioester&#8208;Functional Acrylate Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives in commercial labels and sticky tape contain irreversibly crosslinked, insoluble, networks that hamper the recycling of cardboard and glass. This work establishes that degradable poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) networks featuring backbone thioesters have optimal adhesive properties and can be degraded on demand into fully soluble products.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are made from soft, irreversibly lightly crosslinked polymers. Even after removal from surfaces, they retain insoluble networks which pose problems during the recycling of glass and cardboard. Herein, degradable PSAs are presented that provide the required performance in use but have networks that can be degraded after use. A series of copolymers was prepared through radical copolymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate, 4&#8208;acryloyloxy benzophenone (ABP) photo&#8208;crosslinker, and dibenzo[c,e]oxepin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;thione (DOT) to provide degradable backbone thioesters. The optimum tack and peel strengths were found for molar contents of 0.05&#8197;mol% ABP and 0.25&#8197;mol% DOT. Degradation of the backbone thioesters through aminolysis or thiolysis led to the full dissolution of the networks, loss of adhesive properties of films (decreases in the measured tack and peel strengths), and the quick detachment of model labels from a substrate. Inclusion of DOT into PSAs offers a viable route toward degradable and recyclable packaging labels.

         <title>Overlooked Formation of Carbonate Radical Anions in the Oxidation of Iron(II) by Oxygen in the Presence of Bicarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron(II), (Fe(H2O)62+, (Fe(II)) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of Fe(II) oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O2, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO3&#8208;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO3&#8208;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O2&#9679;&#8208;, H2O2, and HO&#9679;) in Fe(II) oxidation by O2 has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#9679;&#8208;) in the oxidation of Fe(II) by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO3&#8208;. The rate of the formation of CO3&#9679;&#8208; may be expressed as d[CO3&#9679;&#8208;]/dt = [Fe(II)[[O2][HCO3&#8208;]2. The formation of reactive species was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of Fe(II) oxidation by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#9679;&#8208; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitchable Benzimidazole Azo&#8208;Arenes as &#946;&#8208;Arrestin2&#8208;Biased Selective Cannabinoid 2 Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoswitchable scaffold was developed based on the &#8220;privileged structure&#8221; of benzimidazole: 2&#8208;benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes. This scaffold was used for the development of functionally selective cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) ligands with &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) bias. Compound 10&#8201;d acts as a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;efficacy switch in &#946;arr2&#8208;mediated endocytosis and can be used to investigate the CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 endocytic pathway.







Abstract
The cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) has high therapeutic potential for multiple pathogenic processes, such as neuroinflammation. Pathway&#8208;selective ligands are needed to overcome the lack of clinical success and to elucidate correlations between pathways and their respective therapeutic effects. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a photoswitchable scaffold based on the privileged structure of benzimidazole and its application as a functionally selective CB2R &#8220;efficacy&#8208;switch&#8221;. Benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes offer huge potential for the broad extension of photopharmacology to a wide range of optically addressable biological targets. We used this scaffold to develop compound 10&#8201;d, a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221; agonist, which serves as a molecular probe to study the &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) pathway at CB2R. &#946;&#913;rr2 bias was observed in CB2R internalization and &#946;arr2 recruitment, while no activation occurred when looking at G&#945;16 or mini&#8208;G&#945;i. Overall, compound 10&#8201;d is the first light&#8208;dependent functionally selective agonist to investigate the complex mechanisms of CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 dependent endocytosis.

Overall, compound &lt;b&gt;10&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt; is the first light-dependent functionally selective agonist to investigate the complex mechanisms of CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-&#946;arr2 dependent endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistor Based on Hydrophobic Polymer Tuned by Ionic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic conjugated polymers have poor ionic transport property, so hydrophilic side chains are often grafted for their application as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, this modification lowers their charge transport ability. Here, an ionic gel interfacial layer is applied to improve the ionic transport while retaining the charge transport ability of the polymers. By using the ionic gels comprising gel matrix and ionic liquids as the interfacial layers, the hydrophobic polymer achieves the OECT feature with high transconductance, low threshold voltage, high current on/off ratio, short switching time, and high operational stability. The working mechanism is also revealed. Moreover, the OECT performance can be tuned by varying the types and ratios of ionic gels. With the proposed ionic gel strategy, OECTs can be effectively realized with hydrophobic conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porous Crystalline Nitrone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, by combining N,&#160;N',&#160;N',&#160;N'''&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl))tetrakis(hydroxylamine)and terephthaladehyde via a polycondensation reaction. The formation of the nitrone functionality was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 13C multi cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy of the 13C&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled COF&#8208;115 and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. The permanent porosity of COF&#8208;115 was evaluated through low&#8208;pressure N2, CO2, and H2 sorption experiments. Water vapor and carbon dioxide sorption analysis of COF&#8208;115 and the isoreticular imine&#8208;linked COF indicated a superior potential of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications. Density functional theory calculations provided valuable insights into the difference between the adsorption properties of these COFs. Lastly, photoinduced rearrangement of COF&#8208;115 to the associated amide&#8208;linked material was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>A Generic Platform for Upcycling Polystyrene to Aryl Ketones and Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polystyrene (PS) is one of the least recycled large&#8208;volume commodity plastics due to bulkiness of foam products and associated contaminants. PS recycling is also severely hampered by the lack of financial incentive, limited versatility, and poor selectivity of existing methods. To this end, herein we report a thermochemical recycling strategy of &#8220;degradation&#8208;upcycling&#8221; to synthesize a library of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals from PS wastes with high versability and selectivity. Two cascade reactions are selected to first degrade PS into benzene under mild temperatures, followed by the derivatization thereof utilizing a variety of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chloride additives. To demonstrate the versatility, nine ketones and sulfides of cosmetic and pharmaceutical relevance were prepared, including propiophenone, benzophenone, and diphenyl sulfide. The approach is also amenable to sophisticated upcycling reaction designs and can produce desired products stepwise. The facile and versatile approach will provide a scalable and profitable methodology for upcycling PS waste into value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of d&#8208;Band Centers in Localized CdS Homojunctions through Facet Control for Improved Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accelerated kinetic behaviour of charge carrier transfer and its unhindered surface reaction dynamic process involving oxygenated&#8208;intermediate activation and conversion are urgently required in photocatalytic water (H2O) overall splitting, which has not been nevertheless resolved yet. Herein, localized CdS homojunctions with optimal collocation of high and low index facets to regulate d&#8208;band center for chemically adsorbing and activating key intermediates (*&#8208;OH and *&#8208;O) have been achieved in H2O overall splitting into hydrogen. Density functional theory, hall effect, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy confirm that, electrons and holes are kinetically transferred to reductive high index facet (002) and oxidative low index facet (110) of the localized CdS homojunction induced by facet Fermi level difference to dehydrogenate *&#8208;OH and couple *&#8208;O for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively, along with a solar conversion into hydrogen (STH) of 2.20% by Air Mass 1.5 Global filter irradiation. These findings contribute to solving the kinetic bottleneck issues of photocatalytic H2O splitting, which will further enhance STH.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach for the Synthesis of Natural and Artificial Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many terpenoids with isoprene unit(s) demonstrating critical biological activities have been isolated and characterized. Although there are natural and many artificial methods for their syntheses, there is a great demand for better understanding of the corresponding structure&#8208;activity relationship, efficiency, and diversity. In this work, we have developed a robust chem&#8208;stamp strategy for the construction of the key isoprene unit, which consists of two steps: one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to the alkenyl boronates and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols yielding enals. This chem&#8208;stamp could easily be applied repeatedly and separately, empowering the modular concise syntheses of many natural and pharmaceutically active terpenoids including retinal, &#946;&#8208;carotene, vitamin A, tretinoin, fenretinide, acitretin, ALRT1550, nigerapyrone C, peretinoin, and lycopene. Due to the diversified availability of the starting materials, aldehydes and 2,3&#8208;allenols, creation of new non&#8208;natural terpenoids has been realized from four dimensions: the number of isoprene units, side chain, and two terminal groups.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Metabolic Imaging of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate&#8208;d3 Hyperpolarized By Reversible Exchange With Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non&#8208;invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 for injection in 6 minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non&#8208;toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30 mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11% (residual 250 mM methanol and 20 &#181;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Devising energy&#8208;efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis&#8208;polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (~98%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG&#8208;based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed&#8208;loop recycling characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Pressure Carbonylation of Benzyl Carbonates and Carbamates for Applications in 13C Isotope Labeling and Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a methodology to access isotopically labeled esters and amides from carbonates and carbamates employing an oxygen deletion strategy. This methodology utilizes a decarboxylative carbonylation approach for isotope labeling with near stoichiometric, ex situ generated 12C, or 13C carbon monoxide. This reaction is characterized by its broad scope, functional group tolerance, and high yields, which is showcased with the synthesis of structurally complex molecules. A complementary method that operates by the catalytic in situ generation of CO via the reduction of CO2 liberated during decarboxylation has also been developed as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach that CO2&#8208;derived compounds can be converted to CO&#8208;containing frameworks. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the catalytic steps which highlight the impact of ligand choice to overcome challenges associated with low&#8208;pressure carbonylation methodologies, along with rational for the development of future methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Trimming Crystallizable Fragment (Fc) Glycans Enables the Direct Enzymatic Transfer of Biomacromolecules to Antibodies as Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoengineering has provided powerful tools to construct site&#8208;specific antibody conjugates. However, only small&#8208;molecule payloads can be directly transferred to native or engineered antibodies using existing glycoengineering strategies. Herein, we demonstrate that reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment (Fc) glycan could dramatically boost the chemoenzymatic modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) via an engineered fucosyltransferase. In this platform, antibodies with Fc glycans engineered to a simple N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) disaccharide are successfully conjugated to biomacromolecules, such as oligonucleotides and nanobodies, in a single step within hours. Accordingly, we synthesized an antibody&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ cluster of differentiation (CD) 3 bispecific antibody and used it to selectively destroy patient&#8208;derived cancer organoids by reactivating endogenous T lymphocyte cells (T cells) inside the organoid. Our results highlight that this platform is a general approach to construct antibody&#8208;biomacromolecule conjugates with translational values.</dc:description>

         <title>A Broad Light&#8208;Harvesting Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Enables Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in a Bacterial Biohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a rationally designed membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), namely&#160;COE&#8208;IC, which&#160;endows&#160;aerobic N2&#8208;fixing bacteriaAzotobacter vinelandii&#160;with a light&#8208;harvesting ability that enables photosynthetic&#160;ammonia production.&#160;COE&#8208;IC&#160;possesses an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) type conjugated core, which promotes visible light absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore,&#160;COE&#8208;IC&#160;spontaneously associates with&#160;A. vinelandii&#160;to form a biohybrid in which the COE is intercalated within the lipid bilayer membrane. In the presence of L&#8208;ascorbate as a sacrificial electron donor, the resulting&#160;COE&#8208;IC/A. vinelandii&#160;biohybrid showed a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in light&#8208;driven ammonia production, as compared to the control. Photoinduced enhancement of bacterial biomass and production of L&#8208;amino acids is also observed. Introduction&#160;of isotopically enriched&#160;15N2&#160;atmosphere led to the enrichment of&#160;15N&#8208;containing&#160;intracellular metabolites, consistent with the products being generated from&#160;atmospheric N2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane Tension&#8208;Responsive Mechanosensitive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane curvature reflects physical forces operating on the lipid membrane, which plays important roles in cellular processes. Here, we design a mechanosensitive DNA (MSD) nanomachine that mimics natural mechanosensitive PIEZO channels to convert the membrane tension changes of lipid vesicles with different sizes into fluorescence signals in real time. The MSD nanomachine consists of an archetypical six&#8208;helix&#8208;bundle DNA nanopore, cholesterol&#8208;based membrane anchors, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, spiropyran (SP). We find that the DNA nanopore effectively amplifies subtle variations of the membrane tension, which effectively induces the isomerization of weakly emissive SP into highly emissive merocyanine isomers for visualizing membrane tension changes. By measuring the membrane tension via the fluorescence of MSD nanomachine, we establish the correlation between the membrane tension and the curvature that follows the Young&#8208;Laplace equation. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;enabled strategy opens new routes to studying membrane mechanics in physiological and pathological settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomerized Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted wide research attention in the past decades. Very recently, oligomerized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (OFREAs) have emerged as a promising alternative to small&#8208;molecular/polymeric acceptor&#8208;based OSCs due to their unique advantages such as well&#8208;defined structures, batch reproducibility, good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability. So far, rapid advances have been made in the development of OFREAs consisting of directly/rigidly/flexibly linked oligomers and fused ones. In this minireview, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of OFREAs, including structural diversity, synthesis approach,&#160;&#160;molecular conformation and packing, and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, we conclude with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this review will encourage the development of novel OFREAs for OSC applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free Molecular Motif Based on Symmetric Bird&#8208;like Structured Tetraphenylenes with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) Afterglow over 8&#8201;s</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) afterglow of&gt;8&#8197;s without heavy atoms is realized in the rigid twisted structure TeP&#8722;F. The properly promoted electron&#8208;exchange with adequate spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhancement and the restricted molecular motions jointly give rise to the slow but efficient RTP emission, which is of great advantage over the heavy&#8208;atom RTP materials.







Abstract
In recent years, pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with highly efficient and long&#8208;persistent afterglow has drawn substantial awareness. Commonly, spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be improved by introducing heavy atoms into pure&#8208;organic molecules. However, this strategy will simultaneously increase the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition rate, further resulting in dramatic decreases in the excited state lifetime and afterglow duration. Here in this work, a highly symmetric bird&#8208;like structure tetraphenylene (TeP), and its three symmetrical halogenated derivatives (TeP&#8722;F, TeP&#8722;Cl and TeP&#8722;Br) are synthesized, while their RTP properties and mechanisms are systematically investigated by both theoretical and experimental approaches. As the results, the rigid, highly twisted conformation of TeP restricts the non&#8208;radiative processes of RTP and gives rise to the enhancement of electron&#8208;exchange, which can contribute to the RTP radiation process. Despite the faint RTP of the bromine and chlorine&#8208;substituted ones (TeP&#8722;Br, TeP&#8722;Cl), the fluoro&#8208;substituted TeP&#8722;F exhibited a long phosphorescent lifetime up to 890&#8197;ms, corresponding to an extremely long RTP afterglow over 8&#8197;s, which could be incorporated into the best series of non&#8208;heavy&#8208;atom RTP materials reported in previous literature.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed FeN2P2 Motif with High Activity and Stability for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Over the Entire pH Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst with Fe&#8722;N2P2 coordination motif shows outstanding oxygen reduction activity and stability over the whole pH range. The study provides atomic&#8208;level insight into improving the activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts.	







Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the great potential of Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis in catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it remains a grand challenge to substantially improve their intrinsic activity and long&#8208;term stability in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy, by which high&#8208;density Fe atoms (3.97&#8197;wt%) are coordinated with square&#8208;planar para&#8208;positioned nitrogen and phosphorus atoms in a hierarchical carbon framework. The as&#8208;crafted atomically dispersed Fe catalyst (denoted Fe&#8208;SA/PNC) manifests an outstanding activity towards ORR over the entire pH range. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V, 0.83&#8197;V, and 0.86&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) are attained in alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes, respectively, representing the high performance among reported catalysts to date. Furthermore, after 30,000 durability cycles, the Fe&#8208;SA/PNC remains to be stable with no visible performance decay when tested in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, and only a minor negative shift of 40&#8197;mV detected in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C counterpart. The coordination motif of Fe&#8208;SA/PNC is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides atomic&#8208;level insight into improving the activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts, opening up an avenue to craft the desired single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling (eXEC) Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (eXEC) has emerged as a practical, green, sustainable, efficient electrochemical and controllable approach for constructing C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bonds through selective cross&#8208;coupling of different electrophiles. This Mini&#8208;review summarizes the recent protocols of electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions.







Abstract
Electrochemistry utilizes electrons as a potent, controllable, and traceless alternative to chemical oxidants or reductants, and typically offers a more sustainable option for achieving selective organic synthesis. Recently, the merger of electrochemistry with readily available electrophiles has been recognized as a viable and increasingly popular methodology for efficiently constructing challenging C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds in a sustainable manner for complex organic molecules. In this mini&#8208;review, we have systematically summarized the most recent advances in electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (eXEC) reactions during the last decade. Our focus has been on readily available electrophiles, including aryl and alkyl organic (pseudo)halides, as well as small molecules such as CO2, SO2, and D2O.

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Migratory Allylation of Remote Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective migratory allylation of remote dienes via palladium&#8208;catalyzed simultaneous/directed chain walking is reported. The transformation provides a potential route to achieving stereoselective functionalization of multiple continuous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Chain walking has been an efficient route to realize the functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, but this strategy is limited to mono&#8208;olefin migration and functionalization. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of tandem directed simultaneous migrations of remote olefins and stereoselective allylation for the first time. The adoption of palladium hydride catalysis and secondary amine morpholine as solvent is critical for achieving high substrate compatibility and stereochemical control with this method. The protocol is also applicable to the functionalization of three vicinal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and thus construct three continuous stereocenters along a propylidene moiety via a short synthetic process. Preliminary mechanistic experiments corroborated the design of simultaneous walking of remote dienes.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Z&#8208;Scheme TiO2@MoS2@NC Multi&#8208;Heterostructures for Photo&#8208;Driving Ultrafast Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized novel TiO2@MoS2@NC multi&#8208;heterostructure with photoelectric conversion and electronic transfer interfaces as a dual&#8208;functional photoelectrode for ultrafast sodium ion storage. Benefitting from the unique multi&#8208;heterostructures and superstructural toughness, it showed excellent electrochemical performance and rapid kinetics in half/full sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), as well as massive potential in photo&#8208;SIBs.







Abstract
Exploiting dual&#8208;functional photoelectrodes to harvest and store solar energy is a challenging but efficient way for achieving renewable energy utilization. Herein, multi&#8208;heterostructures consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon coated MoS2 nanosheets supported by tubular TiO2 with photoelectric conversion and electronic transfer interfaces are designed. When a photo sodium ion battery (photo&#8208;SIB) is assembled based on the heterostructures, its capacity increases to 399.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high photo&#8208;conversion efficiency of 0.71&#8201;% switching from dark to visible light at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Remarkably, the photo&#8208;SIB can be recharged by light only, with a striking capacity of 231.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that the proposed multi&#8208;heterostructures can enhance charge transfer kinetics, maintain structural stability, and facilitate the separation of photo&#8208;excited carriers. This work presents a new strategy to design dual&#8208;functional photoelectrodes for efficient use of solar energy.

         <title>Water Self&#8208;Dissociation is Insensitive to Nanoscale Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio molecular simulations reveal that the free&#8208;energy barrier for water dissociation in nanoscopic domains, for instance a pore of 1.6&#8197;nm or a cluster of twelve water molecules, is the same as in the bulk solution. A rise in the barrier is only seen for subnanometer confinement, when the first solvation shell of the hydroxide and hydronium ions is affected.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement effects on water dissociation and reactivity remain controversial, despite their importance to understand the aqueous chemistry at interfaces, pores, or aerosols. The pKw in confined environments has been assessed from experiments and simulations in a few specific cases, leading to dissimilar conclusions. Here, with the use of carefully designed ab initio simulations, we demonstrate that the energetics of bulk water dissociation is conserved intact to unexpectedly small length&#8208;scales, down to aggregates of only a dozen molecules or pores of widths below 2&#8197;nm. The reason is that most of the free&#8208;energy involved in water autoionization comes from breaking the O&#8722;H covalent bond, which has a comparable barrier in the bulk liquid, in a small droplet of nanometer size, or in a nanopore in the absence of strong interfacial interactions. Thus, dissociation free&#8208;energy profiles in nanoscopic aggregates or in 2D slabs of 1&#8197;nm width reproduce the behavior corresponding to the bulk liquid, regardless of whether the corresponding nanophase is delimited by a solid or a gas interface. The present work provides a definite and fundamental description of the mechanism and thermodynamics of water dissociation at different scales with broader implications on reactivity and self&#8208;ionization at the air&#8208;liquid interface.

         <title>Single&#8208;atom Iron Catalyst with Biomimetic Active Center to Accelerate Proton Spillover for Medical&#8208;level Electrosynthesis of H2O2 Disinfectant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed iron catalyst with asymmetrical FeN3S1 moiety is developed to promote proton spillover kinetics toward medical&#8208;level electrosynthesis of H2O2 disinfectant.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of H2O2 has great potential for directly converting O2 into disinfectant, yet it is still a big challenge to develop effective electrocatalysts for medical&#8208;level H2O2 production. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of electrocatalysts with biomimetic active centers, consisting of single atomic iron asymmetrically coordinated with both nitrogen and sulfur, dispersed on hierarchically porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NS/C). The newly&#8208;developed FeSA&#8208;NS/C catalyst exhibited a high catalytic activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction to produce H2O2 at a high current of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a record high H2O2 selectivity of 90&#8201;%. An accumulated H2O2 concentration of 5.8&#8197;wt.% is obtained for the electrocatalysis process, which is sufficient for medical disinfection. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations verified the rationally&#8208;designed catalytic active center with the atomic Fe site stabilized by three&#8208;coordinated nitrogen atoms and one&#8208;sulfur atom (Fe&#8208;N3S&#8208;C). It was further found that the replacement of one N atom with S atom in the classical Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;C active center could induce an asymmetric charge distribution over N atoms surrounding the Fe reactive center to accelerate proton spillover for a rapid formation of the OOH* intermediate, thus speeding up the whole reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Nanopipettes for the Capture and Dynamic Analysis of a Single Mitochondrion inside One Living Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified nanopipette was designed to capture one target mitochondrion labeled with an azide&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (TPP&#8208;N3) via a click reaction at the nanopipette tip between DBCO and TPP&#8208;N3. The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the captured mitochondrion can thus be dynamically monitored, without interference by species present in the cytosol.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of single cells requires the dynamically molecular information in one particular nanometer&#8208;sized organelle in a living cell, which is difficult to achieve using current methods. Due to high efficiency of click chemistry, a new nanoelectrode&#8208;based pipette architecture with dibenzocyclooctyne at the tip is designed to realize fast conjugation with azide group&#8208;containing triphenylphosphine, which targets mitochondrial membranes. The covalent binding of one mitochondrion at the tip of the nanopipette allows a small region of the membrane to be isolated on the Pt surface inside the nanopipette. Therefore, the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the mitochondrion is monitored, which is not interfered by the species present in the cytosol. The dynamic tracking of ROS release from one mitochondrion reveals the distinctive &#8220;ROS&#8208;induced ROS release&#8221; within the mitochondria. Further study of RSL3&#8208;induced ferroptosis using nanopipettes provides direct evidence for supporting the noninvolvement of glutathione peroxidase 4 in the mitochondria during RSL3&#8208;induced ROS generation, which has not previously been observed at the single&#8208;mitochondrion level. Eventually, this established strategy should overcome the existing challenge of the dynamic measurement of one special organelle in the complicated intracellular environment, which opens a new direction for electroanalysis in subcellular analysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Ferrocene 1,3&#8208;Derivatives by Distal C&#8722;H Activation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although transition&#8208;metal catalysis has evolved as a powerful catalysis platform, its application in distal C&#8722;H functionalization of ferrocenes had not been addressed until recently. Here, a PdII/ mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid ligand&#8208;catalyzed distal C(3)&#8722;H functionalization of ferrocenes has been shown with the help of a removable directing group while going through a ferrocene appended 12&#8208;membered cyclic transition state.







Abstract
The third position of cyclopentadienyl ring of a monosubstituted ferrocene has remained as an inaccessible chemical space for direct functionalization. Until recently, functionalizing the C(3)&#8208;position while bypassing the predominantly active C(2)&#8208;position is the most challenging task. Herein, we report a distal C&#8722;H functionalization of monosubstituted ferrocenes using an easily removable directing group with precise site&#8208;selectivity, under a PdII/ mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino&#8208;acid ligand catalytic system. The robust synthetic protocol leads to the synthesis of ferrocene 1,3&#8208;derivatives with broad scope in olefins while functionalizing ferrocenyl methylamine in moderate to good yields via a highly strained ferrocene appended 12&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.

         <title>Low Catalyst Loading Enhances Charge Accumulation for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation requires consecutive accumulation of charges at the catalytically active site. The active centers compete with each other in accumulating charges. The unexpected benefits of low&#8208;density catalyst loading in facilitating forward charge transfer for desired chemical reactions were revealed. It is implied that for practical solar water splitting devices, a suitable catalyst loading is important for optimized performance.







Abstract
Solar water oxidation is a critical step in artificial photosynthesis. Successful completion of the process requires four holes and releases four protons. It depends on the consecutive accumulation of charges at the active site. While recent research has shown an obvious dependence of the reaction kinetics on the hole concentrations on the surface of heterogeneous (photo)electrodes, little is known about how the catalyst density impacts the reaction rate. Using atomically dispersed Ir catalysts on hematite, we report a study on how the interplay between the catalyst density and the surface hole concentration influences the reaction kinetics. At low photon flux, where surface hole concentrations are low, faster charge transfer was observed on photoelectrodes with low catalyst density compared to high catalyst density; at high photon flux and high applied potentials, where surface hole concentrations are moderate or high, slower surface charge recombination was afforded by low&#8208;density catalysts. The results support that charge transfer between the light absorber and the catalyst is reversible; they reveal the unexpected benefits of low&#8208;density catalyst loading in facilitating forward charge transfer for desired chemical reactions. It is implied that for practical solar water splitting devices, a suitable catalyst loading is important for maximized performance.

The results support that charge transfer between the light absorber and the catalyst is reversible; they reveal the unexpected benefits of low-density catalyst loading in facilitating forward charge transfer for desired chemical reactions. It is implied that for practical solar water splitting devices, a suitable catalyst loading is important for maximized performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications of Helical &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers Derived from a Thioether&#8208;Containing Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#946;&#8208;peptides containing cyclic thioether side chains adopted a 12&#8208;helical conformation, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR, and circular dichroism. Post&#8208;synthetic modifications, such as oxidation, desulfurization, and notably chemoselective conjugation, highlighted the unique potential of the methionine&#8208;like building block for diverse applications in peptidomimetic systems.







Abstract
We introduce a novel cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC), as a versatile building block for designing peptide foldamers with controlled secondary structures. We synthesized and characterized a series of &#946;&#8208;peptide hexamers containing ATTC using various techniques, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that ATTC&#8208;containing foldamers can adopt 12&#8208;helical conformations similar to their isosteres and offer the possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their properties via post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In particular, chemoselective conjugation strategies demonstrate that ATTC provides unique post&#8208;synthetic modification opportunities, which expand their potential applications across diverse research areas. Collectively, our study highlights the versatility and utility of ATTC as an alternative to previously reported cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks in both structural and functional aspects, paving the way for future research in the realm of peptide foldamers and beyond.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of the Oxidative Addition as a Way To Improve the Catalytic Efficiency of Pincer&#8208;Rhodium (I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular association of coronene and a pincer RhI complex of formula [Rh(CNC)(CO)]+ increases the electron&#8208;donating character of the pincer ligand. This results in a strong benefit to the catalytic performance of the complex towards the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid.







Abstract
1H NMR studies using a cationic complex with a pyridine&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene pincer ligand of formula [Rh(CNC)(CO)]+ revealed that this compound showed high binding affinity with coronene in CH2Cl2. The interaction between coronene and the planar RhI complex is established by means of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. This interaction has a strong impact on the electron&#8208;donating strength of the pincer CNC ligand, which is increased significantly, as demonstrated by the shifting of the &#957;(CO) stretching bands to lower frequencies. The addition of coronene increases the reaction rate of the nucleophilic attack of methyl iodide on the rhodium (I) pincer complex, and also has a positive effect on the performance of the complex as a catalyst in the cycloisomerization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. These findings highlight the importance of supramolecular interactions for tuning the reactivity and catalytic activity of square&#8208;planar metal complexes.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Reprogramming of Macrophages by Chiral Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanozymes were used as extracellularly localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generators to reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) by harnessing their chirality&#8208;dependent interactions with biological systems for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
It is known that extracellular free radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) rather than intracellular ROS plays a non&#8208;substitutable role in regulation of tumor&#8208;suppressing (M1) tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization. However, most therapeutic nanoplatforms mainly provide intracellular ROS and exhibit insufficient accumulation near TAMs, which strongly limits the macrophage&#8208;based immunotherapeutic effects. Here we design and synthesize chiral MoS2/CoS2 nanozymes with peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities to efficiently modulate TAMs polarization and reverse tumor immunosuppression by harnessing their chirality&#8208;specific interactions with biological systems. MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles coordinated with d&#8208;chirality (d&#8208;NPs, right&#8208;handed) show improved pharmacokinetics with longer circulating half&#8208;life and higher tumor accumulation compared with their l (left&#8208;handed)&#8208; and dl (racemate)&#8208;counterparts. Further, d&#8208;NPs can escape from macrophage uptake in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with the aid of cell&#8208;unpreferred opposite chirality and act as extracellular hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and oxygen (O2) generators to efficiently repolarize TAMs into M1 phenotype. On the contrary, l&#8208;NPs showed high cellular uptake due to chirality&#8208;driven homologous adhesion between l&#8208;NPs and macrophage membrane, leading to limited M1 polarization performance. As the first example for developing chiral nanozymes as extracellular&#8208;localized ROS generators to reprogram TAMs for cancer immunotherapy, this study opens an avenue for applications of chiral nanozymes in immunomodulation.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Assisted Ball Assembly for Solvent&#8208;Processing the C60 Electron Transport Layer of High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bowl (corannulene)&#8208;assisted ball (fullerene) assembly strategy for solution&#8208;processing the favorable C60 electron transport layer (ETL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was deliberately proposed, delivering a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.7&#8201;% with an excellent light&#8208;soaking stability of 1000&#8197;hours, which highlights the great potential of corannulene in solubilizing and stabilizing C60 for efficient and stable PSCs.







Abstract
Pristine fullerene C60 is an excellent electron transport material for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inverted structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but its low solubility leaves thermal evaporation as the only method for depositing it into a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL). To address this problem, we herein introduce a highly soluble bowl&#8208;shaped additive, corannulene, to assist in C60&#8208;assembly into a smooth and compact film through the favorable bowl&#8208;ball interaction. Our results show that not only corannulene can dramatically enhance the film formability of C60, it also plays a critical role in forming C60&#8208;corannulene (CC) supramolecular species and in boosting intermolecular electron transport dynamics in the ETL. This strategy has allowed CC devices to deliver high power conversion efficiencies up to 21.69&#8201;%, which is the highest value among the PSCs based on the solution&#8208;processed&#8208;C60 (SP&#8208;C60) ETL. Moreover, the stability of the CC device is far superior to that of the C60&#8208;only device because corannulene can retard and curb the spontaneous aggregation of C60. This work establishes the bowl&#8208;assisted ball assembly strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient SP&#8208;C60 ETLs with high promise for fully&#8208;SP PSCs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Nonpolar C&#8722;C Bonds via &#960;&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Enabled Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed aromatization reaction of cyclohexadienol silyl ethers, which were readily prepared from cyclohexenones. The reaction was achieved through a cascade approach involving &#960;&#8208;coordination&#8208;enabled allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3)/C(sp2) bond cleavage. The generality of this strategy was shown by reacting a large array of cyclohexadienol ethers, including bicyclic&#8208; and spiro&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
Activation of C&#8722;C bonds allows editing of molecular skeletons, but methods for selective activation of nonpolar C&#8722;C bonds in the absence of a chelation effect or a driving force derived from opening of a strained ring are scarce. Herein, we report a method for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed activation of nonpolar C&#8722;C bonds of pro&#8208;aromatic compounds by means of &#960;&#8208;coordination&#8208;enabled aromatization. This method was effective for cleavage of C&#8722;C(alkyl) and C&#8722;C(aryl) bonds and for ring&#8208;opening of spirocyclic compounds, providing an array of benzene&#8208;ring&#8208;containing products. The isolation of a methyl ruthenium complex intermediate supports a mechanism involving ruthenium&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Electrophiles with Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron catalyst achieves cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles wherein olefins, in the presence of a hydrosilane, are used in place of alkylmetal reagents to form alkyl&#8211;alkyl bonds. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of an alkyl radical from the alkyl electrophile, as well as with reversibility for some of the elementary steps that precede carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation.







Abstract
In terms of its abundance and its minimal toxicity, iron has advantages relative to other transition metals. Although alkyl&#8211;alkyl bond construction is central to organic synthesis, examples of iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl couplings of alkyl electrophiles are relatively sparse. Herein we report an iron catalyst that achieves cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles wherein olefins, in the presence of a hydrosilane, are used in place of alkylmetal reagents. Carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation proceeds at room temperature, and the method employs commercially available components (Fe(OAc)2, Xantphos, and Mg(OEt)2); interestingly, this set of reagents can be applied directly to a distinct hydrofunctionalization of olefins, hydroboration. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of an alkyl radical from the alkyl electrophile, as well as with reversibility for elementary steps that precede carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation (olefin binding to iron and &#946;&#8208;migratory insertion).

         <title>Triazinium Ligation: Bioorthogonal Reaction of N1&#8208;Alkyl 1,2,4&#8208;Triazinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of reagents that can selectively react in complex biological media is an important challenge. Here we show that N1&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines yields the corresponding triazinium salts, which are three orders of magnitude more reactive in reactions with strained alkynes than the parent 1,2,4&#8208;triazines. This powerful bioorthogonal ligation enables efficient modification of peptides and proteins. The positively charged N1&#8208;alkyl triazinium salts exhibit favorable cell permeability, which makes them superior for intracellular fluorescent labeling applications when compared to analogous 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Due to their high reactivity, stability, synthetic accessibility and improved water solubility, the new ionic heterodienes represent a valuable addition to the repertoire of existing modern bioorthogonal reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Control of Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light Transparency Based on Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Association of Tetrathiafulvalene Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The light&#8208;transmissive properties of a solid&#8208;state tetrathiafulvalene radical cation&#8211;bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 1&#8208;C5&#8226;+&#8226;NTf2&#8211;, underwent instantaneous changes in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region (1000&#8211;2500 nm) due to upon exposure to solvent vapor or the application of mechanostress at room temperature. The initial solid state of 1&#8208;C5&#8226;+&#8226;NTf2&#8211; exhibited strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR; 700&#8211;1000 nm) and SWIR regions, whereas the absorption in the SWIR region was significantly diminished in the stimulated state induced by dichloromethane vapor. Upon cessation of vapor stimulation, the solid state spontaneously and promptly reverted to its original state, characterized by absorption bands in the NIR/SWIR region. Moreover, the SWIR absorption was absent upon the application of mechanical stress using a steel spatula. The reversal was fast and occurred within 10 s. These changes were visualized using a SWIR imaging camera under 1450&#8208;nm light irradiation. Experimental investigations demonstrated that the transparency to the SWIR light in the solid states was modulated through significant structural transformations of the associated radical cations, with transitions between columnar and isolated &#960;&#8208;dimer structures under ambient and stimulated conditions, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Active Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Cage for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potential clean method, but the long distance between the oxidation and reduction sites in photocatalysts hinders the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges. Here, a metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst, Co14(L&#8208;CH3)24, is constructed by directly coordinating metal sites (Co sites) used for O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with non&#8208;metallic sites (imidazole sites of ligands) used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR), which shortens the transport path of photogenerated electrons and holes, and improves the transport efficiency of charges and activity of photocatalyst. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for H2O2 production under O2&#8208;saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time, that is, to build a synergistic metal&#8208;nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host&#8208;guest chemistry inherent in MOC to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytic active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triphosphate Pronucleotide (TriPPPro)&#160;Reporter with Optimized Cell&#8208;Permeable Dyes for Metabolic Labeling of Cellular and Viral DNA in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metabolic labeling of nucleic acids in living cells is highly desirable to track the dynamics of nucleic acid metabolism in real&#8208;time and has the potential to provide novel insights into cellular biology as well as pathogen&#8208;host interactions. Catalyst&#8208;free inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions (iEDDA) with nucleosides carrying highly reactive moieties such as axial 2&#8208;trans&#8208;cyclooctene (2TCOa) would be an ideal tool to allow intracellular labeling of DNA. However, cellular kinase phosphorylation of the modified nucleosides is needed after cellular uptake as triphosphates are not membrane permeable. Unfortunately, the narrow substrate window of most endogenous kinases limits the use of highly reactive moieties. Here, we apply our TriPPPro (triphosphate pronucleotide) approach to directly deliver a highly reactive 2TCOa&#8208;modified 2'&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate reporter into living cells. We show that this nucleoside triphosphate is metabolically incorporated into de novo synthesized cellular and viral DNA and can be labeled with highly reactive and cell&#8208;permeable fluorescent dye&#8208;tetrazine conjugates via iEDDA to visualize DNA in living cells directly. Thus, we present the first comprehensive method for live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular and viral nucleic acids using a two&#8208;step labeling approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Alkylureido Imidazole Artificial Water Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature creates aquaporins to effectively transport water, rejecting all ions including protons. Aquaporins (AQPs) has brought inspiration for the development of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). Imidazole&#8208;quartet (I&#8208;quartet) was the first AWC that enabled to self&#8208;assemble a tubular backbone for rapid water and proton permeation with total ion rejection. Here, we report the discovery of bis&#8208;alkylureido imidazole compounds, which outperform the I&#8208;quartets by exhibiting ~3 times higher net and single channel permeabilities (107 H2O/s/channel) and &#160;a ~2&#8208;3 times lower proton conductance. The higher water conductance regime is associated to the high partition of more hydrophobic bis&#8208;alkylureido channels in the membrane and to their pore sizes, experiencing larger fluctuations, leading to an increase in the number of water molecules in the channel, with decreasing H&#8208;bonding connectivity. This new class of AWCs will open new pathways toward scalable membranes with enhanced water transport performances.</dc:description>

         <title>The Crucial Role of Sb2F10 in the Chemical Synthesis of F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The purely chemical synthesis of fluorine is a spectacular reaction which for more than a century had been believed to be impossible. In 1986, it was finally experimentally achieved, but since then this important reaction has not been further studied and its detailed mechanism had been a mystery. The known thermal stability of MnF4 casts serious doubts on the originally proposed hypothesis that MnF4 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to a lower manganese fluoride and F2. This apparent discrepancy has now been resolved experimentally and by electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the reductive elimination of F2 requires a large excess of SbF5 and occurs in the last reaction step when in the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11] the addition of one more SbF5 molecule to the [SbF6]&#8722; anion generates a second tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anion. The two tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anions then provide six fluorine bridges to the Mn(II) cation thereby facilitating the reductive elimination of the two fluorine ligands as F2.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Reduction Cocatalysts: Critical Role of Metal Cocatalysts in Photocatalytic Oxidation of Methane with Water
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The function of metal cocatalysts that act as acceptor sites for photogenerated holes and dominate oxidation reactions was explored in the context of photocatalytic oxidation of CH4 with H2O. Beyond the conventional assumption in photocatalysis that the metal cocatalysts accumulate mostly photogenerated electrons and induce reduction reactions exclusively, they have impacts on the dynamics and selectivity of hole&#8208;driven oxidation of CH4.







Abstract
Environmentally sustainable and selective conversion of methane to valuable chemicals under ambient conditions is pivotal for the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic technology. However, due to the lack of microscopic knowledge about non&#8208;thermal methane conversion, controlling and modulating photocatalytic oxidation processes driven by photogenerated holes remain a challenge. Here, we report novel function of metal cocatalysts to accept photogenerated holes and dominate selectivity of methane oxidation, which is clearly beyond the conventional concept in photocatalysis that the metal cocatalysts loaded on the surfaces of semiconductor photocatalysts mostly capture photogenerated electrons and dominate reduction reactions exclusively. The novel photocatalytic role of metal cocatalysts was verified by operando molecular spectroscopy combined with real&#8208;time mass spectrometry for metal&#8208;loaded Ga2O3 model photocatalysts under methane and water vapor at ambient temperature and pressure. Our concept of metal cocatalysts that work as active sites for both photocatalytic oxidation and reduction provides a new understanding of photocatalysis and a solid basis for controlling non&#8208;thermal redox reactions by metal&#8208;cocatalyst engineering.

         <dc:description>
We disclose a practical method for site&#8208;selective allylic coupling that allows the construction of N&#8208;heteroarenes containing benzylic quaternary and tertiary carbons from a wide variety organodiboron reagents and aryl nitrile electrophiles.

         <title>Modular Oxime Formation by a trans&#8208;AT Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzolactone enamides, a number of which incorporate a methylated oxime moiety, are produced by a range of organisms, and constitute a family of cytotoxic natural products. Here, we determine how this capped oxime group is installed during assembly of the model polyketide lobatamide by a modular trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase and provide molecular insight into the responsible mono&#8208;oxygenase domain by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Modular trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are enzymatic assembly lines that biosynthesize complex polyketide natural products. Relative to their better studied cis&#8208;AT counterparts, the trans&#8208;AT PKSs introduce remarkable chemical diversity into their polyketide products. A notable example is the lobatamide A PKS, which incorporates a methylated oxime. Here we demonstrate biochemically that this functionality is installed on&#8208;line by an unusual oxygenase&#8208;containing bimodule. Furthermore, analysis of the oxygenase crystal structure coupled with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allows us to propose a model for catalysis, as well as identifying key protein&#8208;protein interactions that support this chemistry. Overall, our work adds oxime&#8208;forming machinery to the biomolecular toolbox available for trans&#8208;AT PKS engineering, opening the way to introducing such masked aldehyde functionalities into diverse polyketides.

         <title>Synthetic Peptide Antibodies as TNF&#8208;&#945; Inhibitors: Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels Neutralize the Inflammatory Activity of TNF&#8208;&#945; in THP&#8208;1 Derived Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TNF&#8208;&#945; inhibitors, drugs based on monoclonal antibodies, are currently used to treat inflammatory diseases. Synthetic peptide antibodies based on molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP&#8208;NGs) can be promising alternatives. MIP&#8208;NGs neutralize biologically active TNF&#8208;&#945; secreted in the supernatant of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced human THP&#8208;1 derived macrophages. Consequently, TNF&#8208;&#945; cannot bind to its receptor, suppressing inflammatory responses.







Abstract
Tumor Necrosis Factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) is a cytokine that is normally produced by immune cells when fighting an infection. But, when too much TNF&#8208;&#945; is produced as in autoimmune diseases, this leads to unwanted and persistent inflammation. Anti&#8208;TNF&#8208;&#945; monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the therapy of these disorders by blocking TNF&#8208;&#945; and preventing its binding to TNF&#8208;&#945; receptors, thus suppressing the inflammation. Herein, we propose an alternative in the form of molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP&#8208;NGs). MIP&#8208;NGs are synthetic antibodies obtained by nanomoulding the 3&#8208;dimensional shape and chemical functionalities of a desired target in a synthetic polymer. Using an in&#8208;house developed in silico rational approach, epitope peptides of TNF&#8208;&#945; were generated and &#8216;synthetic peptide antibodies&#8217; were prepared. The resultant MIP&#8208;NGs bind the template peptide and recombinant TNF&#8208;&#945; with high affinity and selectivity, and can block the binding of TNF&#8208;&#945; to its receptor. Consequently they were applied to neutralize pro&#8208;inflammatory TNF&#8208;&#945; in the supernatant of human THP&#8208;1 macrophages, leading to a downregulation of the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. Our results suggest that MIP&#8208;NGs, which are thermally and biochemically more stable and easier to manufacture than antibodies, and cost&#8208;effective, are very promising as next generation TNF&#8208;&#945; inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Synthetic peptide antibodies based on molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP-NGs) can be promising alternatives. MIP-NGs neutralize biologically active TNF-&#945; secreted in the supernatant of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human THP-1 derived macrophages. Consequently, TNF-&#945; cannot bind to its receptor, suppressing inflammatory responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor Necrosis Factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) is a cytokine that is normally produced by immune cells when fighting an infection. But, when too much TNF-&#945; is produced as in autoimmune diseases, this leads to unwanted and persistent inflammation. Anti-TNF-&#945; monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the therapy of these disorders by blocking TNF-&#945; and preventing its binding to TNF-&#945; receptors, thus suppressing the inflammation. Herein, we propose an alternative in the form of molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP-NGs). MIP-NGs are synthetic antibodies obtained by nanomoulding the 3-dimensional shape and chemical functionalities of a desired target in a synthetic polymer. Using an in-house developed in silico rational approach, epitope peptides of TNF-&#945; were generated and &#8216;synthetic peptide antibodies&#8217; were prepared. The resultant MIP-NGs bind the template peptide and recombinant TNF-&#945; with high affinity and selectivity, and can block the binding of TNF-&#945; to its receptor. Consequently they were applied to neutralize pro-inflammatory TNF-&#945; in the supernatant of human THP-1 macrophages, leading to a downregulation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our results suggest that MIP-NGs, which are thermally and biochemically more stable and easier to manufacture than antibodies, and cost-effective, are very promising as next generation TNF-&#945; inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation for the Chemical Synthesis of Mirror&#8208;Image Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation (BISIAL) method was described for the synthesis of membrane&#8208;associated D&#8208;proteins. The ligation of split intein&#8208;modified D&#8208;peptides proceeds smoothly at micromolar (&#956;M) concentrations under strongly chaotropic conditions (8.0&#8197;M urea), and the subsequent removal of the backbone modification groups affords the desired D&#8208;proteins without leaving any &#8220;ligation scar&#8221; on the products.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;associated D&#8208;proteins are an important class of synthetic molecules needed for D&#8208;peptide drug discovery, but their chemical synthesis using canonical ligation methods such as native chemical ligation is often hampered by the poor solubility of their constituent peptide segments. Here, we describe a Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation (BISIAL) method for the synthesis of these proteins, wherein the native L&#8208;forms of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;intein fragments of the unique consensus&#8208;fast (Cfa) (i.e. L&#8211;CfaN and L&#8211;CfaC) are separately installed onto the two D&#8208;peptide segments to be ligated via a removable backbone modification. The ligation proceeds smoothly at micromolar (&#956;M) concentrations under strongly chaotropic conditions (8.0&#8197;M urea), and the subsequent removal of the backbone modification groups affords the desired D&#8208;proteins without leaving any &#8220;ligation scar&#8221; on the products. The effectiveness and practicality of the BISIAL method are exemplified by the synthesis of the D&#8208;enantiomers of the extracellular domains of T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC). The BISIAL method further expands the chemical protein synthesis ligation toolkit and provides practical access to challenging D&#8208;protein targets.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Zinc Diazoalkyl Complex: [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined zinc &#945;&#8208;diazoalkyl complex (3) was synthesized for the first time through the dehydrogenation reaction of trimethylsilyldiazomethane (Me3SiCHN2) with either a zinc(I)&#8208;zinc(I) bonded compound or a zinc(II) hydride. Notably, complex 3 selectively undergoes formal [3+2] cycloaddition with CO to generate complex 6 with a 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole core, reflecting an unprecedented CO reaction mode.







Abstract
This work reports the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of the first example of a well&#8208;defined zinc &#945;&#8208;diazoalkyl complex. Treatment of zinc(I)&#8208;zinc(I) bonded compound L2Zn2 [L=CH3C(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)CHC(CH3)(NCH2CH2PPh2)] or zinc(II) hydride LZnH with trimethylsilyldiazomethane affords zinc diazoalkyl complex LZnC(N2)SiMe3. This complex liberates N2 in the presence of a nickel catalyst to form an &#945;&#8208;zincated phosphorus ylide by reacting with the pendant phosphine. It selectively undergoes formal [3+2] cycloaddition with CO2 or CO to form the corresponding product with a five&#8208;membered heterocyclic core. Notably, the use of CO in such a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is unprecedented, reflecting a novel CO reaction mode.

         <title>The Power of Kinetic Inertness in Improving Platinum Anticancer Therapy by Circumventing Resistance and Ameliorating Nephrotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically inert platinum organometallic antitumor agent that is remarkably potent in vivo was designed and synthesized. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, the authors demonstrate the power of kinetic inertness in improving the therapeutic benefits of platinum&#8208;based anticancer chemotherapy by overcoming platinum resistance and ameliorating nephrotoxicity.







Abstract
Even in the modern era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, chemotherapy with platinum (Pt) drugs remains among the most commonly prescribed medications against a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, the broad applicability of these blockbuster Pt drugs is severely limited by intrinsic and/or acquired resistance, and high systemic toxicity. Considering the strong interconnection between kinetic lability and undesired shortcomings of clinical Pt drugs, we rationally designed kinetically inert organometallic Pt based anticancer agents with a novel mechanism of action. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that the development of a remarkably efficacious but kinetically inert Pt anticancer agent is feasible. Along with exerting promising antitumor efficacy in Pt&#8208;sensitive as well as Pt&#8208;resistant tumors in vivo, our best candidate has the ability to mitigate the nephrotoxicity issue associated with cisplatin. In addition to demonstrating, for the first time, the power of kinetic inertness in improving the therapeutic benefits of Pt based anticancer therapy, we describe the detailed mechanism of action of our best kinetically inert antitumor agent. This study will certainly pave the way for designing the next generation of anticancer drugs for effective treatment of various cancers.

         <title>Promoter&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Cyclic Mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclodextrins are widely used as carriers of small molecules for drug delivery due to their remarkable host properties and excellent biocompatibility. However, cyclic oligosaccharides with different sizes and shapes are limited. Cycloglycosylation of ultra&#8208;large bifunctional saccharide precursors is challenging due to the constrained conformational spaces. Here we report a promoter&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach for the synthesis of cyclic &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer. Cycloglycosylation of the bifunctional thioglycosides and (Z)&#8208;ynenoates was found to be highly dependent on the promoters. In particular, sufficient amount of gold(I) complex played a key role in the proper preorganization of the ultra&#8208;large cyclic transition state, providing a cyclic 32&#8208;mer polymannoside, which represents the largest synthetic cyclic polysaccharide to date. NMR experiments and computational study revealed that the cyclic 2&#8208;mer, 4&#8208;mer, 8&#8208;mer, 16&#8208;mer, and 32&#8208;mer mannosides adopted different conformational states and shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Dendritic Hyperbranched Polyacrylates and Their Topological Block Polymers by Organotellurium&#8208;Mediated Emulsion Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical synthesis of structurally controlled hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) by organotellurium&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (TERP) in water under emulsion conditions is reported. Copolymerization of vinyltelluride named evolmer, which induces controlled branch structure, and acrylates with TERP chain transfer agent (CTA) in water afforded HBPs having dendron structure. The molecular weight, dispersity, branch number, and branch length of the HBPs were controlled by changing the amount of CTA, evolmer, and acrylate monomers. HB&#8208;poly(butyl acrylate)s (HBPBAs) with up to the 8th generation having an average of 255 branches were successfully synthesized. As the monomer conversion reached nearly quantitative and the obtained polymer particles were well dispersed in water, the method is highly suitable for synthesizing topological block polymers, block polymers consisting of different topologies. Thus, linear&#8208;block&#8208;HB, HB&#8208;block&#8208;linear, and HB&#8208;block&#8208;HB&#8208;PBAs with the controlled structure were successfully synthesized by adding the second monomer(s) to the macro&#8208;CTA. The intrinsic viscosity of the resulting homo&#8208; and topological block PBAs was systematically controlled by the degree of the branch, the branch length, and the topology. Therefore, the method opens the possibility of obtaining various HBPs with diverse branch structures and tuning the polymer properties by the polymer topology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic enzymes present excellent opportunities for the treatment of human disease, modulation of metabolic pathways and system detoxification. However, current use of enzyme therapy in the clinic is limited as naturally occurring enzymes are seldom optimal for such applications and require substantial improvement by protein engineering. Engineering strategies such as design and directed evolution that have been successfully implemented for industrial biocatalysts can significantly advance the field of therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new&#8208;to&#8208;nature therapeutic activities, high selectivity, and suitability for medical applications. This minireview highlights case studies of how state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging methods in protein engineering are explored for the generation of therapeutic enzymes and discusses gaps and future opportunities in the field of enzyme therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;growing organic materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth of living systems is ubiquitous. Living organisms could continually update their sizes, shapes, and properties to meet various environmental challenges. Such a capability is also demonstrated by emerging self&#8208;growing materials that can incorporate externally&#8208;provided compounds to grow as living organisms. In this minireview, we sum these materials from six aspects. First, we discuss their essential characteristics in the introduction section, then describe the strategies for enabling crosslinked organic materials to self&#8208;grow from nutrient solutions containing polymerizable compounds. The developed examples are concluded into five categories based on their molecular mechanisms in this section. In the third section, we explain the mechanism of mass transport within polymer networks during growth, which is critical to controlling the shape and morphology of the grown products. Afterward, simulation models built to explain the interesting phenomena observed in self&#8208;growing materials are discussed. The development of self&#8208;growing materials is accompanied by various fantastic applications, including tuning material&#8217;s bulk properties, creating texture surfaces, growth&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, 4D printing, self&#8208;growing implants, actuation, self&#8208;growing structural coloration, etc. These examples are summed up in the fifth section. Finally, we discuss the opportunities brought by self&#8208;growing materials and their facing challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Dynamic Bonds&#8208;Driven Integrated Cathode/Polymer Electrolyte for Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as the promising higher&#8208;energy and improved&#8208;safety energy&#8208;storage systems. Nevertheless, the electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial issues due to the limited solid physical contact lead to discontinuous interfacial charge transport and large interfacial resistance, thereby suffering from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, we construct an integrated cathode/polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs under the action of polymer chains exchange and recombination originating from multiple dynamic bonds in our well&#8208;designed dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers (DSICE) molecular structure. The DSICE acts as polymer electrolytes with excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical properties, achieving the ultrathin pure polymer electrolyte thickness (12 &#956;m). Notably, the DSICE also functions as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) cathode binders with enhanced adhesive capability. Such well&#8208;constructed Li|DSICE|LFP&#8208;DSICE cells generate delicate electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interfacial contact at the molecular level, providing continuous Li+ transport pathways and promoting uniform Li+ deposition, further delivering superior long&#8208;term charge/discharge stability (&gt;600 cycles, Coulombic efficiency, &gt;99.8%) and high capacity retention (80% after 400 cycles). More practically, the Li|DSICE|LFP&#8208;DSICE pouch cells show stable electrochemical performance, excellent flexibility and safety under abusive tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking a FeV(O) Intermediate for Water Oxidation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species are appealing in conducting O&#8211;O bond formation for water oxidation reaction. However, their high reactivity poses a great challenge to dissection of their chemical transformations. Herein, we introduce an electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand, 2&#8208;[(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;6&#8208;yl]propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol to stabilize such fleeting intermediates. Advanced spectroscopies and electrochemical studies demonstrate a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species formation in water. Combining kinetic and oxygen isotope labelling experiments and organic reactions indicates that the FeV(O) species is responsible for O&#8211;O bond formation via water nucleophilic attack under the real catalytic water oxidation condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Association of Radical Chemistry with LanD Flavoprotein Activity for C&#8208;Terminal Macrocyclization of a Ribosomal Peptide by Formation of an Unsaturated Thioether Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LanD flavoproteins catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of the C&#8208;terminal Cys residue of a peptide to produce an enethiol. This enethiol is highly reactive and can be coupled with an upstream dehydroamino acid through Michael addition to form S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)&#8208;cysteine, an unsaturated thioether residue known to be characteristic of an array of C&#8208;terminally macrocyclized, ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Based on a two&#8208;stage bioinformatics mining of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) related to C&#8208;terminal Cys processing, we here report that LanD activity can couple radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine chemistry to provide a new unsaturated thioether residue, S&#8208;[2&#8208;aminovinyl]&#8208;3&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;cysteine, by conjugating the resultant enethiol with C&#946;&#160;of the Asn residue in the C&#8208;terminal NxxC motif of a peptide for macrocyclization. This study furthers the appreciation of the variety of PTMs in creating the structure diversity of macrocyclic RiPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Non&#8208;radiative Recombination Energy Losses in Asymmetric Acceptors based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) is one key to boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells. Although the recent studies have indicated that the Y&#8208;series asymmetric acceptors&#8208;based devices featured relative low &#916;E3, the understanding of the energy loss mechanism derived from molecular structure change is still lagging behind. Herein, two asymmetric acceptors named BTP&#8208;Cl and BTP&#8208;2Cl with different terminals were synthesized to make a clear comparative study with the symmetric acceptor BTP&#8208;0Cl. Our results suggest that asymmetric acceptors exhibit a larger difference of electrostatic potential (ESP) in terminals and semi&#8208;molecular dipole moment, which contributes to form a stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. Besides, the experimental and theoretical studies reveal that a lower ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular interaction can reduce the distribution of PM6 near the interface to enhance the built&#8208;in potential and decrease the charge transfer state ratio for asymmetric acceptors. Therefore, the devices achieve a higher exciton dissociation efficiency and lower &#916;E3. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and provides a new perspective to understand the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art asymmetric acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway Control of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Supramolecular Polymers by Incorporating Donor&#8211;Acceptor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the nanoscale orientation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains challenging due to the complexity of multiple energy landscapes involved in the supramolecular assembly process. In this study, we have developed an effective strategy for programming the pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated supramolecular polymers, by incorporating both electron&#8208;rich methoxy&#8208; or methanthiol&#8208;benzene as donor unit and electron&#8208;poor cyano&#8208;vinylenes as acceptor units on the monomeric structure. It leads to the formation of parallel&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the metastable species through homomeric donor/acceptor packing, which convert to slip&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the thermodynamically stable species facilitated by heteromeric donor&#8211;acceptor packing. By further investigating the external seed&#8208;induced kinetic&#8208;to&#8208;thermodynamic transformation behaviors, our findings suggest that the donor&#8211;acceptor functionality on the seed structure is crucial for accelerating pathway conversion. This is achieved by eliminating the initial lag phase in the supramolecular polymerization process. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into designing molecular structures that control aggregation pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quadruple&#8208;Borylated Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitter with para/meta Heteroatomic Patterns for Narrowband Orange&#8208;Red Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hindered by spectral broadening issues with redshifted emission, long&#8208;wavelength (e.g., maxima beyond 570 nm) multiple resonance (MR) emitters with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) below 20 nm remain absent. Herein, by strategically embedding diverse boron (B)/nitrogen (N) atomic pairs into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) skeleton, we propose a hybrid pattern for the construction of a long&#8208;wavelength narrowband MR emitter. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter B4N6&#8208;Me realized orange&#8210;red emission with an extremely small FWHM of 19 nm (energy unit: 70 meV), representing the narrowest FWHM among all reported long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cooperation of the applied para B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N and para B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B/N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N patterns is complementary, which gives rise to both narrowband and redshift characteristics. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing B4N6&#8208;Me achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, e.g., a narrowband orange&#8210;red emission with an FWHM of 27 nm (energy unit: 99 meV), an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8%, and ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE of 28.4% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2). This work provides new insights into the further molecular design and synthesis of long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Ni(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylarylation of Alkenes with Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant in transition metal catalyzed oxidative process is an appealing and challenging task in organic synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylarylation of unactivated alkenes enabled by a &#946;&#8208;diketone ligand with highly efficient and excellent regioselectivity employing molecular oxygen as the oxidant and hydroxyl source. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and incredible heterocycle compatibility, providing a variety of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#947;&#8208;hydroxylamides, &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols, &#947;&#8208;aminoalcohols, and 1,3&#8208;diols in high yields. The synthetic value of this methodology was demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of two bioactive compounds, (&#177;)&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;methoxyl citreochilorol and tea catechin metabolites M4.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Urinary Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Acute Renal Allograft Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) after kidney transplantation associated with reduced graft survival and eventual graft failure is poorly diagnosed in hospitals. Here, we report the development of artificial biomarker probes (AMPros) for sensitive urinalysis of ARAR in murine models. AMPros spontaneously go to the kidneys after systemic administration, specifically react with the prodromal immune biomarkers to activate their near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals to report cell&#8208;mediated rejection, and efficiently undergo renal excretion into urine. Thus, AMPros enable convenient optical urinalysis that detects ARAR prior to histological manifestation of rejection, which is also earlier than current diagnostic methods measuring proinflammatory cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte mRNAs. Due to the high kidney specificity, AMPros&#8208;based urinalysis discriminates allograft rejection against other non&#8208;alloimmune specific diseases, which is unattainable by measurement of serological biomarkers. Such a noninvasive and sensitive urine test holds great promise in continuous monitoring of renal allograft conditions at low resource settings for timely clinical interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Mediated Water Dynamics Enables On&#8208;Demand Transport of Sugar Molecules in Two&#8208;Dimensional Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The constructing of artificial channels with gating functions is an important undertaking for gaining insight into biological process and achieving efficient bionic functions. Typically, controllable transport within such channels relies on either electrostatic or specific interactions between the transporting species and the channel. However, for molecules with weak interactions with the channel, achieving precise gating of the transport remains a significant challenge. In this regard, this study proposes a voltage gating membrane of two&#8208;dimensional channels that selectively transport of neutral molecules glucose with a dimension of 0.60 nm. The permeation of glucose is switched on/off by electrochemically manipulating the water dynamics in the nanochannel. Voltage driven&#8208;intercalation of ion into the two&#8208;dimensional channel causes water to stratify and move closer to the channel walls, thereby resulting in the channel center being emptier for glucose diffusion. Due to the sub&#8208;nanometer size dimension of the channel, selective permeation of glucose over sucrose is also achieved in this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Triplet Metal&#8208;Centered Jahn&#8208;Teller Isomers Determine Temperature&#8208;Dependent Luminescence Lifetimes in [Ru(bpy)3]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the factors that determine luminescence lifetime of transition metal compounds is key for applications in photocatalysis and photodynamic therapy. Here we show that for [Ru(bpy)3]2+, the generally accepted idea that emission lifetimes can be controlled optimizing the energy barrier from the emissive triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) state to the thermally&#8208;activated triplet metalcenter (3MC) state or the energy gap between both states is a misconception. Further, we demonstrate that considering a single relaxation pathway determined from the minimum lowest in energy leads to wrong temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes predictions. Instead, we obtain excellent agreement with experimental temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes when an extended kinetic model that includes all the pathways related to multiple Jahn&#8208;Teller isomers and their effective reaction barriers is employed. These concepts are essential to correctly design other luminescent transition metal complexes with tailored emission lifetimes based on theoretical predictions.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Salts Containing Cationic Al24&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Acetate Clusters from Scalable, Green and Aqueous Synthesis Routes</title>

         <dc:description>
The systematic high&#8208;throughput investigation of the system AlCl3/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O led to the discovery of a series of porous salts from readily available starting materials in high yields. In situ crystallisation studies confirm the rapid formation of the highly crystalline compounds within minutes under mild conditions.







Abstract
The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al24 cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]X4, denoted CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X, with X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, HSO4&#8722;. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]Cl4 in water were established resulting in high yields (&gt;95&#8201;%, 215&#8197;g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H2O capacities with maximum values of up to 930&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 430&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 are observed. The particle size of CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X can be tuned between 140&#8197;nm and 1250&#8197;nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders. The positive surface charge of the particles, allow fast and effective adsorption of anionic dye molecules and adsorption of poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

         <title>Chemical Modification of a Bacterial Siderophore by a Competitor in Dual&#8208;Species Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed investigation of the inter&#8208;species chemical communication between the human pathogens P. aeruginosa and S. aureus revealed that S. aureus converts pyochelin, an important siderophore secreted by P. aeruginosa, to its less potent pyochelin methyl ester (PME). In addition, PME is sensed by P. aeruginosa and affects metabolite expression, indicating a potential role as signaling molecule for both species.







Abstract
Chemical communication between competing bacteria in multi&#8208;species environments often enables both species to adapt and survive, and perhaps even thrive. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are two bacterial pathogens found in natural biofilms, especially in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where recent studies showed that there is often cooperation between the two species, leading to increased disease severity and antibiotic resistance. However, the mechanisms behind this cooperation are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed co&#8208;cultured biofilms in various settings, and we applied untargeted mass spectrometry&#8208;based metabolomics analyses, combined with synthetic validation of candidate compounds. We unexpectedly discovered that S. aureus can convert pyochelin into pyochelin methyl ester, an analogue of pyochelin with reduced affinity for iron (III). This conversion allows S. aureus to coexist more readily with P. aeruginosa and unveils a mechanism underlying the formation of robust dual&#8208;species biofilms.

         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Transfer Events in [Fe4Co4] Cubes via a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Approach: The Impact of Elastic Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cubes were prepared via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. The molecular origins of their distinct (incomplete vs. complete) metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) properties were identified as the presence and absence of the inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl and CH/&#960; interactions. These compete with the cluster&#8208;anion interactions, resulting in the underlying elastic frustration and stopping the complete spin transition in 1.







Abstract
The engineering of intermolecular interaction is challenging but critical for magnetically switchable molecules. Here, we prepared two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cube complexes via the alkynyl&#8208; and alcohol&#8208;functionalized trispyrazoyl capping ligands. The alkynyl&#8208;functionalized complex 1 exhibited a thermally&#8208;induced incomplete metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) behaviour at around 220&#8197;K, while the mixed alkynyl/alcohol&#8208;functionalized cube of 2 showed a complete and abrupt MMET behaviour at 232&#8197;K. Remarkably, both compounds showed a long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;induced metastable state up to 200&#8197;K. The crystallographic study demonstrated that the incomplete transition of 1 was likely due to the possible elastic frustration originating from the competition between the anion&#8208;propagated elastic interactions and inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl &amp; CH&#8208;alkynyl interactions, whereas the latter are eliminated in 2 as a result of the partial substitution by the alcohol&#8208;functionalized ligand. Additionally, the introduction of chemically distinguishable cobalt centers within the cube unit of 2 did not lead to a two&#8208;step but a one&#8208;step transition, possibly because of the strong ferroelastic intramolecular interaction through the cyanide bridges.

         <title>Investigating the Role of Vacancies on the Thermoelectric Properties of EuCuSb&#8208;Eu2ZnSb2 Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermoelectric properties of the EuCuSb&#8208;EuZn0.5Sb solid solution. Vacancies in the planar honeycomb lattice cause a decrease in sound velocity and a sharp increase in point defect scattering, which combine to yield an 80&#8201;% decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as the composition changes from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.







Abstract
AMX compounds with the ZrBeSi structure tolerate a vacancy concentration of up to 50&#8201;% on the M&#8208;site in the planar MX&#8208;layers. Here, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermal and electronic properties across the full EuCu1&#8722;xZn0.5xSb solid solution. The transition from a fully&#8208;occupied honeycomb layer (EuCuSb) to one with a quarter of the atoms missing (EuZn0.5Sb) leads to non&#8208;linear bond expansion in the honeycomb layer, increasing atomic displacement parameters on the M and Sb&#8208;sites, and significant lattice softening. This, combined with a rapid increase in point defect scattering, causes the lattice thermal conductivity to decrease from 3 to 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The effect of vacancies on the electronic properties is more nuanced; we see a small increase in effective mass, large increase in band gap, and decrease in carrier concentration. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as we go from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.

     alt="Investigating the Role of Vacancies on the Thermoelectric Properties of EuCuSb-Eu2ZnSb2 Alloys"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermoelectric properties of the EuCuSb-EuZn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb solid solution. Vacancies in the planar honeycomb lattice cause a decrease in sound velocity and a sharp increase in point defect scattering, which combine to yield an 80&#8201;% decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. Ultimately, the maximum &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as the composition changes from EuCuSb to EuZn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;AMX&lt;/i&gt; compounds with the ZrBeSi structure tolerate a vacancy concentration of up to 50&#8201;% on the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-site in the planar &lt;i&gt;MX&lt;/i&gt;-layers. Here, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermal and electronic properties across the full EuCu&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Sb solid solution. The transition from a fully-occupied honeycomb layer (EuCuSb) to one with a quarter of the atoms missing (EuZn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb) leads to non-linear bond expansion in the honeycomb layer, increasing atomic displacement parameters on the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; and Sb-sites, and significant lattice softening. This, combined with a rapid increase in point defect scattering, causes the lattice thermal conductivity to decrease from 3 to 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;mK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&#8197;K. The effect of vacancies on the electronic properties is more nuanced; we see a small increase in effective mass, large increase in band gap, and decrease in carrier concentration. Ultimately, the maximum &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as we go from EuCuSb to EuZn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Tough Thermoplastic Elastomers by Leveraging Rigid&#8211;Flexible Supramolecular Segment Interplays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative strategy for toughening thermoplastic elastomers without toughness&#8211;strength trade&#8208;off limitations is developed by leveraging the interplays between rigid and flexible supramolecular segments, resulting in the toughest (toughness 1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3) thermoplastic elastomer thus far. This work presents a general design principle for toughening polymer materials by mismatched supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions facilitate the development of tough multifunctional thermoplastic elastomers. However, the fundamental principles that govern supramolecular toughening are barely understood, and the rational design to achieve the desired high toughness remains daunting. Herein, we report a simple and robust method for toughening thermoplastic elastomers by rationally tailoring hard&#8211;soft phase separation structures containing rigid and flexible supramolecular segments. The introduced functional segments with distinct structural rigidities provide mismatched supramolecular interactions to efficiently tune the energy dissipation and bear an external load. The optimal supramolecular elastomer containing aromatic amide and acylsemicarbazide moieties demonstrates a record toughness (1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), extraordinary crack tolerance (fracture energy 282.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), an ultrahigh true stress at break (2.3&#8197;GPa), good elasticity, healing ability, recyclability, and impact resistance. The toughening mechanism is validated by testing various elastomers, confirming the potential for designing and developing super&#8208;tough supramolecular materials with promising applications in aerospace and electronics.

         <title>Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a *H&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction from CO2RR. The findings reveal that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 in Cu&#8208;based catalyst could accelerate water dissociation and tailor *H intermediate coverage, which favors hydrogenation of the *HCCOH to ethanol. This study directs a feasible avenue for mediating *H intermediate coverage and tailoring *H&#8208;involved reduction reaction pathways on an efficient and durable Cu&#8208;based oxide catalyst.







Abstract
The direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products offers a promising pathway for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. However, producing ethanol remains a challenge because of the competitive ethylene formation and hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, we propose an active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction on a layered precursor&#8208;derived CuAl2O4/CuO catalyst. The catalyst delivered a Faradaic efficiency of 70&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products and 41&#8201;% for ethanol at current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibited a continuous 150&#8197;h durability in a flow cell. The intensive spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 could tailor *H intermediate coverage and the elevated *H coverage favors the hydrogenation of the *HCCOH intermediate, accounting for the increased yield of ethanol. This work directs a pathway for enhancing ethanol electroproduction from CO2 reduction by tailoring *H intermediate coverage.

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOFs Confining Zwitterionic Sulfamic Acid as Proton Source and Conducting Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic loading of dual&#8208;functioning zwitterionic sulfamic acid in MOFs leads to proton conductivity of the order of 10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This high conductivity is the result of higher loading of sulfamic acid, which can act as both a proton source due to its acidity and a conducting medium due to its extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability and zwitterion effect.







Abstract
A few metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which typically use strong acids as proton sources, display superprotonic conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1); however, they are rare due to the instability of MOFs in highly acidic conditions. For the first time, we report superprotonic conductivity using a moderately acidic guest, zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA), which is encapsulated in MOF&#8208;808 and MIL&#8208;101. HSA acts not only as a proton source but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium due to its extensive hydrogen bonding ability and zwitterion effect. A new sustained concentration gradient method results in higher HSA encapsulation compared to conventional methods, producing 10HSA@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(bSA)2 and 8HSA@MIL&#8208;101. These MOFs show impressive superprotonic conductivity of 2.47&#215;10&#8722;1 and 3.06&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, respectively, at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity, and maintain stability for 7&#8197;days.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Benzothiophenes at C4 by Activation as their Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiophenes are key structures in materials and medicines and methods for their selective C&#8722;H functionalization are highly prized. Activation of benzothiophenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at C3 as their S&#8208;oxides enables formal C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling with phenols to access C4 arylated benzothiophenes. Computational studies suggest the intermediacy of a &#960;&#8208;complex between the benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation.







Abstract
Benzothiophenes, activated by oxidation to the corresponding S&#8208;oxides, undergo C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H&#8208;type coupling with phenols to give C4 arylation products. While an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C3 of the benzothiophene is important, the process operates without a directing group and a metal catalyst, thus rendering it compatible with sensitive functionalities&#8212;e.g. halides and formyl groups. Quantum chemical calculations suggest a formal stepwise mechanism involving heterolytic cleavage of an aryloxysulfur species to give a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding benzothiophene and a phenoxonium cation. Subsequent addition of the phenoxonium cation to the C4 position of the benzothiophene is favored over the addition to C3; Fukui functions predict that the major regioisomer is formed at the more electron&#8208;rich position between C3 and C4. Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal&#8208;free arylation process.

Subsequent addition of the phenoxonium cation to the C4 position of the benzothiophene is favored over the addition to C3; Fukui functions predict that the major regioisomer is formed at the more electron-rich position between C3 and C4. Varied selective manipulation of the benzothiophene products showcase the synthetic utility of the metal-free arylation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Kinetically Stabilized Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Triangulene Cation: Stable and NIR Fluorescent Diradical Cation with Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated. It is highly stable even in solution under air and has a triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation.







Abstract
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated as the stable diradical with a triplet ground state that exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission. As was the case for a triangulene derivative we previously synthesized, the triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was experimentally confirmed by magnetic measurements. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative is highly stable even in solution under air and exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation. Breaking the alternancy symmetry of triplet alternant hydrocarbon diradicals by a nitrogen cation would therefore be an effective strategy to create stable diradicals possessing magnetic properties similar to the parent hydrocarbons but with different electrochemical and photophysical properties.

         <title>An Aqueous Electrolyte Gated Artificial Synapse with Synaptic Plasticity Selectively Mediated by Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial synapse where non&#8208;relevant biomolecules (urea, lactic acid (LA) and fructose (Fru)) cannot modulate its plasticity, while only relevant biomolecules (glucose) can selectively activate the device and induce long&#8208;term modulation and memory effect. The device works properly in blood serum and shows enhanced synaptic behaviors at high glucose concentrations, suggesting its potential application as artificial neurons in vivo.







Abstract
The emulation of functions and behaviors of biological synapses using electronic devices has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in biomedical interfaces. Despite the achievements, artificial synapses that can be selectively responsive to non&#8208;electroactive biomolecules and directly operate in biological environments are still lacking. Herein, we report an artificial synapse based on organic electrochemical transistors and investigate the selective modulation of its synaptic plasticity by glucose. The enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase results in long&#8208;term modulation of the channel conductance, mimicking selective binding of biomolecules to their receptors and consequent long&#8208;term modulation of the synaptic weight. Moreover, the device shows enhanced synaptic behaviors in the blood serum at a higher glucose concentration, which suggests its potential application in vivo as artificial neurons. This work provides a step towards the fabrication of ANNs with synaptic plasticity selectively mediated by biomolecules for neuro&#8208;prosthetics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Alkoxide Powered Zincation of Fluoroarenes Employing Zinc Bis&#8208;Amide Zn(TMP)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the metalation potential of Zn(TMP)2 the addition of KOtBu enables the activation of its amide groups to promote the regioselective zincation of a range of fluoroarenes forming higher order potassium zincates. This methodology can even be extended to non&#8208;activated arenes toluene and benzene under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Reminiscent of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser superbase recipes, the addition of two molar equivalents of KOtBu to Zn(TMP)2 (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) transforms this mild zinc bis&#8208;amide base to a powerful metalating agent able to perform facile regioselective zincation of a wide range of sensitive fluoroarenes. Structural authentication of the intermediates post Zn&#8722;H exchange demonstrates activation of both TMP groups to form a range of higher order bis&#8208;aryl potassium zincates, isolable as solids and further functionalized in electrophilic interception reactions. Studies assessing the role of KOtBu reveal that the first equivalent undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Zn(TMP)2, enabling kinetic activation of the amide groups; whereas the second equivalent stabilizes the metalated intermediate preventing ligand redistribution. Showcasing its metalating power, this bimetallic KOtBu/Zn(TMP)2 partnership, can effect zincation of toluene and benzene at room temperature.

         <title>Covalently Linked Hexakis(m&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Macrocycles as Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for constructing organic nanotubes with defined lengths was developed by designing and synthesizing macrocycles with a &#946;&#8208;alanine linker. Oligomeric hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) macrocycles with four macrocyclic units as molecular nanotubes can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;s.







Abstract
The construction of nanotubular structures with non&#8208;deformable inner pores is of both fundamental and practical significance. Herein we report a strategy for creating molecular nanotubes with defined lengths. Macrocyclic (MC) units based on shape&#8208;persistent hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (m&#8208;PE) macrocycle MC&#8208;1, which are known to stack into hydrogen&#8208;bonded tubular assemblies, are tethered by oligo(&#946;&#8208;alanine) linkers to give tubular stacks MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 that have two and four MC units, respectively. The covalently linked MC units in MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 undergo face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking through intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions that further results in the helical stacks of these compounds. Oligomer MC&#8208;4 can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;seconds, which is among the longest open durations for synthetic ion channels and indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the self&#8208;assembling channels can be drastically enhanced by reducing the number of molecular components involved. This study demonstrates that covalently tethering shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units is a feasible and reliable approach for building molecular nanotubes that otherwise are difficult to create de novo. The extraordinarily long lifetimes of the ion channels formed by MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 suggest the likelihood of constructing the next&#8208;generation synthetic ion channels with unprecedented stability.

         <title>Dynamic Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Communication Mechanism in Poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s under External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix inversion of chiral poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylenes was induced by a dynamic axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism. It was produced by on/off supramolecular interactions between conformationally rigid chiral pendants and bulky molecules.







Abstract
Helix inversion in chiral dynamic helical polymers is usually achieved by conformational changes at the pendant groups induced through external stimuli. Herein, a different mechanism of helix inversion in poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented, based on the activation/deactivation of supramolecular interactions. We prepared poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s (PAEPAs) in which the pendant groups are conformationally locked chiral allenes. Therefore, their substituents are placed in specific spatial orientations. As a result, the screw sense of a PAEPA is fixed by the allenyl substituent with the optimal size/distance relationship to the backbone. This helical sense command can be surpassed by supramolecular interactions between another substituent on the allene and appropriate external stimuli, such as amines. So, a helix inversion occurs through a novel axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism, opening a new scenario for taming the helices of chiral dynamic helical polymers.

&lt;p&gt;Helix inversion of chiral poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylenes was induced by a dynamic axial-to-helical communication mechanism. It was produced by on/off supramolecular interactions between conformationally rigid chiral pendants and bulky molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helix inversion in chiral dynamic helical polymers is usually achieved by conformational changes at the pendant groups induced through external stimuli. Herein, a different mechanism of helix inversion in poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented, based on the activation/deactivation of supramolecular interactions. We prepared poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s (PAEPAs) in which the pendant groups are conformationally locked chiral allenes. Therefore, their substituents are placed in specific spatial orientations. As a result, the screw sense of a PAEPA is fixed by the allenyl substituent with the optimal size/distance relationship to the backbone. This helical sense command can be surpassed by supramolecular interactions between another substituent on the allene and appropriate external stimuli, such as amines. So, a helix inversion occurs through a novel axial-to-helical communication mechanism, opening a new scenario for taming the helices of chiral dynamic helical polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Customizable Supraparticles Constructed from Catechol&#8208;Terminated Molecular Building Blocks with Controllable Intermolecular Interactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically introducing multiple assembly strategies into the construction of customizable supraparticles based on catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks, conventional supraparticles were endowed with structural and functional customization. This strategy paves a way for building multiscale super&#8208;assembled materials with high degrees of structural complexity and functional diversity.







Abstract
Colloidal supraparticles integrated with multicomponent primary particles come with emerging or synergetic functionalities. However, achieving the functional customization of supraparticles remains a great challenge because of the limited options of building blocks with tailorability and functional extensibility. Herein, we developed a universal approach to construct customizable supraparticles with desired properties from molecular building blocks obtained by the covalent conjugation of catechol groups with a series of orthogonal functional groups. These catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks can assemble into primary particles driven by various intermolecular interactions (i.e. metal&#8208;organic coordination, host&#8211;guest, and hydrophobic interactions), and then further assemble into supraparticles governed by catechol&#8208;mediated interfacial interactions. Our strategy enables the formation of supraparticles with diverse functionalities, such as dual&#8208;pH responsiveness, light&#8208;controllable permeability, and non&#8208;invasive fluorescence labeling of living cells. The ease with which these supraparticles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chemical and physical properties through the choice of metals and orthogonal functional groups used, should enable a variety of applications.

         <title>A Significant Two&#8208;Dimensional Structural Transformation in a Coordination Polymer that Changes Its Electronic and Protonic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D structural transformation with a significant change in the coordination environment within the 2D layer was achieved in a copper&#8208;based coordination polymer in water at room temperature. The transformation led to large changes in the physical properties of the coordination polymers, such as proton conductivity and magnetism.







Abstract
A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D (2D: two&#8208;dimensional) structural transformation accompanying significant bond rearrangement and coordination environment change is demonstrated in a coordination polymer (CP) comprised of copper(II) ions and terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;) ligands for the first time. When immersed in water, a free&#8208;standing membrane of 2D Cu(BDC)(DMF) (Cu&#8208;1; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide) transforms into 2D Cu(BDC)(H2O)2 (Cu&#8208;2) while maintaining its highly oriented layered structure. In the 2D sheet, paddlewheel&#8208;type CuII dimers coordinated with four bidentate BDC ligands in a square&#8208;planar array in Cu&#8208;1 were released to form uniform aqua&#8208;bridged CuII chains, which are cross&#8208;linked with each other by unidentate BDC ligands, in Cu&#8208;2. The present facile approach to implement the 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transformation accompanied by bond rearrangement, which is characteristic of CPs, leads to a marked increase in in&#8208;plane magnetic susceptibility and proton conductivity. In situ experiments in support of theoretical calculations unveiled the energy diagram that governs the unique structural transformation.

         <title>Optimizing Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction via Interfacial Electric Field Modulation: Elevating d&#8208;Band Center in WS2&#8208;WO3 for Enhanced Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 can enhance the adsorption of intermediates by elevating the d&#8208;band center of W, resulting in an accelerated electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) kinetics.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) has emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing green ammonia under ambient conditions. Tungsten (W) is one of the most effective ENRR catalysts. In this reaction, the protonation of intermediates is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). Enhancing the adsorption of intermediates is crucial to increase the protonation of intermediates, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. Herein, we constructed a strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 to elevate the d&#8208;band center of W, thereby strengthening the adsorption of intermediates. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach led to a significantly improved ENRR performance. Specifically, WS2&#8208;WO3 exhibited a high NH3 yield of 62.38&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a promoted faraday efficiency (FE) of 24.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations showed that the strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 upshifted the d&#8208;band center of W towards the Fermi level, leading to enhanced adsorption of &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;NH intermediates on the catalyst surface. This resulted in a significantly promoted reaction rate of the RDS. Overall, our study offers new insights into the relationship between interfacial electric field and d&#8208;band center and provides a promising strategy to enhance the intermediates adsorption during the ENRR process.

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel architecture with FeP nanodots fully embedded in nitrogen doped carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) . Such a structure allows the stress transfer between FeP nanodots and self&#8208;adaptive carbon matrix in sodium storage, which overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), which outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.

         <title>A Concerted Enzymatic and Bioorthogonal Approach for Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Activation of Environment&#8208;Sensitive Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Based Imaging Probes and Photosensitizers</title>

         <dc:description>
A concerted strategy involving enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly to target overexpressed alkaline phosphatases in cancer cells and bioorthogonal reactions for controllable extracellular and intracellular activation of RuII&#8208;based imaging probes and photosensitizers is presented. The emission enhancement, lifetime extension, and (photo)cytotoxicity of the resulting RuII supramolecular assemblies were explored extracellularly and intracellularly.







Abstract
In this article, we report a novel targeting strategy involving the combination of an enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) moiety and a strained cycloalkyne to generate large accumulation of bioorthogonal sites in cancer cells. These bioorthogonal sites can serve as activation triggers in different regions for transition metal&#8208;based probes, which are new ruthenium(II) complexes carrying a tetrazine unit for controllable phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation. Importantly, the environment&#8208;sensitive emission of the complexes can be further enhanced in the hydrophobic regions offered by the large supramolecular assemblies, which is highly advantageous to biological imaging. Additionally, the (photo)cytotoxicity of the large supramolecular assemblies containing the complexes was investigated, and the results illustrate that cellular localization (extracellular and intracellular) imposes a profound impact on the efficiencies of photosensitizers.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Bound Formates are Main Reaction Intermediates during CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Cu/ZrO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different types of formates were observed at the surface of a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst during the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. A Cu&#8208;bound formate representing only about 7&#8201;% of formates exhibited a high reactivity and was the only formate that could account for the production of methanol. The two other surface formates were located on the ZrO2 surface and exhibited significantly lower decomposition rates.







Abstract
Cu/ZrO2 is a promising catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Reaction pathways involving formates or hydroxycarbonyls have been proposed. We show here that three different types of formates can be observed under reaction conditions at 220&#8201;&#176;C and 3&#8197;bar, one being located on metallic Cu and two others being bound to ZrO2. The surface concentrations of formates were determined through calibration curves and their reactivity measured during chemical transient experiments. The Cu&#8208;bound formate represented only about 7&#8201;% of surface formates, but exhibited a higher reactivity and was found to be the only formate that could account for all the production of methanol. Copper is thus not there only to activate H2, but also bears other crucial intermediates. This work reemphasizes that fully quantitative IR analyses and transient methods are required to unravel the role of surface species.

         <title>Supramolecularly Engineered Reporters with Superoxide Anion&#8208;Triggered Chemiluminescence for Early Diagnosis and Efficient Amelioration of Acute Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>

Supramolecularly engineered chemiluminescence reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate, chlorin e6 and superoxide dismutase, are reported. The PCCS reporters were applied for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney injury.







Abstract
We report the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; preparation of kidney injury molecule&#8208;1&#8208;targeting supramolecular chemiluminescence (CL) reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid (PLGA)&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), for early diagnosis and amelioration of acute kidney injury (AKI). In this system, O2&#8901;&#8722;, a biomarker of AKI, triggers the oxidation of CPPO to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanedione and subsequent CL emission via CL resonance energy transfer to Ce6. The L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA stabilizes CPPO and Ce6 via noncovalent interactions, promoting long&#8208;lived CL (half&#8208;lives: &#8776;1000&#8197;s). Transcriptomics analysis shows that PCCS reporters reduce the inflammatory response through glutathione metabolism and inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. The reporters are able to non&#8208;invasively detect AKI at least 12&#8197;h earlier than current assays, and their antioxidant properties allow simultaneous treatment of AKI.

         <title>Unlocking Migratory Insertion in Gold Redox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in the AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle has been reported. It represents important progress within the field of gold redox couple chemistry and in particular in the migratory insertion topic.







Abstract
Exploration of elementary reactions in organometallic catalysis is an important method with which to discover new reactions. In this article, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in gold catalytic cycle. A wide range of structurally diverse alkynyl iodides are good coupling partners in this iodo&#8208;alkynylation transformation. Both aliphatic and aromatic alkynyl iodides can react with benzynes smoothly to afford highly functionalized 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics in moderate to good yields. Its good functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage application of complex molecules demonstrate its synthetic robustness. Studies of the mechanism reveals the feasibility of oxidative addition and the DFT calculations demonstrate the possible migratory insertion of benzyne into AuIII&#8208;carbon bonds in the AuI/AuIII redox catalytic cycle, representing an important step towards an elementary reaction in gold chemistry research.

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of H2O2 and Formate by Co&#8208;Electrolysis of Water and CO2 over Bifunctional Zn/SnO2 Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate was constructed with the bifunctional electrocatalyst Zn/SnO2 nanodots, achieving high selectivities and excellent productivities at large current densities. The role of the Zn dopant was revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and (quasi)&#8208;in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation with cathodic CO2 reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn&#8208;doped SnO2 (Zn/SnO2) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6&#8201;% and 92.2&#8201;% for H2O2 and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60&#8197;h at a current density of &#8776;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/1H NMR and quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H2O2 production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8208;based pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate feedstocks.

&lt;p&gt;An innovative pair-electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formate was constructed with the bifunctional electrocatalyst Zn/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanodots, achieving high selectivities and excellent productivities at large current densities. The role of the Zn dopant was revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and (quasi)-in situ characterizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two-electron water oxidation with cathodic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn-doped SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Zn/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6&#8201;% and 92.2&#8201;% for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60&#8197;h at a current density of &#8776;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and quasi-in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst-based pair-electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formate feedstocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multistate Aggregation&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Properties of Enantiopure Disulfide&#8208;Mediated Bispyrene Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective double thiol&#8208;ene addition onto a bis enol ether macrocycle provides chiral disulfide bispyrene macrocycles able to exhibit excimer aggregation&#8208;induced emission predominantly. Upon increasing the water content, ECD and CPL monitoring evidence multistate chiroptical properties, rationalized by TDDFT calculations. Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films and AFM studies help decipher the organization of the luminophores at the interface of water.







Abstract
A chiral bispyrene macrocycle designed for exclusive intermolecular excimer fluorescence upon aggregation was synthesized by a double hydrothiolation of a bis&#8208;enol ether macrocycle followed by intramolecular oxidation of free thiols. Unusually high stereoselectivity was achieved for the thiol&#8208;ene additions under templated conditions and Et3B/O2 radical initiation. After enantiomer separation (chiral stationary phase HPLC), aqueous conditions provoked aggregation. Detailed structural evolution was afforded by ECD/CPL monitoring. Three regimes can be observed and characterized by strong modifications in chiroptical patterns under, at, or above a 70&#8201;% H2O&#8201;:&#8201;THF threshold. In luminescence, high glum dissymmetry factors values were obtained, up to 0.022, as well as a double sign inversion of CPL signals during the aggregation, a behavior rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Langmuir layers of enantiopure disulfide macrocycles were formed at the air&#8211;water interface and transferred onto solid substrates to afford Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films, which were then studied by AFM and UV/ECD/fluorescence/CPL.

         <title>Probing Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Covalently Linked [Ge9]&#8208;Cluster Imine Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylated [Ge9] clusters form a novel type of chromophore system. Protonation of a covalently cluster&#8208;bound imine moiety results in an intense color change from red to green. Transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations on the protonated form reveal ultrafast dynamics upon photoexcitation leading to a charge&#8208;transfer between the cluster and the imine moiety, thus giving the proof of principle for a cluster&#8208;imine dyad.







Abstract
C60 donor dyads in which the carbon cage is covalently linked to an electron&#8208;donating unit have been discussed as one possibility for an electron&#8208;transfer system, and it has been shown that spherical [Ge9] cluster anions show a close relation to fullerenes with respect to their electronic structure. However, the optical properties of these clusters and of functionalized cluster derivatives are almost unknown. We now report on the synthesis of the intensely red [Ge9] cluster linked to an extended &#960;&#8208;electron system. [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp]&#8722; (1&#8722;) is formed upon the reaction of [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; with bromo&#8208;diazaborole DAB(II)Dipp&#8208;Br in CH3CN (TMS=trimethylsilyl; DAB(II)=1,3,2&#8208;diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in 1&#8722; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N(H)}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp] (1&#8208;H) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory suggests a charge&#8208;transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of 1&#8208;H in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest&#8208;energy excited state at &#955;=669&#8197;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo&#8208;active cluster compounds.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding can play a significant role in designing complex bioinspired structures. Here, two different types of this interaction were employed to construct single and double helices from planar benzotellurazole amides.







Abstract
As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.

         <title>New Radical Route and Insight for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of Benzimidazoles Integrated with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>

We report a conceptually new, highly efficient radical route for the benzimidazole synthesis via radical&#8208;induced cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols and o&#8208;arylenediamines concomitantly with hydrogen (H2) production over Pd modified ultrathin ZnO NSs (Pd/ZnO) under mild conditions.







Abstract
Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower&#8208;cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high&#8208;performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H2) over Pd&#8208;decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). The mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently&#8208;generated C&#8208;centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical&#8208;induced efficient benzimidazole synthesis pairing with H2 evolution by rationally designing semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox systems.

&lt;p&gt;Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower-cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high-performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) over Pd-decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). The mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;-C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently-generated C-centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical-induced efficient benzimidazole synthesis pairing with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution by rationally designing semiconductor-based photoredox systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Gradient Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Crystal Film</title>

         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF on an in situ grown polymer film. The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network and showed improved proton conductivity compared to its polymeric analog.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are ordered supramolecular solid structures, however, nothing much explored as centimetre&#8208;scale self&#8208;standing films. The fabrication of such crystals comprising self&#8208;supported films is challenging due to the limited flexibility and interaction of the crystals, and therefore studies on two&#8208;dimensional macrostructures of HOFs are limited to external supports. Herein, we introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF film on an in situ&#8208;formed covalent organic polymer film (Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF). The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The kinetic&#8208;controlled Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF showed enhanced proton conductivity (8.3&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to its rapid kinetic analogue, Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;COP (2.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which signifies the advantage of bonding&#8208;engineering in the same system.

         <title>Solar Light Driven H2O2 Production and Selective Oxidations Using a Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst Prepared by a Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) prepared via the multicomponent Povarov reaction shows a high and long&#8208;term stable activity for photocatalytic H2O2 production and size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation. The COF can be further used as photocatalyst for a range of important aerobic oxidation reactions including the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes, amines to imines and sulfides to sulfoxides.







Abstract
A chemically stable 2D microporous COF (PMCR&#8208;1) was synthesized via the multicomponent Povarov reaction. PMCR&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable and long&#8208;term stable photocatalytic H2O2 production rate (60&#8197;h) from pure and sea water under visible light. The H2O2 production is markedly enhanced when benzyl alcohol (BA) is added as reductant, which is also due to a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of BA with dangling phenyl moieties in the COF pores introduced by the multicomponent Povarov reaction. Motivated by the concomitant BA oxidation to benzaldehyde during H2O2 formation, the photocatalytic oxidation of various organic substrates such as benzyl amine and methyl sulfide derivatives was investigated. It is shown that the well&#8208;defined micropores of PMCR&#8208;1 enable size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation.

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spiro&#8208;type hole transport material (HTM) was developed by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system (DP). The new HTM features a stabilized HOMO level, a higher glass transition temperature, and improved morphology on the perovskite layer compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. When incorporated into an n&#8208;i&#8208;p device, the DP&#8208;based HTM achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area (0.06&#8197;cm2) devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules (designated area of 27.56&#8197;cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78&#8201;% on a designated area of 27.86&#8197;cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1&#8201;% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2560&#8197;hours and 87&#8201;% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600&#8197;hours.

         <title>The Influence of Regiochemistry on the Performance of Organic Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the influence of sidechain regiochemistry on a series of thiophene&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting polymers, the degree of conformational disorder is found to be a crucial indicator of performance. Maximising non&#8208;covalent planarising interactions and polaronic charge delocalisation during molecular design must consequently be carefully weighed against considerations around conformational restrictions.







Abstract
Thiophenes functionalised in the 3&#8208;position are ubiquitous building blocks for the design and synthesis of organic semiconductors. Their non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature has long been used as a powerful synthetic design tool exemplified by the vastly different properties of regiorandom and regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) owing to the repulsive head&#8208;to&#8208;head interactions between neighbouring side chains in the regiorandom polymer. The renewed interest in highly electron&#8208;rich 3&#8208;alkoxythiophene based polymers for bioelectronic applications opens up new considerations around the regiochemistry of these systems as both the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and head&#8208;to&#8208;head couplings adopt near&#8208;planar conformations due to attractive intramolecular S&#8722;O interactions. To understand how this increased flexibility in the molecular design can be used advantageously, we explore in detail the geometrical and electronic effects that influence the optical, electrochemical, structural, and electrical properties of a series of six polythiophene derivatives with varying regiochemistry and comonomer composition. We show how the interplay between conformational disorder, backbone coplanarity and polaron distribution affects the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction. Ultimately, we use these findings to identify a new conformationally restricted polythiophene derivative for p&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistor applications with performance on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed conductors evidenced by a &#956;C* product of 267&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites Camouflaged with Hybrid Cell Membranes for Accurate Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid cell membranes (HMs) consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membranes and glioma cell membranes were prepared and coated onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles. The obtained HMGINPs inherited good blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier penetration and homologous glioma targeting ability from the two types of source cells, and exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy against early&#8208;stage glioma.







Abstract
Glioma features high fatality rate and short survival time of patients due to its fast growth speed and high invasiveness, hence timely treatment of early&#8208;stage glioma is extremely important. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non&#8208;targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired. We herein proposed a hybrid cell membrane (HM) camouflage strategy to construct therapeutic nanocomposites, in which HM consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membrane and glioma cell membrane was prepared with a simple membrane fusion pathway. By coating HM onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles, the as&#8208;obtained biomimetic therapeutic agent (termed HMGINPs) inherited satisfying BBB penetrability and homologous glioma targeting ability simultaneously from the two source cells. HMGINPs exhibited good biocompatibility and superior therapeutic efficacy towards early&#8208;stage glioma.

         <title>Regulated Ion/Electron&#8208;Conducting Interphase Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ions Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) with ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase was prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. This novel structure suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition due to the fast ionic/electronic transport and high Young's modulus, thus achieving long&#8208;cycling aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metallic Zinc (Zn) is considered as a remarkably promising anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric capacity and low redox potential. Unfortunately, dendritic growth and severe side reactions destabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, and ultimately reduce the electrochemical performance. Here, an artificial protective layer (APL) with a regulated ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase is constructed on the Zn&#8208;metal anode to provide excellent interfacial stability in high&#8208;rate cycling. The superior ionic and moderate electronic conductivity of the APL derives from the co&#8208;embedding of MXene and Zn(CF3SO3)2 salts into the polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, which enables a synergistic effect of local current density reduction during plating and ion transport acceleration during stripping for Zn anode. Furthermore, the high Young's modulus of the protective layer and dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology during cycling suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (2.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and passivation. As a result, in symmetrical cell tests, the modified battery presents a stable life of over 2000 cycles at ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research presents a new insight into the formation and regulation of stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for the Zn&#8208;metal anode.

         <title>Rashba Band Splitting and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Induced by Halogen Bonds in Hybrid Layered Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a new series of 2D perovskites featuring thickness&#8208;dependent hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions. The strength of non&#8208;covalent interaction has a direct impact on the structure symmetry and optoelectronic properties. Stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetry, whereas weaker halogen bonds give rise to non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures, Rashba splitting, suppressed radiative recombination, and bulk photovoltaic effect.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an essential role in directing the self&#8208;assembly of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic crystals. In hybrid halide perovskites, hydrogen bonding has been the paramount non&#8208;covalent interaction. Here, we show another non&#8208;covalent interaction, namely, the halogen bond interaction, that directs a symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly in a new series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites (ICH2CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n is the layer thickness, n=1&#8211;4). Structural analysis shows that the halogen bond strength varies with the layer thickness. For the odd number (n=1, 3) layered perovskites, stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetric structures, whereas for the n=2 layered perovskites, weaker halogen bonds result in non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Transient reflection spectroscopy shows a suppressed radiative recombination rate (k2&#8776;0) and prolonged spin lifetime for n=2 structure, suggesting an enhanced Rashba band splitting effect. The structural asymmetry is further confirmed with a reversible bulk photovoltaic effect. Our work provides a new design strategy to enable hybrid perovskites with emerging properties and functionalities associated with structural asymmetry.

         <title>A General Autofluorescence Method to Characterize Polymerization Progress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potentially general autofluorescence method that does not rely on traditional fluorogenic functional groups enables real&#8208;time/in&#8208;line spectroscopic monitoring of polymerization progress. Fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) is developed and demonstrated. Changes in (auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching correlate linearly with polymer degree of cure.







Abstract
An autofluorescence technique to characterize polymerization progress in real time/in line was developed, which functioned in the absence of typical fluorogenic groups on the monomer or polymer. The monomer dicyclopentadiene and polymer polydicyclopentadiene are hydrocarbons that lack traditional functional groups for fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the autofluorescence of formulations containing this monomer and polymer during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was harnessed for reaction monitoring. The methods fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and here&#8208;developed fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) characterized polymerization progress in these native systems&#8212;without requiring exogenous fluorophore. (Auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery changes during polymerization correlated linearly to degree of cure, providing a quantitative link with reaction progress. These changing signals also provided relative rates of background polymerization, enabling comparison of 10 different catalyst&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;stabilized formulations. Multiple&#8208;well analysis demonstrated suitability for future high&#8208;throughput evaluation of formulations for thermosets. The central concept of the combined autofluorescence and FLRAP/FRAP method may be extendable to monitoring other polymerization reactions previously overlooked for lack of an obvious fluorescence handle.

         <title>Bioinspired Single&#8208;Atom Sites Enable Efficient Oxygen Activation for Switching Anodic/Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring axial coordination of Fe sites for charge redistribution realizes efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to generate specific active intermediates. Highly active hydroxyl radicals produced by axial N&#8208;involved systems enable direct cathodic electrochemiluminescence, while C&#8208;decorated catalysts preferentially form superoxide anion radicals and only present anodic luminescence.

Exploring advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerators with superior oxygen reduction activity that generate rich reactive oxygen species (ROS) has attracted great attention in boosting luminol&#8208;O2 electrochemiluminescence (ECL). However, tuning accelerators for efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to switch anodic/cathodic ECL is very challenging. Herein, we report that enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with axial N/C coordination structures (FeN5, FeN4&#169; SACs) can generate specific ROS for cathodic/anodic ECL conversion. Mechanistic studies reveal that FeN5 sites prefer to produce highly active hydroxyl radicals and afford direct cathodic luminescence by promoting the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds through N&#8208;induced electron redistribution. In contrast, FeN4&#169; sites tend to produce superoxide radicals, resulting in inefficient anodic ECL. Benefiting from the enhanced cathodic ECL, FeN5 SAC&#8208;based immunosensor was constructed for the sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers.

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroatomic&#8208; and heptagons&#8208; doped multiple helicenes were successfully synthesized and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. They exhibit distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circular dichroism (CD) signals, with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99&#8201;% and 65&#8201;% with narrow FWHM of 24&#8197;nm and 22&#8197;nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.

         <title>Design of the Ionic Organic Nonlinear Optical Material NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4] with Ultrawide Band Gap and Moderate Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent organic flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit, through reasonable nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;favourable layered design, a deep&#8208;ultraviolet ionic organic nonlinear optical crystal, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], with an ultrawide band gap and moderate birefringence was successfully obtained.







Abstract
Ionic organic crystals containing organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated units has become one of the hot spots as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although this type of ionic organic NLO crystals commonly have remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, they also suffer from overlarge birefringences and relatively small band gaps that be hardly beyond 6.2&#8197;eV. Herein, a flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit was theoretically revealed, showing great potential for designing NLO crystals with balanced optical properties. Accordingly, through the reasonable NLO&#8208;favourable layered design, a new ionic organic material, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], was successfully obtained. As expected, it achieves not only a large SHG effect (4&#215;KDP), but also a suitable birefringence (0.06@546&#8197;nm) and an ultrawide band gap (&gt;6.5&#8197;eV). This study provides a new flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO&#8208;active unit, contributing to design more ionic organic NLO materials with excellent balanced optical properties.

         <title>Imaging the Footprint of Nanoscale Electrochemical Reactions for Assessing Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a new optical microscopy technique to measure the synergistic effect of metal hydroxide coatings on the hydrogen evolution reaction at the individual particle level in neutral media. The technique involves using hydroxide halo formation as a footprint of the reaction, and can provide real&#8208;time operando quantification of catalytic activity.







Abstract
This work proposes a novel method for measuring the intrinsic activity of single metal&#8208;based nanoparticles towards water reduction in neutral media at industrially relevant current densities. Instead of using gas nanobubbles as proxy, the method uses optical microscopy to track the local footprint of the reaction through the precipitation of metal hydroxide, which is associated to the local pH increase during electrocatalysis. The results show the electrocatalytic activities of different types of metal nanoparticles and bifunctionnal core&#8208;shell nanostructures made of Ni and Pt, and demonstrate the importance of metal hydroxide nano&#8208;shells in enhancing electrocatalysis. This method should be generalizable to any electrocatalytic reaction involving pH changes such as nitrate or CO2 reduction.

         <title>Photochemically&#8208;Driven CO2 Release Using a Metastable&#8208;State Photoacid for Energy Efficient Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat is achieved for simulated and amino acid&#8208;based direct air capture systems by regulating solution pHs via a photoinduced proton transfer of a reversible metastable&#8208;state photoacid, leading to energetically sustainable and economically feasible climate change mitigation solutions using solar energy.







Abstract
One of the grand challenges underlying current direct air capture (DAC) technologies relates to the intensive energy cost for sorbent regeneration and CO2 release, making the massive scale (GtCO2/year) deployment required to have a positive impact on climate change economically unfeasible. This challenge underscores the critical need to develop new DAC processes with substantially reduced regeneration energies. Here, we report a photochemically&#8208;driven approach for CO2 release by exploiting the unique properties of an indazole metastable&#8208;state photoacid (mPAH). Our measurements on simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems revealed the potential of mPAH to be used for CO2 release cycles by regulating pH changes and associated isomers driven by light. Upon irradiating with moderate intensity light, a &#8776;55&#8201;% and &#8776;68&#8201;% to &#8776;78&#8201;% conversion of total inorganic carbon to CO2 was found for the simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of on&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat, thereby providing an energy efficient pathway for the regeneration of DAC sorbents.

Upon irradiating with moderate intensity light, a &#8776;55&#8201;% and &#8776;68&#8201;% to &#8776;78&#8201;% conversion of total inorganic carbon to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found for the simulated and amino acid-based DAC systems, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of &lt;i&gt;on-demand&lt;/i&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release under &lt;i&gt;ambient&lt;/i&gt; conditions using light instead of heat, thereby providing an energy efficient pathway for the regeneration of DAC sorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ex situ Generation of Thiazyl Trifluoride (NSF3) as a Gaseous SuFEx Hub
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthetic procedure for the efficient ex situ generation of thiazyl trifluoride gas (N&#8801;SF3) as a new Sulfur(VI)&#8208;Fluoride Exchange hub. In typical SuFEx fashion, this triple&#8208;bonded azasulfur(VI) fluoride reagent and its mono&#8208;substituted derivatives react highly effectively with various nucleophiles to deliver a library of unreported thiazynes.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry, an all&#8208;encompassing term for substitution events that replace fluoride at an electrophilic sulfur(VI), enables the rapid and flexible assembly of linkages around a SVI core. Although a myriad of nucleophiles and applications works very well with the SuFEx concept, the electrophile design has remained largely SO2&#8208;based. Here, we introduce S&#8801;N&#8208;based fluorosulfur(VI) reagents to the realm of SuFEx chemistry. Thiazyl trifluoride (NSF3) gas is shown to serve as an excellent parent compound and SuFEx hub to efficiently synthesize mono&#8208; and disubstituted fluorothiazynes in an ex situ generation workflow. Gaseous NSF3 was evolved from commercial reagents in a nearly quantitative fashion at ambient conditions. Moreover, the mono&#8208;substituted thiazynes could be extended further as SuFEx handles and be engaged in the synthesis of unsymmetrically disubstituted thiazynes. These results provide valuable insights into the versatility of these understudied sulfur functionalities paving the way for future applications.

         <title>Stochastic Simulation of Controlled Radical Polymerization Forming Dendritic Hyperbranched Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The results suggest that the observed dispersities (&#272;=1.5&#8211;2) originated from the distribution of branch numbers and that the branch structures are well controlled. Furthermore, the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one.







Abstract
Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The simulation program successfully reproduced the change of dispersities (&#272;s) during the polymerization process. Furthermore, the simulation suggested that the observed &#272;s (=1.5&#8211;2) are due to the distribution of the number of branches instead of undesired side reactions, and that the branch structures are well controlled. In addition, the analysis of the polymer structure reveals that the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one. The simulation also suggested the slight dependence of branch density on molecular weight, which was experimentally confirmed by synthesizing HBPs with an evolmer having phenyl group.

         <title>Evidence of a Uranium&#8208;Paddlewheel Node in a Catecholate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through solvothermal combination of uranyl and a redox&#8208;active linker, we reduced the U&#8722;O bonds and subsequently formed a metal&#8208;organic framework built from a uranium paddlewheel node. This paddlewheel node, where two uranium atoms are connected by four hexahydroxytriphenylene species and capped with water moieties, is unprecedented.







Abstract
The interactions between uranium and non&#8208;innocent organic species are an essential component of fundamental uranium redox chemistry. However, they have seldom been explored in the context of multidimensional, porous materials. Uranium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a new angle to study these interactions, as these self&#8208;assembled species stabilize uranium species through immobilization by organic linkers within a crystalline framework, while potentially providing a method for adjusting metal oxidation state through coordination of non&#8208;innocent linkers. We report the synthesis of the MOF NU&#8208;1700, assembled from U4+&#8208;paddlewheel nodes and catecholate&#8208;based linkers. We propose this highly unusual structure, which contains two U4+ ions in a paddlewheel built from four linkers&#8212;a first among uranium materials&#8212;as a result of extensive characterization via powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), sorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in addition to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Phase Transition Engineering of Host Perovskite toward Optimal Exsolution&#8208;facilitated Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have implemented a set of strategies to precisely control the phase evolution of host perovskite without compromising exsolution. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an example, we demonstrated how regulating phase structure can enhance the activity and stability of exsolved perovskites, emphasizing the importance of phase evolution control in catalytic chemistry occurring on perovskites with exsolution.







Abstract
The in situ exsolution technique of nanoparticles has brought new opportunities for the utilization of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts in solid oxide cells. However, the lack of control over the structural evolution of host perovskites during the promotion of exsolution has restricted the architectural exploitation of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskites. In this study, we strategically broke the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between promoted exsolution and suppressed phase transition via B&#8208;site supplement, thus broadening the scope of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskite materials. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an illustrative case study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity and stability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles (P&#8208;eNs) can be selectively enhanced by regulating the explicit phase of host perovskites, accentuating the critical role of the architectures of perovskite scaffold in catalytic reactions occurring on P&#8208;eNs. The concept demonstrated could potentially pave the way for designing the advanced exsolution&#8208;facilitated P&#8208;eNs materials and unveiling a wide range of catalytic chemistry taking place on P&#8208;eNs.

However, the lack of control over the structural evolution of host perovskites during the promotion of exsolution has restricted the architectural exploitation of exsolution-facilitated perovskites.

Mechanistic studies revealed that the steric effect modulates the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface, enabling the molecule to undergo multistep transformation along the sequence of bent, planar, and twisted structures.







Abstract
We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt;500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, the introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Monosubstituted Sulfondiimines by Metal&#8208;free Iminations of Sulfilimium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an operationally simple and safe method for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines starting from stable sulfiliminium salts. This metal&#8208;free procedure employs a combination of iodine(III) reagents with iodine and 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), providing particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted sulfondiimines in up to 85&#8201;% yield. Mechanistically, electrophilic nitrene cations are suggested as the reactive intermediates.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are marginalized entities among nitrogen&#8208;containing organosulfur compounds, despite offering promising properties for applications in various fields including medicinal and agrochemical. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid synthetic procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines that overcomes current limitations in their synthetic accessibility. Particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl substrates, which are commonly difficult to convert by existing methods, react well with a combination of iodine, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), and iminoiodinanes (PhINR) in acetonitrile (MeCN) to furnish the corresponding sulfondiimines in yields up to 85&#8201;% (25&#8197;examples). Valuable &#8220;free&#8221; NH&#8208;N&#8242;H&#8208;sulfondiimines can then be accessed by N&#8208;deprotection under mild reaction conditions. Several experimental observations suggest a mechanistic pathway diverging from the common radical&#8208;based iodine/iminoiodinane mechanism. Based on the experimental results in combination with data obtained by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis we propose a direct amination from PhINNs and a reaction path via a cationic iodonitrene.

         <title>A Radio&#8208;Pharmaceutical Fluorescent Probe for Synergistic Cancer Radiotherapy and Ratiometric Imaging of Tumor Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical imaging agent and radiosensitized pharmaceutical containing diselenide and metronidazole was developed to realize the radiosensitizing effect and report the ROS levels through ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This molecule exhibited synergetic radiosensitization and could monitor the radiotherapy response for both hypoxic tumors and orthotopic glioma.







Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective and widely applied cancer treatment strategy in clinic. However, it usually suffers from radioresistance of tumor cells and severs side effects of excessive radiation dose. Therefore, it is highly significant to improve radiotherapeutic performance and monitor real&#8208;time tumor response, achieving precise and safe RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive radio&#8208;pharmaceutical molecule containing chemical radiosensitizers of diselenide and nitroimidazole (BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN) is reported. BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN exhibits enhanced radiotherapeutic effect via a multifaceted mechanisms and self&#8208;monitoring ROS levels in tumors during RT. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the diselenide produces high levels of ROS, leading to enhanced DNA damage of cancer cell. Afterwards, the nitroimidazole in the molecule inhibits the damaged DNA repair, offering a synergetic radiosensitization effect of cancer. Moreover, the probe shows low and high NIR&#8208;II fluorescence ratios in the absence and presence of ROS, which is suitable for precise and quantitative monitoring of ROS during sensitized RT. The integrated system is successfully applied for radiosensitization and the early prediction of in vitro and in vivo RT efficacy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biscyclopropanes Using Alkynes as Dicarbene Equivalents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed double cyclopropanation of CF2H&#8208;substituted enyne with alkenes is reported. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed with excellent stereoselectivity in one step. The method was extended to the cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation. In these processes, the functional alkyne is used as a dicarbene equivalent and 3 new rings are formed.







Abstract
Chiral biscyclopropanes are an important skeleton in many bioactive molecules. However, there are few routes to synthesize these molecules with high stereoselectivity due to the nature of multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report the first example of Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of bicyclopropanes with alkynes as dicarbene equivalents. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed in excellent stereoselectivity. This protocol features high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol was also extended to the cascaded cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation with excellent stereoselectivities. In these processes, both sp&#8208;carbons of alkyne were converted into stereogenic sp3&#8208;carbons. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cooperative weak hydrogen bonds between the substrates and the dirhodium catalyst may play key roles in this reaction.

         <title>Tetrazole Linkages as Photoactivated Fuels for Light&#8208;Regulated Photothermal/Photocatalytic Propulsion of Versatile Polymer Nanoplatforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated versatile polymer nanoplatforms with asymmetric geometry enable on&#8208;demand integration of various functionalities via tetrazole linkages. In response to UV or visible light, tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels simultaneously perform photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the polymer nanoplatforms for powering the multimode synergistic propulsion, thus showing potential in bio&#8208;applications.







Abstract
Colloidal motors with multimode propulsion have attracted considerable attention because of enhanced transportability. It is a great challenge to fabricate colloidal motors powered by a single engine for multimode synergistic propulsion. Herein, we report on Janus versatile polymer nanoplatforms integrating various functionalities via tetrazole linkages for light&#8208;regulated multimode synergistic propulsion in the liquid. The presence of tetrazole linkages in the polymers endows the nanoparticles with various photoresponsive capabilities. A sole energy source (ultraviolet or visible light) simultaneously activates photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the tetrazole&#8208;containing polymer phase at one side of asymmetric nanoparticles for converting light energy into photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion independent of the surrounding chemical medium. The photoactivated locomotion using tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels highly corresponds to light wavelengths, light powers and tetrazole contents. The tetrazole linkages capable of incorporating various functionalities to the polymer nanoparticles allow on&#8208;demand customizing of the colloidal motors, showing great potential in bio&#8208;applications.

     alt="Tetrazole Linkages as Photoactivated Fuels for Light-Regulated Photothermal/Photocatalytic Propulsion of Versatile Polymer Nanoplatforms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoactivated versatile polymer nanoplatforms with asymmetric geometry enable on-demand integration of various functionalities via tetrazole linkages. In response to UV or visible light, tetrazoles as light-triggered fuels simultaneously perform photocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and photothermal conversion within the polymer nanoplatforms for powering the multimode synergistic propulsion, thus showing potential in bio-applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal motors with multimode propulsion have attracted considerable attention because of enhanced transportability. It is a great challenge to fabricate colloidal motors powered by a single engine for multimode synergistic propulsion. Herein, we report on Janus versatile polymer nanoplatforms integrating various functionalities via tetrazole linkages for light-regulated multimode synergistic propulsion in the liquid. The presence of tetrazole linkages in the polymers endows the nanoparticles with various photoresponsive capabilities. A sole energy source (ultraviolet or visible light) simultaneously activates photocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and photothermal conversion within the tetrazole-containing polymer phase at one side of asymmetric nanoparticles for converting light energy into photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion independent of the surrounding chemical medium. The photoactivated locomotion using tetrazoles as light-triggered fuels highly corresponds to light wavelengths, light powers and tetrazole contents. The tetrazole linkages capable of incorporating various functionalities to the polymer nanoparticles allow on-demand customizing of the colloidal motors, showing great potential in bio-applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Selective Oxidation of Aromatic Alkanes by Double Cobalt Active Sites over Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;rich Mesoporous Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4) was synthesized by a simple ligand&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly method. Benefitting from abundant oxygen vacancies and the mesoporous structure of mCo3O4, a unique catalytic path was presented with direct oxidation of aromatic alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones.







Abstract
The development of efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of hydrocarbon to functional compounds remains a challenge. Herein, mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4&#8208;350) showed excellent catalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes, especially for oxidation of ethylbenzene with a conversion of 42&#8201;% and selectivity of 90&#8201;% for acetophenone at 120&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, mCo3O4 presented a unique catalytic path of direct oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones. Density functional theory calculations revealed that oxygen vacancies in mCo3O4 activate around Co atoms, causing electronic state change from Co3+(Oh)&#8594;Co2+(Oh). Co2+(Oh) has great attraction to ethylbenzene, and weak interaction with O2, which provide insufficient O2 for gradual oxidation of phenylethanol to acetophenone. Combined with high energy barrier for forming phenylethanol, the direct oxidation path from ethylbenzene to acetophenone is kinetically favorable on mCo3O4, sharply contrasted to non&#8208;selective oxidation of ethylbenzene on commercial Co3O4.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyethyleneimines from the Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the synthesis of polyethyleneimines is reported based on manganese catalysed coupling of ethylene glycol and ethylene diamine. This avoids the use of the highly toxic feedstock, namely aziridine, that is currently used for the production of this polymer.







Abstract
Polyethyleneimines find many applications in products such as detergents, adhesives, cosmetics, and for processes such as tissue culture, gene therapy, and CO2 capture. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for the production of the branched polyethyleneimines involves aziridine feedstock which is a highly toxic, volatile and mutagenic chemical and raises significant concern to human health and environment. We report here a novel method for the synthesis of branched polyethyleneimine derivative from ethylene glycol and ethylenediamine which are much safer, environmentally benign, commercially available and potentially renewable feedstock. The polymerisation reaction is catalysed by a complex of an earth&#8208;abundant metal, manganese and liberates H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Our mechanistic studies using a combination of DFT computation and experiment suggest that the reaction proceeds by the formation and subsequent hydrogenation of imine intermediates.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroalkenylation and Hydroalkynylation of Alkenes Enabled by a Transient Directing Group: Catalyst Generality through Rigidification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of tert&#8208;leucine as a chiral transient directing group enables the enantioselective reductive&#8208;Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl benzaldehydes under palladium catalysis. The dual catalytic reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and alkynes represents a powerful strategy for rapid generation of molecular complexity. Herein, we report a transient directing group (TDG) strategy to facilitate site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkynylation of alkenylaldehyes using alkenyl and alkynyl bromides, respectively, allowing for construction of a stereocenter at the &#948;&#8208;position with respect to the aldehyde. Computational studies reveal the dual beneficial roles of rigid TDGs, such as L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine, in promoting TDG binding and inducing high levels of enantioselectivity in alkene insertion with a variety of migrating groups.

An active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;mediated strategy paves a way for enhancing ethanol production from CO2&#160;electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202302096), Xu Xiang, Jing He and co&#8208;workers unveil that the increased *H coverage on a layered precursor&#8208;derived Cu&#8208;based catalyst favors hydrogenation of *HCCOH to *HCCHOH and prioritizes the ethanol pathway, enabling highly efficient and durable production of ethanol. Such a strategy could be of potential use in *H&#8208;involved reduction reactions.

Organic electrode materials could break the dependency of lithium&#8208;ion batteries on minerals that are scarce and mined in conflict zones. In their Communication (e202300892), Yanliang Liang, Judy&#8197;I. Wu, Ognjen&#8197;&#352;. Miljani&#263;, Yan Yao et&#8197;al. report a naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil macrocycle as a promising organic electrode candidate. Its eight redox&#8208;active groups bring about a high specific capacity of 279 mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, while the low solubility&#8212;a consequence of the shape&#8208;persistent structure&#8212;results in stable cycling performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity, utilizing MOFs embedded with a moderately acidic guest&#8212;zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA)&#8212;was demonstrated by Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302376). HSA not only acted as a proton source, but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. The MOFs, which had been filled with high quantities of HSA using a sustained concentration gradient method, exhibited impressive superprotonic conductivity, in the order of 10&#8722;1 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, they maintained their stability for a period of 7 days.

         <title>A Crowning Achievement: The First Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy was designed and implemented by Wu and co&#8208;workers, enabling the first solution&#8208;phase synthesis of circumcoronene derivatives, and providing the first direct evidence to the structure of the debated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.







Abstract
Circumcoronene is a highly symmetric polybenzenoid hydrocarbon that has fascinated organic chemists and materials scientists for decades. However, until recently, it had only been studied theoretically, because its synthesis in solution remained challenging. In a recent report, Wu and co&#8208;workers described the first successful solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of crystalline circumcoronene derivatives, validating the long&#8208;predicted Clar structure. Their synthetic approach enables preparation of new polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons with multiple K&#8208;regions, which are difficult to obtain, and expands our understanding of the chemistry of these systems.

         <title>Carbon Deposit Analysis in Catalyst Deactivation, Regeneration, and Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article discusses the role of carbon species deposited from various feedstock molecules or formed over time during a catalytic process, including ways to mitigate the effects of these carbon species by catalyst design, regeneration or rejuvenation. This is done for various industrially relevant systems, including the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. New tools for the direct observation of the 3D&#8208;distribution of carbon species within the catalyst pore network are also described.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon conversion catalysts suffer from deactivation by deposition or formation of carbon deposits. Carbon deposit formation is thermodynamically favored above 350&#8201;&#176;C, even in some hydrogen&#8208;rich environments. We discuss four basic mechanisms: a carbenium&#8208;ion based mechanism taking place on acid sites of zeolites or bifunctional catalysts, a metal&#8208;induced formation of soft coke (i.e., oligomers of small olefins) on bifunctional catalysts, a radical&#8208;mediated mechanism in higher&#8208;temperature processes, and fast&#8208;growing carbon filament formation. Catalysts deactivate because carbon deposits block pores at different length scales, or directly block active sites. Some deactivated catalysts can be re&#8208;used, others can be regenerated or have to be discarded. Catalyst and process design can mitigate the effects of deactivation. New analytical tools allow for the direct observation (in some cases even under in situ or operando conditions) of the 3D&#8208;distribution of coke&#8208;type species as a function of catalyst structure and lifetime.

         <title>Traffic Lights for Catalysis: Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular and Extended Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as flowers blooming in response to the sun attract bees to continue their natural life cycle, molecules which respond to external stimuli can be used to control catalytic cycles. Development of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular and extended catalytic platforms is a pathway for precise tuning of reaction yield, rate, or enantioselectivity that could pave the way for the next era of sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Sulfonium Salts as Acceptors in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes is a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radicals. Sulfonium salt acceptors promise to dramatically expand the range of radicals that can be generated and exploited using EDA chemistry; the use of readily installed &#8220;sulfonium tags&#8221; relaxes the electronic constraints typically imposed on the parent substrate by an EDA complexation approach.







Abstract
The photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexation, however, imposes electronic constraints on the donor and acceptor components and this can limit the range of radicals that can be generated using the approach. New EDA complexation strategies exploiting sulfonium salts allow radicals to be generated from native functionality. For example, aryl sulfonium salts, formed by the activation of arenes, can serve as the acceptor components in EDA complexes due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature. This &#8220;sulfonium tag&#8221; approach relaxes the electronic constraints on the parent substrate and dramatically expands the range of radicals that can be generated using EDA complexation. In this review, these new applications of sulfonium salts will be introduced and the areas of chemical space rendered accessible through this innovation will be highlighted.

         <title>Photocatalysis as an Effective Tool for Upcycling Polymers into Value&#8208;Added Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis has recently evolved to a powerful tool to convert plastics directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. Researchers developed distinct light&#8208;driven depolymerization strategies for various polymers, ranging from hydroxylated (bio)polymers to real&#8208;life polystyrene. These methods operate under mild conditions, show high efficiency, and thus constitute a promising alternative to traditional recycling methods.







Abstract
Shaping a sustainable future is closely tied to the development of advanced plastic recycling technologies. As global recycling rates remain low, the lion's share of post&#8208;consumer plastics is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. This unbalanced plastic waste management not only poses severe environmental risks, but also entails an irrevocable loss of chemical resources that are embedded in synthetic polymers. To give plastic waste a new life, a series of photocatalytic methods has recently been reported that convert polymers directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. These approaches operate at ambient temperature, show high reactivity/selectivity, and provide alternative reaction pathways as compared to thermal depolymerizations. This Minireview highlights the scientific breakthroughs in upcycling polymers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis under environmentally benign conditions.

         <title>Controlled Genetic Encoding of Unnatural Amino Acids in a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the application of the genetic code expansion technique to achieve the site&#8208;specific modification of the sensing region of a nanopore. The rationally designed conformation of unnatural amino acid (UAA) residues provides a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of peptides and pore. The chemical environment of the sensing region facilitates the direct discrimination of the mixtures of peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids.







Abstract
Conventional protein engineering methods for modifying protein nanopores are typically limited to 20 natural amino acids, which restrict the diversity of the nanopores in structure and function. To enrich the chemical environment inside the nanopore, we employed the genetic code expansion (GCE) technique to site&#8208;specifically incorporate the unnatural amino acid (UAA) into the sensing region of aerolysin nanopores. This approach leveraged the efficient pyrrolysine&#8208;based aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;tRNA pair for a high yield of pore&#8208;forming protein. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single&#8208;molecule sensing experiments demonstrated that the conformation of UAA residues provided a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of target molecules and the pore. This rationally designed chemical environment enabled the direct discrimination of multiple peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Our work provides a new framework for endowing nanopores with unique sensing properties that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.

Our work provides a new framework for endowing nanopores with unique sensing properties that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzil Derivatives for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil octaketone is an excellent cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. It reversibly accepts eight electrons per molecule, has a specific capacity of 279&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and shows stable cycling performance with &#8776;65&#8201;% retention after 135&#8197;cycles. Its shape&#8208;persistent, symmetric structure rigidifies during an eight&#8208;electron reduction, ensuring that this macrocycle remains insoluble in various redox states.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials could revolutionize batteries because of their high energy densities, the use of Earth&#8208;abundant elements, and structural diversity which allows fine&#8208;tuning of electrochemical properties. However, small organic molecules and intermediates formed during their redox cycling in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have high solubility in organic electrolytes, leading to rapid decay of cycling performance. We report the use of three cyclotetrabenzil octaketone macrocycles as cathode materials for LIBs. The rigid and insoluble naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil reversibly accepts eight electrons in a two&#8208;step process with a specific capacity of 279&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance with &#8776;65&#8201;% capacity retention after 135&#8197;cycles. DFT calculations indicate that its reduction increases both ring strain and ring rigidity, as demonstrated by computed high distortion energies, repulsive regions in NCI plots, and close [C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C] contacts between the naphthalenes. This work highlights the importance of shape&#8208;persistency and ring strain in the design of redox&#8208;active macrocycles that maintain very low solubility in various redox states.

         <title>Resolidified Chalcogen Precursors for High&#8208;Quality 2D Semiconductor Growth</title>

Chalcogen powder is pre&#8208;melted and resolidified to give a stable chalcogen precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of transition metal dichalcogenides. The obtained monolayer tungsten disulfide is uniform and shows high optical and structural quality.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre&#8208;melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6&#177;1.9&#8197;meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9&#177;3)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2 and (10&#177;4)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.

         <title>Insights into Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on SnS2: Main Product Switch from Hydrogen to Formate by Pulsed Potential Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing S&#8208;vacancies into SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of CO2RR but leads to exclusive H2 evolution under static potential electrolysis. Pulsed potential electrolysis results in in situ generation of partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x in the catalyst, which leads to a switch of the main product from hydrogen to formate during the CO2RR with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to H2.







Abstract
Tin disulfide (SnS2) is a promising candidate for electrosynthesis of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate while the low activity and selectivity remain a great challenge. Herein, we report the potentiostatic and pulsed potential CO2RR performance of SnS2 nanosheets (NSs) with tunable S&#8208;vacancy and exposure of Sn&#8208;atoms or S&#8208;atoms prepared controllably by calcination of SnS2 at different temperatures under the H2/Ar atmosphere. The catalytic activity of S&#8208;vacancy SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) is improved 1.8&#8197;times, but it exhibits an exclusive hydrogen evolution with about 100&#8201;% FE under all potentials investigated in the static conditions. The theoretical calculations reveal that the adsorption of *H on the Vs&#8208;SnS2 surface is energetically more favorable than the carbonaceous intermediates, resulting in active site coverage that hinders the carbon intermediates from being adsorbed. Fortunately, the main product can be switched from hydrogen to formate by applying pulsed potential electrolysis benefiting from in situ formed partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to hydrogen. This work highlights not only the Vs&#8208;SnS2 NSs lead to exclusively H2 formation, but also provides insights into the systematic design of highly selective CO2 reduction catalysts reconstructed by pulsed potential electrolysis.

         <title>A Chemoenzymatic Approach To Produce a Cyclic Analogue of the Analgesic Drug MVIIA (Ziconotide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic method has been developed to prepare backbone cyclic analogues of the &#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA. The most potent cyclic analogue, cM&#8208;7, shows highly improved stability and maintains the activity of the native peptide.







Abstract
Ziconotide (&#969;&#8208;conotoxin MVIIA) is an approved analgesic for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the need for intrathecal administration and adverse effects have limited its widespread application. Backbone cyclization is one way to improve the pharmaceutical properties of conopeptides, but so far chemical synthesis alone has been unable to produce correctly folded and backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA. In this study, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP)&#8208;mediated cyclization was used to generate backbone cyclic analogues of MVIIA for the first time. Cyclization using six&#8208; to nine&#8208;residue linkers did not perturb the overall structure of MVIIA, and the cyclic analogues of MVIIA showed inhibition of voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) and substantially improved stability in human serum and stimulated intestinal fluid. Our study reveals that AEP transpeptidases are capable of cyclizing structurally complex peptides that chemical synthesis cannot achieve and paves the way for further improving the therapeutic value of conotoxins.

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated iontronic nanotool was developed for the study of single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation. With the nanotool, an N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;modified deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) was used for profiling a representative m6&#8197;A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO), which also released a DNA sequence that could be programmed as an antisense strand against intracellular FTO&#8208;mRNA.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell studies; however, solutions to epigenetic questions remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within a nanopipette for profiling a representative m6A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Cytotrienin A: Late&#8208;Stage Installation of C11 Side Chain onto the Macrolactam Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of cytotrienin A, an ansamycin antibiotic with apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity, is described. The strategic use of the redox properties of hydroquinone and the traceless Staudinger reaction enabled the late&#8208;stage installation of the C11 side chain, which plays a critical role in its biological activity, onto the macrolactam and opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of ansamycin antibiotics.







Abstract
Cytotrienin A, an ansamycin&#8208;class antibiotic, exhibits potent apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity and has attracted much attention as a lead compound for anticancer drugs. Herein, we report a new asymmetric synthetic route to cytotrienin A, employing an unexplored approach involving the late&#8208;stage installation of a C11 side chain onto the macrolactam core. In this strategy, we utilized the redox properties of hydroquinone and installed a side chain on the sterically hindered C11 hydroxy group by the traceless Staudinger reaction. This study also demonstrated that the boron&#8208;Wittig/iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling sequence was effective for the concise and selective construction of the (E,E,E)&#8208;conjugated triene moiety. The developed route opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of the side chains of these ansamycin antibiotics and the preparation of other synthetic analogs and chemical probes for further biological studies.

         <title>Non&#8208;canonical Biosynthesis of the Brexane&#8208;Type Bishomosesquiterpene Chlororaphen through Two Consecutive Methylation Steps in Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 and Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4</title>

         <dc:description>
In the biosynthetic pathway of the first natural brexane&#8208;type compound, chlororaphen, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is methylated and cyclized by a non&#8208;canonical FPP methyltransferase (FPP&#8208;MT), furnishing &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP). Methylation by the &#947;&#8208;PSPP&#8208;MT yields &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP), which is converted into the bishomosesquiterpene chlororaphen by the chlororaphen synthase (ChloS).







Abstract
A non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic pathway furnishing the first natural brexane&#8208;type bishomosesquiterpene (chlororaphen, C17H28) was elucidated in the &#947;&#8208;proteobacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6. A combination of genome mining, pathway cloning, in vitro enzyme assays, and NMR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;step pathway initiated by C10 methylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP, C15) along with cyclization and ring contraction to furnish monocyclic &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP, C16). Subsequent C&#8208;methylation of &#947;&#8208;PSPP by a second C&#8208;methyltransferase furnishes the monocyclic &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP, C17), serving as the substrate for the terpene synthase. The same biosynthetic pathway was characterized in the &#946;&#8208;proteobacterium Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4, demonstrating that non&#8208;canonical homosesquiterpene biosynthesis is more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously anticipated.

         <title>Radical Coupling Initiated by Organophosphine Addition to Ynoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining established two electron nucleophilic catalysis of organophosphines with photoredox organocatalysis has allowed the discovery of a mechanistically unusual Giese coupling reaction. In addition to addressing a limitation in traditional photoredox coupling with electron&#8208;poor alkynes these studies demonstrate the viability of reaction designs that merge traditional nucleophilic phosphines organocatalysis and photoredox events.







Abstract
Dual nucleophilic phosphine photoredox catalysis is yet to be developed due to facile oxidation of the phosphine organocatalyst to the phosphoranyl radical cation. Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.

Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mucin&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Chain Polymer (MIP) Fibers as Potent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological mucus, here, we report multi gram&#8208;scale synthesis of dendronized polysulfates as mucin&#8208;inspired virus&#8208;binding polymer (MIPs). Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis reveals their single chain fiber morphology. These biocompatible synthesized fibers inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and inhibitory activities depend on the length of the fibers.







Abstract
Mucins are the key component of the defensive mucus barrier. They are extended fibers of very high molecular weight with diverse biological functions depending strongly on their specific structural parameters. Here, we present a mucin&#8208;inspired nanostructure, produced via a synthetic methodology to prepare methacrylate&#8208;based dendronized polysulfates (MIP&#8208;1) on a multi gram&#8208;scale with high molecular weight (MW=450&#8197;kDa) and thiol end&#8208;functionalized mucin&#8208;inspired polymer (MIP) via RAFT polymerization. Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis of MIP&#8208;1 confirmed a mucin&#8208;mimetic wormlike single&#8208;chain fiber structure (length=144&#177;59&#8197;nm) in aqueous solution. This biocompatible fiber showed promising activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its mutant strain, with a remarkable low half maximal (IC50) inhibitory concentration (IC50=10.0&#8197;nM). Additionally, we investigate the impact of fiber length on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 inhibition by testing other functional polymers (MIPs) of varying fiber lengths.

         <title>Disc&#8208;Like Silver Nanocluster Ag93 Built with Bicapped Hexagonal Prismatic Ag15 and Ino Decahedral Ag13 Units</title>

The largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4) is prepared. It is a disc&#8208;shaped structure, its Ag69 kernel consists of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 wrapped by six Ino decahedral Ag13 units through edge&#8208;sharing. The central silver atom has an unprecedented high coordination number of 14. This is the first time that Ino decahedra act as building blocks to assemble a supercluster.







Abstract
The reduction of alkynyl&#8208;silver and phosphine&#8208;silver precursors with a weak reducing reagent Ph2SiH2 led to the formation of a novel silver nanocluster [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4), which is the largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters. This disc&#8208;shaped cluster has a Ag69 kernel consisting of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 unit wrapped by six Ino decahedra through edge&#8208;sharing. This is the first time that Ino decahedra are used as a building block to assemble a cluster of clusters. Moreover, the central silver atom has a coordination number of 14, which is the highest in metal nanoclusters. This work provides a diverse metal packing pattern in metal nanoclusters, which is helpful for understanding metal cluster assembling mechanisms.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional LDH Film Templating for Controlled Preparation and Performance Enhancement of Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer facilitates controlled interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride and piperazine, which results in two membranes with good separation performances towards salts and dyes. Due to the low water transport resistance of the LDH layer and the thinner polyamide layer, the composite membrane has a larger flux, which is a breakthrough in the trade&#8208;off between permeance and selectivity.







Abstract
Tailored design of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes that can be used in a variety of applications such as water desalination, resource recovery, and sewage treatment is desirable. Herein, we describe the use of layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer to control the interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP) for the preparation of polyamide (PA) membrane. The dense surface of LDH layer and its unique mass transfer behavior influence the diffusion of PIP, and the supporting role of the LDH layer allows the formation of ultrathin PA membranes. By only changing the concentration of PIP, a series of membranes with controllable thickness from 10 to 50&#8197;nm and tunable crosslinking&#8208;degree can be prepared. The membrane prepared with a higher concentration of PIP shows excellent performance for divalent salt retention with water permeance of 28&#8197;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1, high rejection of 95.1&#8201;% for MgCl2 and 97.1&#8201;% for Na2SO4. While the membrane obtained with a lower concentration of PIP can sieve dye molecules of different sizes with a flux of up to 70&#8201;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the controllable preparation of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes and provides new insights into how the intermediate layer affects the IP reaction and the final separation performance.

         <title>Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized Terthiophene Redox Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although main group redox systems are attractive as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, achieving high cell voltages via extreme redox couples typically compromises their long&#8208;term stabilities. We show that phosphine oxide functionalization can render terthiophenes robust two&#8208;electron acceptors at very low potentials, thus opening fundamentally new parameter space in the search for stable main group redox systems with high cell voltages.







Abstract
Main group systems capable of undergoing controlled redox events at extreme potentials are elusive yet highly desirable for a range of organic electronics applications including use as energy storage media. Herein we describe phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophenes that exhibit two reversible 1e&#8722; reductions at potentials below &#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+ (Fc=ferrocene) while retaining high degrees of stability. A phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophene radical anion was synthesized in which the redox&#8208;responsive nature of the platform was established using combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterization. Straightforward structural modification led to the identification of a derivative that exhibits exceptional stability during bulk 2&#8201;e&#8722; galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling and enabled characterization of a 2&#8201;e&#8722; redox series. A new multi&#8208;electron redox system class is hence disclosed that expands the electrochemical cell potential range achievable with main group electrolytes without compromising stability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Analysis of the S&#8208;Glycosylation Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Lincosamide Antibiotics</title>

The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of ergothioneine, 1, into secondary metabolites. The structure and function analysis of LmbT provided a structural basis for the SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with ergothioneine. These findings will lead to the mechanistic understanding of key enzyme reactions in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine&#8208;containing natural products such as lincomycin&#8197;A.







Abstract
The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT, involved in the biosynthesis of lincomycin&#8197;A, is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic incorporation of rare amino acid L&#8208;ergothioneine (EGT) into secondary metabolites. Here, we show the structure and function analyses of LmbT. Our in vitro analysis of LmbT revealed that the enzyme shows promiscuous substrate specificity toward nitrogenous base moieties in the generation of unnatural nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)&#8208;D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;lincosamides. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of LmbT in its apo form and in complex with substrates indicated that the large conformational changes of the active site occur upon binding of the substrates, and that EGT is strictly recognized by salt&#8208;bridge and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with Arg260 and Trp101, respectively. The structure of LmbT in complex with its substrates, the docking model with the EGT&#8208;S&#8208;conjugated lincosamide, and the structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis analysis revealed the structural details of the LmbT&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with EGT.

         <title>Carrier Protein Mediated Formation of the Dihydropyridazinone Ring in Actinopyridazinone Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinopyridazinone biosynthesis represents a unique biochemical transformation of an amino acid. It involves N&#947;&#8208;amination of DABA using alanine as a nitrogen donor. An acetyl hydrazone intermediate undergoes an unprecedented carrier protein mediated heterocyclization to give a dihydropyridazinone. This is a sophisticated biosynthetic strategy in which an acetylation temporarily protects the reactive hydrazone during biosynthesis.







Abstract
Heterocycles with nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bonds are privileged building blocks of synthetic drugs. They are also found in natural products, although the biosynthetic logic behind them is poorly understood. Actinopyridazinones produced by Streptomyces sp. MSD090630SC&#8208;05 possess unique dihydropyridazinone rings that have been studied as core nuclei in several approved synthetic therapeutics. Herein, we performed gene knockouts and in vitro biochemical experiments to elucidate the major steps in actinopyridazinone biosynthesis, including the unprecedented carrier protein mediated machinery for dihydropyridazinone formation.

         <title>Discrimination of the Enantiotopic Faces of Structurally Unbiased Carbenium Ions Employing a Cyclohexadiene&#8208;Based Chiral Hydride Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cyclohexadiene&#8208;based dihydrogen surrogate can distinguish between the enantiotopic faces of benzylic carbenium ions (see Scheme). No covalent interactions are required but instead dispersion controls the facial discrimination as verified by computations.







Abstract
An enantioselective reduction of simple carbenium ions with cyclohexadienes containing a hydridic C&#8722;H bond at an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom is disclosed. The net reaction is a transfer hydrogenation of alkenes (styrenes) only employing chiral cyclohexadienes as dihydrogen surrogates. The trityl cation is used to initiate a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted process, in which a delicate intermolecular capture of a carbenium&#8208;ion intermediate by the aforementioned chiral hydride source is enantioselectivity determining. Exclusively non&#8208;covalent interactions are rendering one of the transition states energetically more favored, giving the reduction products in good enantiomeric ratios. The computed reaction mechanism supports the present findings as well as previous results obtained from studies on other transfer&#8208;hydrogenation methods involving the cyclohexadiene platform.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine 1&#8208;Imines via RuII/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Cyclization</title>

Enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization of sulfondiimines with sulfoxonium ylides using a RuII catalyst and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, thus expanding the accessible chemical space of chiral hexavalent organosulfur scaffolds relevant to biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are diaza&#8208;analogues of sulfones with a chiral sulfur center. Compared to sulfones and sulfoximines, their synthesis and transformations have so far been studied to a lesser extent. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, i.e., cyclic sulfondiimine derivatives from sulfondiimines and sulfoxonium ylides via C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization reactions. The combination of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid is key to achieving high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Sculponin&#8197;U through a Photoinduced Radical Cascade Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a C20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid, was completed. The hexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton was strategically established by a photoinduced electron transfer, generating a cationic radical intermediate from a silyl enolate.







Abstract
We have accomplished the total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a polycyclic C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid featuring a 7,20&#8208;lactone&#8208;hemiketal bridge, through a radical cascade cyclization triggered by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of a silyl enolate to form the cyclohexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton. Other key points in our synthetic strategy encompass a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to construct the middle six&#8208;membered ring of sculponin&#8197;U, and an intramolecular radical cyclization induced by iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer to close the western cyclohexane ring. Successful preparation of the enantiopure silyl enolate as the PET precursor enables the asymmetric total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, opening a new avenue for divergent syntheses of structurally related C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane congeners and pharmaceutical derivatives thereof.

         <title>Profiling Phosphoproteome Landscape in Circulating Extracellular Vesicles from Microliters of Biofluids through Functionally Tunable Paramagnetic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle to phosphoproteins (EVTOP) as a novel strategy achieves one&#8208;pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides starting with microliters of biofluids, enabling ultrasensitive EV phosphoproteome analyses of challenging biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with limited volume.







Abstract
Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease&#8208;relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one&#8208;pot extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation, extraction, and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only a trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with TiIV ions and a membrane&#8208;penetrating peptide, octa&#8208;arginine R8+, which also provides the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on&#8208;bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to TiIV ion&#8208;only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra&#8208;sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500&#8197;unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1200&#8197;phosphopeptides with 100&#8197;&#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We explored its clinical application of monitoring the outcome of chemotherapy of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients with a small volume of CSF, presenting a powerful tool for broad clinical applications.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Free, Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Free and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Saturated Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a powerful complement to existing organic amine catalysis, direct activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of saturated cyclic ketones is realized for the first time in an amine&#8208;free and directing&#8208;group&#8208;free catalytic mode. The carbonyl group binds to a defect site of the quantum dot (QD) surface, selectively weakening the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, instead of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, and exclusively generating an &#945;&#8208;C radical under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This unique activation platform leads to selective activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic ketones under redox&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
The activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones typically requires an amine and a directing group to guide the reaction selectivity in amine&#8208;catalysis carbonyl chemistry. For an &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of ketone, directing groups are also required to control the reaction selectivity. Reported herein is the first &#945;&#8208;alkylation of cyclic ketones in the absence of an amine catalyst and directing group. 1H&#8197;NMR, XPS, EPR studies and DFT calculations indicate that an &#945;&#8208;carbon radical intermediate is formed through direct and selective activation of the inert &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones chelating on the surface of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). Such an interaction is essential for weakening the C&#8722;H bond, as exemplified, using CdSe QDs as the sole photocatalyst to execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of cyclic ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Without an amine catalyst and directing group, the high step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy transformation under redox&#8208;neutral condition opens a new way for &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of ketones in carbonyl chemistry.

         <title>Amplified Chirality Transfer to Aromatic Molecules through Non&#8208;specific Inclusion by Amorphous, Hyperbranched Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active, hyperbranched poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives have been shown to include aromatic small molecules in their interior space. These small molecules form liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;like intermolecular arrangements and exhibit clear circular dichroism and efficient circularly polarized luminescence with remarkably amplified anisotropy.







Abstract
Optically active, hyperbranched, poly(fluorene&#8208;2,4,7&#8208;triylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) [poly(fluorenevinylene)] derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the fluorene backbone at various ratios acted as a chirality donor (host polymers) efficiently included naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 9,10&#8208;diphenyanthracene as a chirality acceptor (guest molecules) in their interior space in film as well as in solution, with the guest molecules exhibiting intense circular dichroism through chirality transfer with chirality amplification. The efficiency of the chirality transfer was much higher with higher&#8208;molar&#8208;mass polymers than lower&#8208;molar&#8208;mass ones as well as with hyperbranched polymers compared to the analogous linear ones. The hyperbranched polymers include the small molecules in their complex structure without any specific interactions at various stoichiometries. The included molecules may have ordered intermolecular arrangement that may be somewhat similar to those of liquid crystals. Naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene included in the polymer exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence, where the chirality was remarkably amplified in excited states, and anthracene exhibited especially high anisotropies in the emission on the order of 10&#8722;2.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Area Determination of Anisotropic Polymersomes by Amphiphilic Molecular Probe Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular probe loading method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method relies on the loading of an amphiphilic molecular probe onto the PEG corona of polymersomes as a monolayer. The surface area of anisotropic polymersomes is determined by the loading amount of probes.







Abstract
The surface area of anisotropic polymeric assemblies is a critical parameter concerning their properties. However, it is still a grand challenge for traditional techniques to determine the surface area. Here, a molecular probe loading (MPL) method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method uses an amphiphilic molecular probe, comprising hydrophobic pyrene as the anchor and hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol (EG4) as the float. The surface area of spherical polymersomes determined by dynamic light scattering is quantitatively correlated with the loading amount of probes, allowing the calculation of the average separation distance between the loaded probes. With the separation distance, we successfully determine the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes by measuring the loading amount. We envision that the MPL method will assist in the real&#8208;time surface area characterization, enabling the customization of functions.

         <title>Elucidating the Structures of Intermediate Fragments during Stepwise Dissociation of Monolayer&#8208;Protected Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry, combined with theoretical calculations, is used to resolve the structures of intermediate fragments produced upon dissociation of atomically precise silver clusters in the gas&#8208;phase, which has remained challenging using other methodologies.







Abstract
Fragmentation dynamics of ligated coinage metal clusters reflects their structural and bonding properties. So far methodological challenges limited probing structures of the fragments. Herein, we resolve the geometric structures of the primary fragments of [Ag29L12]3&#8722;, i.e. [Ag24L9]2&#8722;, [Ag19L6]&#8722; and [Ag5L3]&#8722; (L is 1,3&#8208;benzene dithiolate). For this, we used trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry to determine collision cross sections of the fragments and compared them to structures calculated by density functional theory. We also report that following two sequential [Ag5L3]&#8722; elimination steps, further dissociation of [Ag19L6]&#8722; also involves a new channel of Ag2 loss and Ag&#8722;S and C&#8722;S bond cleavages. This reflects a competition between retaining the electronic stability of 8&#8201;e&#8722; superatom cluster cores and increasing steric strain of ligands and staples.

     alt="Elucidating the Structures of Intermediate Fragments during Stepwise Dissociation of Monolayer-Protected Silver Clusters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry, combined with theoretical calculations, is used to resolve the structures of intermediate fragments produced upon dissociation of atomically precise silver clusters in the gas-phase, which has remained challenging using other methodologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation dynamics of ligated coinage metal clusters reflects their structural and bonding properties. So far methodological challenges limited probing structures of the fragments. Herein, we resolve the geometric structures of the primary fragments of [Ag&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. [Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, [Ag&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (L is 1,3-benzene dithiolate). For this, we used trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry to determine collision cross sections of the fragments and compared them to structures calculated by density functional theory. We also report that following two sequential [Ag&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; elimination steps, further dissociation of [Ag&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; also involves a new channel of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss and Ag&#8722;S and C&#8722;S bond cleavages. This reflects a competition between retaining the electronic stability of 8&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; superatom cluster cores and increasing steric strain of ligands and staples. These results are also of potential interest for future soft-landing deposition studies aimed at probing catalytic behavior of Ag clusters on supports.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;stage Transformations of a Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Perturbing Crystals to Glass&#8208;Forming Liquids that Re&#8208;Crystallize at High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first MOF glass composed of metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units is vitrified by multi&#8208;stage transformations: The crystalline MOF is amorphized by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration, goes through a glass transition to enter a super&#8208;cooled liquid state, and recrystallizes into the initial structure. These multi&#8208;stage transformations are a rare example of high&#8208;temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Glassy and liquid state metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging type of materials subjected to intense research for their rich physical and chemical properties. In this report, we obtained the first glassy MOF that involves metal&#8208;carboxylate cluster building units via multi&#8208;stage structural transformations. This MOF is composed of linear [Mn3(COO)6] node and flexible pyridyl&#8208;ethenylbenzoic linker. The crystalline MOF was first perturbed by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration to give an amorphous state, which can go through a glass transition at 505&#8197;K into a super&#8208;cooled liquid. The super&#8208;cooled liquid state is stable through a wide temperature range of 40&#8197;K and has the largest fragility index of 105, giving a broad processing window. Remarkably, the super&#8208;cooled liquid can not only be quenched into glass, but also recrystallize into the initial MOF when heated to a higher temperature above 558&#8197;K. The mechanism of the multi&#8208;stage structural transformations was studied by systematic characterizations of in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, calorimetry, rheological, spectroscopic and pair&#8208;distribution function analysis. These multi&#8208;stage transformations not only represent a rare example of high temperature coordinative recognition and self&#8208;assembly, but also provide new MOF processing strategy through crystal&#8208;amorphous&#8208;liquid&#8208;crystal transformations.

         <title>Hybrid Improper Ferroelectricity in Columnar (NaY)MnMnTi4O12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In columnar order quadrupole perovskites A2A&#8242;A&#8242;&#8242;B4O12 hybrid improper ferroelectricity emerges through A&#8208;site cation ordering across anti&#8208;displaced structural columns. This novel form of polar order couples to an intrinsic proper ferroelectric instability associated with underbonded magnetic A&#8242; Mn2+ ions, giving rise to a biased, asymmetric switching response under applied electric field that coexists at low temperature with antiferromagnetism.







Abstract
We show that cation ordering on A site columns, oppositely displaced via coupling to B site octahedral tilts, results in a polar phase of the columnar perovskite (NaY)MnMnTi4O12. This scheme is similar to hybrid improper ferroelectricity found in layered perovskites, and can be considered a realisation of hybrid improper ferroelectricity in columnar perovskites. The cation ordering is controlled by annealing temperature and when present it also polarises the local dipoles associated with pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller active Mn2+ ions to establish an additional ferroelectric order out of an otherwise disordered dipolar glass. Below TN&#8776;12&#8197;K, Mn2+ spins order, making the columnar perovskites rare systems in which ordered electric and magnetic dipoles may reside on the same transition metal sublattice.

         <title>Assembling a Heterobimetallic Actinide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by a Reaction&#8208;Induced Preorganization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 29, July 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unique architecture of the largest&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thorium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), a second actinide, uranyl, with dintinct coordination behaviour was successfully assembled into the framework via a novel reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy to yield a rare single crystalline heterobimetallic actinide MOF.







Abstract
Periodically arranging coordination&#8208;distinct actinides into one crystalline architecture is intriguing but of great synthetic challenge. We report a rare example of a heterobimetallic actinide metal&#8211;organic framework (An&#8208;MOF) by a unique reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy. A thorium MOF (SCU&#8208;16) with the largest unit cell among all Th&#8208;MOFs was prepared as the precursor, then the uranyl was precisely embedded into the MOF precursor under oxidation condition. Single crystal of the resulting thorium&#8208;uranium MOF (SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U) shows that a uranyl&#8208;specific site was in situ induced by the formate&#8208;to&#8208;carbonate oxidation reaction. The heterobimetallic SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U exhibits multifunction catalysis properties derived from two distinct actinides. The strategy proposed here offers a new avenue to create mixed&#8208;actinide functional material with unique architecture and versatile functionality.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the MacLachlan group at the University of British Columbia. They recently published an article on the uniform growth of a metal&#8211;organic framework, ZIF&#8208;8, on the surface of individual cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). After the ZIF&#8208;8/CNC fibers had been coated with a microporous organic polymer, the ZIF&#8208;8 was removed to leave a microporous polymer with CNCs encapsulated in a ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle architecture. This material proved to be effective for CO2 fixation. &#8220;Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8 on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers&#8221;, K.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Communication Along a Scaffolded Nanoscale Array of Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relaying conformational change over several nanometers is central to the function of allosterically regulated proteins. Replicating this mechanism artificially would provide important communication tools, but requires nanometer&#8208;sized molecules that reversibly switch between defined shapes in response to signaling molecules. In this work, 1.8 nm long rigid rod oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)s are scaffolds for switchable multi&#8208;squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bond relays. Each relay can adopt either a parallel or an antiparallel orientation relative to the scaffold; the preferred orientation is dictated by a director group at one end. An amine director responded to proton signals, with acid&#8208;base cycles producing multiple reversible changes in relay orientation that were reported by a terminal NH, which is 1.8 nm distant. Moreover, a chemical fuel acted as a dissipative signal. As the fuel was consumed, the relay reverted to its original orientation, illustrating how information from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium molecular signals can be communicated to a distant site.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic Synthesis: Concepts and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis is the conversion of electrical energy into value&#8208;added chemicals via a biocatalyst. Bioelectrosynthetic methods utilize the specificity and selectivity of biocatalytic enzymatic or microbial species to carry out chemical redox transformations while utilizing electricity as a stoichiometric redox equivalent. As a merging of biocatalysis and electrocatalysis, these methods directly address challenges in green and sustainable synthesis of pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, fuels, feedstocks and fertilizers. Despite the rising importance of bioelectrochemical transformations across these industries, there remains a high barrier for adoption due to the specialized experimental setups and domain knowledge for bioelectrocatalysis. This review aims to introduce the key concepts and design features of bioelectrosynthetic systems. A tutorial on the methods of biocatalyst utilization and the setup of bioelectrosynthetic cells is provided, as well as an overview of the analytical methods used for assessing bioelectrocatalysts. Key studies illustrating the vital applications of bioelectrosynthesis are outlined, such as ammonia production, small&#8208;molecule synthesis, and multi&#8208;carbon product formation. Finally, we address future directions for both microbial and enzymatic electrosynthetic methods. In summary, this review provides a critically necessary introduction to the field and a collection of resources for the non&#8208;specialist interested in pursuing a research program in bioelectrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Compression Revealed at the ~1 nm Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lattice tuning at the ~1 nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified. Through ligand induction, we herein achieve the lattice compression in a ~1 nm gold nanocluster for the first time, as detected by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8211;ray crystallography. In a freshly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 (CHT = S&#8208;c&#8208;C6H11) nanocluster, the lattice distance of the (110) facet is found to be compressed from 4.51 to 3.58 &#197; at the near end. However, the lattice distances of the (111) and (100) facets show no change in different positions. The lattice&#8208;compressed nanocluster exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) compared to that exhibited by the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 (TBBT = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzenethiolate) nanocluster and larger Au nanocrystals without lattice variation, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters. Further theoretical calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>[2+2+1+1] Cycloaddition for de novo Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique benzannulation strategy for regioselective de novo synthesis of densely functionalized phenols is described. Through metal&#8208;mediated formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO, a series of densely functionalized phenols were obtained. The benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation up to five different substituents on a phenol ring. The resulting phenols have a substitution pattern different from those obtained from D&#246;tz and Danheiser benzannulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Modulated 1,3&#8208;Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Carboboration of Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While chain&#8208;walking stimulates wide interest in both polymerization and organic synthesis, site&#8208; and stereoselective control of chain&#8208;walking on rings is still a challenging task in the realm of organometallic catalysis. Inspired by a controllable chain&#8208;walking on cyclohexane rings in olefin polymerization, we have developed a set of chain&#8208;walking carboborations of cyclcohexenes based on nickel catalysis. Different from the 1,4&#8208;trans&#8208;selectivity disclosed in polymer science, a high level of 1,3&#8208;regio&#8208; and cis&#8208;stereoselectivity is obtained in our reactions. Mechanistically, we discovery that the base affects the reduction ability of B2pin2 and different bases lead to different catalytic cycles and different regioselective products (1,2&#8208; Vs 1,3&#8208;addition). This study provides a concise and modular method for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexylboron compounds. The incorporation of a readily modifiable boronate group greatly enhances the value of this method, the synthetic potential of which was highlighted by the synthesis of a series of high&#8208;valued commercial chemicals and pharmaceutically interesting molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Ni(Co)&#8208;Ru&#8208;P Sites Activate Dehydrogenation for Hydrazine Oxidation Assisting Self&#8208;powered H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis for H2 production is restricted by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), using thermodynamically more favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has attracted ever&#8208;growing attention. Herein, we report a twisted NiCoP nanowire arrays immobilized with Ru single atoms (Ru1&#8208;NiCoP) as superior bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), realizing an ultralow working potential of &#8208;60 mV and overpotential of 32 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Inspiringly, two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer based on overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) demonstrates outstanding activity with a record&#8208;high current density of 522 mA cm&#8208;2 at cell voltage of 0.3 V.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Water electrolysis for H2 production is restricted by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), using thermodynamically more favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has attracted ever-growing attention. Herein, we report a twisted NiCoP nanowire arrays immobilized with Ru single atoms (Ru1-NiCoP) as superior bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), realizing an ultralow working potential of -60 mV and overpotential of 32 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Inspiringly, two-electrode electrolyzer based on overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) demonstrates outstanding activity with a record-high current density of 522 mA cm-2 at cell voltage of 0.3 V. DFT calculations elucidate the cooperative Ni(Co)-Ru-P sites in Ru1-NiCoP optimize H* adsorption, and enhance adsorption of *N2H2 to significantly lower the energy barrier for hydrazine dehydrogenation. Moreover, a self-powered H2 production system utilizing OHzS device driven by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) achieve a satisfactory rate of 24.0 mol h&#8722;1 m-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Paramagnetic Compass Based on Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroscopic compass&#8208;like magnetic alignment at low magnetic fields is natural for ferromagnetic materials but is seldomly observed in paramagnetic materials. Herein, we report a&#160; "paramagnetic compass" that magnetically aligns under ~mT fields based on the single&#8208;crystalline framework constructed by lanthanide ions and organic ligands (Ln&#8208;MOF). The magnetic alignment is attributed to the Ln&#8208;MOF's strong macroscopic anisotropy, where the highly&#8208;ordered structure allows the Ln&#8208;ions' molecular anisotropy to be summed according to the crystal symmetry. In tetragonal Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignment is either parallel or perpendicular to the field depending on the easiest axis of the molecular anisotropy. Reversible switching between the two alignments is realized upon the removal and re&#8208;adsorption of solvent molecules filled in the framework. When the crystal symmetry is lowered in monoclinic Ln&#8208;MOFs, the alignments become even inclined (47&#176;~66&#176;) to the field. These fascinating properties of Ln&#8208;MOFs would encourage further explorations of framework materials containing paramagnetic centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Double Perovskite Derived Halides Based on Bi and Alkali Metals (K, Rb): Diverse Structures, Tunable Optical Properties and Second Harmonic Generation Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double perovskites (DP) have attracted extensive attention due to their rich structures and wide application prospects in the field of optoelectronics. Here, we report 15 new Bi&#8208;based double perovskite derived halides with the general formula of A2BBiX6 (A = organic cationic ligand, B = K or Rb, X = Br or I). These materials are synthesized using organic ligands to coordinate with metal ions with a sp3 oxygen, and diverse structure types were obtained with distinct dimensionalities and connectivity modes. The optical band gaps of these phases can be tuned by changing the halide, the organic ligand and the alkali metal, varying from 2.0 to 2.9 eV. The bromide phases exhibit increasing photoluminescence (PL) intensity with decreasing temperature, while the PL intensity of iodide phases changes nonmonotonically with temperature. Because the majority of these phases are non&#8208;centrosymmetric, second harmonic generation (SHG) responses are also measured for selected non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, showing different particle&#8208;size&#8208;dependent trends. Our findings give rise to a series of new structural types to the DP family, and provide a powerful synthetic handle for symmetry breaking.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Photochemical Deracemization via Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon irradiation in the presence of a suitable chiral catalyst, racemic compound mixtures can be converted into enantiomerically pure compounds with the same constitution. The process is called photochemical deracemization and involves the formation of shortlived, achiral intermediates. By opening different reaction channels for the forward reaction to the intermediate and for the re&#8208;constitution of the chiral molecule, the entropically disfavored process becomes feasible. Since the discovery of the first photochemical deracemization in 2018, the field has been growing rapidly. This review comprehensively covers the research performed in the area and discusses current developments. It is subdivided according to the mode of action and the respective substrate classes. The focus of this review is on the scope of the individual reactions and on a discussion of the mechanistic details underlying the presented reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerization Induced Microphase Separation for the Fabrication of Nanostructured Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed from at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nano&#8208;scale materials with the highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11 years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence&#8208;based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process to nonexperts, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.</dc:description>
