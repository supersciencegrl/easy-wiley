         <title>Rational Design of a Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescent Probe for Human Cytochrome P450 3A and the Visualization of Mechanism&#8208;Based Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI) can mediate adverse reactions and hepatotoxicity from drugs, which is a result of their conversion into highly reactive metabolites catalyzed by enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). In the present research, we optimized the key interaction domain of the fluorophore with the target protein&#160;to develop a two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe for&#160;CYP3A enzymes&#160;that are involved in the metabolism of more than half of all clinical drugs. The developed  BN&#8208;1  &#160;probe exhibited appropriate selectivity and sensitivity for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection and imaging of endogenous CYP3A activity in various living systems, thereby providing a high&#8208;throughput screening system enabling evaluation of MBI&#8208;associated hepatotoxicity by CYP3A. Using  BN&#8208;1  &#160;as a fluorescent molecular tool facilitates the efficient discovery and characterization of CYP3A&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing A New Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 Inspired by the Phase Transition of the BaB2O4 (BBO) Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetry (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4 to uncover a new NCS chalcogenide, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 which exhibits well&#8208;balanced nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matchable second harmonic generation (SHG) response (0.6&#215;AgGaS2) and wide transparent window (0.5&#8211;25&#8197;&#956;m). These performances indicate that &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 is a promising IR NLO crystal.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals play a significant role in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing a new IR NLO crystal remains a huge challenge because of the unpredictability of inorganic structures. Herein, inspired by phase transformation of the famous BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal, a temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetric (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4 to uncover a new NCS ternary chalcogenide, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 which can exhibit the well&#8208;balanced NLO properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matching SHG response (&#8776;0.6&#215;AgGaS2), high LDT (10&#215;AgGaS2), and large birefringence (&#916;n=0.18 in the visible region). Therefore, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 will be a promising IR NLO crystal. The analysis for the structure&#8208;property relationship shows that the excellent NLO properties of &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 mainly originate from edge&#8208;sharing GaSe4 tetrahedral chains, which are different from B3O6 groups in &#946;&#8208;BBO and respect a new direction for the design of IR NLO crystals. So, we believe that the current research provides not only a new IR NLO crystal but also some insights for the design of new IR NLO crystals.

         <title>Template&#8208;directed Synthesis of Bivalent, Broad&#8208;spectrum Hosts for Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of bivalent water soluble calix[4]arene and calix[5]arene hosts,&#160;Super&#8208;sCx4&#160;and&#160;Super&#8208;sCx5&#160;as new broad&#8208;spectrum supramolecular binders of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Synthesis was achieved using the target bisquaternary amine NMBAs as a template to link two highly anionic&#160;p&#8208;sulfonatocalixarene building blocks&#160;in aqueous solution. Bivalent anionic hosts&#160;Super&#8208;sCx4&#160;and&#160;Super&#8208;sCx5&#160;bind by engaging both quaternary amines present on a variety of NMBAs. We report low&#160;&#956;M binding to structurally diverse alkyl, steroidal, curarine and benzylisoquinoline NMBAs with high selectivity over the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a variety of other hydrophobic amines.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bright, Renal&#8208;Clearable NIR&#8208;II Brush Macromolecular Probe with Long Blood Circulation Time for Kidney Disease Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early detection of kidney disease is of vital importance due to their current prevalence worldwide. Fluorescence imaging, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has been regarded as a promising technique for the early diagnosis of kidney disease due to the superior resolution and sensitivity. However, the reported NIR&#8208;II organic renal&#8208;clearable probes are hampered by their low brightness (&#949;  max  &#934;  f&gt;1000 nm  &lt; 10 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) and limited blood circulation time (  t  1/2  &lt; 2 h), which impede the targeted imaging performance. Herein, we develop the aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) brush macromolecular probes (Fudan BDIPY Probes (  FBP 912  )) with high brightness (&#949;  max  &#934;  f&gt;1000 nm  ~ 60 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ), which is about 10&#8208;fold higher than that of previously reported NIR&#8208;II renal&#8208;clearable probes.  FBP 912  exhibits an average diameter of ~ 4 nm and high renal clearance efficiency (~65% excretion through the kidney within 12 h), showing superior performance for non&#8208;invasively diagnosis of renal ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (RIR) earlier than clinical serum&#8208;based protocols. Additionally, the high molecular weight polymer brush enables  FBP 912  with prolonged circulation time (  t  1/2  ~ 6.1 h) and higher brightness than traditional PEGylated renal&#8208;clearable control fluorophores (  t  1/2  &lt; 2 h), facilitating for 4T1 tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and extended retention time.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photoswitching between Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence by Manipulating Excited State Dynamics in Molecular Aggregate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence pathways in organic molecular aggregate remains a challenge due to the complicated singlet&#8208;triplet excited state dynamics process. Herein, we demonstrated a successful example (o&#8208;BFT) to realize photoreversible fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching based on an effective strategy of integrating a phosphor (dibenzofuran) with a photoswitch (dithienylbenzothiophene). o&#8208;BFT exhibited dual emission of fluorescence and RTP in both powder and doping polymer film. Notably, the long&#8208;lived RTP of o&#8208;BFT could be repeatedly erased and restored through reversible photocyclization and decyclization under alternate ultraviolet and visible photoirradiation. In&#8208;depth theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that the triplet inactivation was dominated by a photo&#8208;controlled triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from light&#8208;activated o&#8208;BFT to photoisomer c&#8208;BFT. Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence&#8208;RTP switching.</dc:description>

In-depth theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that the triplet inactivation was dominated by a photo-controlled triplet-to-singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from light-activated o-BFT to photoisomer c-BFT. Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence-RTP switching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Wrapped Multiple Resonance Fluorophors for Suppression of Concentration Quenching and Spectrum Broadening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically wrapped multiple resonance (MR) dopants with the MR&#8208;core sandwiched by bulk substituents have been developed to suppress molecular interactions, realizing organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3&#8211;37.2&#8201;%, identical small FWHMs of 24&#8197;nm and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;20&#8197;wt&#8201;%).







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) emitters are promising for highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrowband emission; however, they still face intractable challenges with concentration&#8208;caused emission quenching, exciton annihilation, and spectral broadening. In this study, sterically wrapped MR dopants with a fluorescent MR core sandwiched by bulk substituents were developed to address the intractable challenges by reducing intermolecular interactions. Consequently, high photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields of &#8805;90&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of &#8804;25&#8197;nm over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;20&#8197;wt&#8201;%) were recorded. In addition, we demonstrated that the sandwiched MR emitter can effectively suppress Dexter interaction when doped in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer, eliminating exciton loss through dopant triplet. Within the above dopant concentration range, the optimal emitter realizes remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3&#8211;37.2&#8201;%, identical small FWHMs of 24&#8197;nm, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs in OLEDs.

         <title>Transport of Molecular Cargo by Interaction with Virus&#8208;Like Particle RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of intercalating dyes such as thiazole orange (TO) to polynucleotides allows for a simple method to load RNA&#8208;rich virus&#8208;like particles with molecular cargo, and then to release that cargo by diffusion. TO&#8208;labeled molecules come out much slower than they go in because of the high RNA concentration inside the shell; the surprise is how much cargo these easily produced nanocontainers can carry.







Abstract
Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) derived from Leviviridae virions contain substantial amounts of cellular and plasmid&#8208;derived RNA. This encapsidated polynucleotide serves as a reservoir for the efficient binding of the intercalating dye thiazole orange (TO). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and oligopeptides of varying length, end&#8208;functionalized with TO, were loaded into VLPs up to approximately 50&#8201;% of the mass of the capsid protein (hundreds to thousands of cargo molecules per particle, depending on size). The kinetics of TO&#8211;PEG binding included a significant entropic cost for the reptation of long chains through the capsid pores. Cargo molecules were released over periods of 20&#8211;120&#8197;hours following simple reversible first&#8208;order kinetics in most cases. These observations define a simple general method for the noncovalent packaging, and subsequent release, of functional molecules inside nucleoprotein nanocages in a manner independent of modifications to the capsid protein.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling Is Unlikely to Be the Rate&#8208;Determining Step in the Formation of C2+ Products in the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Reduction of CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetic and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopic results indicate that the C&#8722;C coupling is unlikely to be the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the formation of C2+ products in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction. Electrochemical hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water as the proton donor is proposed as the RDS.







Abstract
The identity of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu catalysts remains unresolved because: 1)&#8197;the presence of mass transport limitation of CO; and 2)&#8197;the absence of quantitative correlation between CO partial pressure (pCO) and surface CO coverage. In this work, we determined CO adsorption isotherms on Cu in a broad pH range of 7.2&#8211;12.9. Together with electrokinetic data, we demonstrate that the reaction orders of adsorbed CO at pCO &lt;0.4 and &gt;0.6 atm are 1st and 0th, respectively, for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products on three Cu catalysts. These results indicate that the C&#8722;C coupling is unlikely to be the RDS in the formation of C2+ products in the CORR. We propose that the hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water is the RDS, and the site competition between CO and water leads to the observed transition of the CO reaction order.

         <title>An Iron(III) Superoxide Corrole from Iron(II) and Dioxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;superoxide corrole has been generated from a ferrous corrole and dioxygen, and was found to be capable of indole dioxygenation and H&#8208;atom transfer reactions.







Abstract
A new structurally characterized ferrous corrole [FeII(ttppc)]&#8722; (1) binds one equivalent of dioxygen to form [FeIII(O2&#8722;.)(ttppc)]&#8722; (2). This complex exhibits a 16/18O2&#8208;isotope sensitive &#957;(O&#8208;O) stretch at 1128&#8197;cm&#8722;1 concomitantly with a single &#957;(Fe&#8208;O2) at 555&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating it is an &#951;1&#8208;superoxo (&#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221;) iron(III) complex. Complex 2 is the first well characterized Fe&#8208;O2 corrole, and mediates the following biologically relevant oxidation reactions: dioxygenation of an indole derivative, and H&#8208;atom abstraction from an activated O&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Moderate Surface Segregation Promotes Selective Ethanol Production in CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction over CoCu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is described for theory&#8208;based catalyst optimization of CoCu alloys in CO2 hydrogenation. Moderate Co surface segregation, boosted ethanol production, and suppressed methane generation suggest that theory&#8208;guided catalyst optimization could be beneficial in similar alloy systems.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;copper (CoCu) catalysts have industrial potential in CO/CO2 hydrogenation reactions, and CoCu alloy has been elucidated as a major active phase during reactions. However, due to elemental surface segregation and dealloying phenomena, the actual surface morphology of CoCu alloy is still unclear. Combining theory and experiment, the dual effect of surface segregation and varied CO coverage over the CoCu(111) surface on the reactivity in CO2 hydrogenation reactions is explored. The relationship between C&#8722;O bond scission and further hydrogenation of intermediate *CH2O was discovered to be a key step to promote ethanol production. The theoretical investigation suggests that moderate Co segregation provides a suitable surface Co ensemble with lateral interactions of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO, leading to promoted selectivity to ethanol, in agreement with theory&#8208;inspired experiments.

&lt;p&gt;A method is described for theory-based catalyst optimization of CoCu alloys in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. Moderate Co surface segregation, boosted ethanol production, and suppressed methane generation suggest that theory-guided catalyst optimization could be beneficial in similar alloy systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt-copper (CoCu) catalysts have industrial potential in CO/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation reactions, and CoCu alloy has been elucidated as a major active phase during reactions. However, due to elemental surface segregation and dealloying phenomena, the actual surface morphology of CoCu alloy is still unclear. Combining theory and experiment, the dual effect of surface segregation and varied CO coverage over the CoCu(111) surface on the reactivity in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation reactions is explored. The relationship between C&#8722;O bond scission and further hydrogenation of intermediate *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was discovered to be a key step to promote ethanol production. The theoretical investigation suggests that moderate Co segregation provides a suitable surface Co ensemble with lateral interactions of co-adsorbed *CO, leading to promoted selectivity to ethanol, in agreement with theory-inspired experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Polyrotaxane Monolayer with Emergent and Steerable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional chiral polyrotaxane monolayer with circularly polarized luminescent activity was fabricated by utilizing cyclodextrins as chiral wheels and 2D dynamic covalent organic frameworks as luminescent polymeric axles through a combined strategy of one&#8208;pot host&#8211;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Here, we propose a mechanically interlocked strategy to achieve a 2D chiral polyrotaxane (2D CPR) monolayer with emergent and steerable CPL activity by utilizing &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the chiral wheel and a luminescent dynamic covalent organic framework as 2D polymeric axle. Such methodology, integrating host&#8211;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry, enabled the direct construction of a delaminated 2D CPR monolayer with extraordinarily large size (up to tens of micrometers) and simultaneously endowed chirality to the extended 2D CPR network to generate CPL activity. Importantly, not only the structure but also the CPL performance of the 2D CPR network can be further regulated by the feeding amount of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This work demonstrated a monolayered 2D CPR with CPL activity for the first time. The insightful structure&#8211;property relationship of the induced CPL will be of benefit for a deeper understanding of the excited&#8208;state chirality of 2D chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Oriented UiO&#8208;67 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane with Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along the [022] direction, results in more interconnected trans&#8208;membrane channels for ion transport, shows ultrahigh Li+ ion permeability and excellent Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. The ultrahigh Li+/Mg2+ selectivity is associated with the difference in the energy barrier of ion transport across the membrane caused by the varying extents of partial dehydration of hydrated ions.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) membranes with high pore density and tunable pore size down to the subnanoscale exhibit great potential in ion separation when appropriately designed and prepared. By a washing&#8208;assisted secondary growing method, a well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along the [022] direction was synthesized on a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)&#8208;modified AAO substrate. Because of the oriented growth of UiO&#8208;67 nanocrystals, highly interconnected ion&#8208;transporting channels are created throughout the UiO&#8208;67/AAO membrane capable of achieving an ultrahigh Li+ permeance of 27.01&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 as well as very decent Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of up to 159.4. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high selectivity is associated with the large disparity of the transport energy barrier between Li+ and Mg2+, which is caused by different extents of ion dehydration in unique bimodal and oriented membrane channels.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Dominate Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in Zeolite SSZ&#8208;42: A Classification of Their Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a high abundance of hydrogen bonding of Br&#248;nsted acid sites. These occur mainly due to the existence of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;rings, with suitable alignment of oxygen atoms, in which the acidic bridging OH groups can interact with oxygen atoms on the opposite side of the rings. 1H NMR spectroscopic components of the acid sites overlap with coexisting defect silanol groups that are also hydrogen&#8208;bonded.







Abstract
The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a remarkable high abundance (&#8776;80&#8201;%) of hydrogen&#8208;bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), which are deshielded from the 1H chemical shift of unperturbed BAS at typically 4&#8197;ppm. This is due to their interaction with neighboring oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework when oxygen alignments are suitable. The classification and diversity of hydrogen bonding is assessed by DFT calculations, showing that oval&#8208;shaped 6&#8208;rings and 5&#8208;rings allow for a stronger hydrogen bond to oxygen atoms on the opposite ring side, yielding higher experimental chemical shifts (&#948; (1H)=6.4&#8197;ppm), than circular 6&#8208;rings (&#948;(1H)=5.2&#8197;ppm). Cage&#8208;like structures and intra&#8208;tetrahedral interactions can also form hydrogen bonds. The alignment of oxygen atoms is expected to impact their role in the stabilization of intermediates in catalytic reactions, such as surface alkoxy groups and possibly transition states.

         <title>Hierarchical, Highly Open Microtubes and Columnar Liquid Crystals Self&#8208;Assembled from Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Colloidal Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideal colloidal ring model system for self&#8208;assembly (SA) is synthesized and its SA is studied. A variety of porous colloidal superstructures from microtubes to highly open liquid crystals is achieved. Staged SA results in complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies, which, as new building blocks, further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. A plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found.







Abstract
The use of simple building blocks to produce hierarchical and porous structured materials is highly desired. Rings are simple colloidal particles but unique for their internal cavities. Here we report the self&#8208;assembly (SA) of colloidal rings with tunable asymmetry mediated by a depletion force and demonstrate that a variety of porous colloidal superstructures from microtubes, flexible chains, (plastic) crystals to highly open liquid crystals (LCs) can be formed along the predesigned SA paths. In particular, the SA is staged in binary or ternary systems. Large rings first form complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies by capturing smaller rings, which, as new building blocks, can further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. Moreover, a plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found from asymmetrical rings. The SA with colloidal rings opens a new avenue to construct hierarchical and porous ordered metamaterials.

         <title>Sequential Metal Catalysis towards 7&#8208;Oxostaurosporine and Its Non&#8208;Natural Septanose Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo synthetic method towards bioactive indolocarbazole glycoside natural products is reported. The signature event features efficient sequential metal catalysis that generates the key bicyclic intermediate. The utility of this method is demonstrated by a very short formal synthesis of natural 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine as well as by the synthesis of the non&#8208;natural septanose analogue.







Abstract
We report sequential metal catalysis towards indolocarbazole glycosides. The signature event is highlighted by i) Pd0&#8208;catalyzed addition of indolocarbazole to alkoxyallene combined with ring&#8208;closing&#8208;metathesis; ii) Ru&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective olefin migration; iii) PdII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization to build the bicyclic core structure of the target compounds. This approach gave access to both natural pyranose&#8208; and non&#8208;natural septanose glycosides. A short formal synthesis of 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine was achieved via this strategy.

     alt="Sequential Metal Catalysis towards 7-Oxostaurosporine and Its Non-Natural Septanose Analogue"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A de novo synthetic method towards bioactive indolocarbazole glycoside natural products is reported. The signature event features efficient sequential metal catalysis that generates the key bicyclic intermediate. The utility of this method is demonstrated by a very short formal synthesis of natural 7-oxostaurosporine as well as by the synthesis of the non-natural septanose analogue.
&lt;/p&gt;

Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterointerface for CO2 chemical fixation into dimethyl carbonate.







Abstract
Chemical fixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added organics is regarded as a competitive and viable method in large scale industrial production, during which the catalysts with promoting CO2 activation ability are needed. Herein, we proposed an in&#8208;plane heterostructure strategy to construct Lewis acid&#8211;base sites for efficient CO2 activation. By taking ultrathin in&#8208;plane Cu2O/Cu heterostructures as a prototype, we show that Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on heterointerface can facilitate a mixed C and O dual coordination on surface, which not only strengthen CO2 adsorption, but also effectively activate the inert molecules. As revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Lewis acid&#8208;base sites could readily activate CO2 to .CO2&#8722; species, which is the key intermediate radical for CO2 fixation. As a result, abundant Lewis acid&#8211;base sites endow Cu2O/Cu nanosheets with excellent performances for dimethyl carbonate generation, a high conversion yield of 28&#8201;% with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity under mild conditions. This study provides a model structure for CO2 fixation reactions.

         <title>Deoxygenation of Nitrous Oxide and Nitro Compounds Using Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene)Amido Iron Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient catalytic degradation of N2O to N2 by well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complexes under mild conditions involving the cooperative effect between the iron and silylene ligands is reported. Selective reductions of nitro compounds to amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity has been developed using the same approach.







Abstract
Herein, we report the efficient degradation of N2O with a well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complex as catalyst. The deoxygenation of N2O using the iron silanone complex 4 as a catalyst and pinacolborane (HBpin) as a sacrificial reagent proceeds smoothly at 50&#8201;&#176;C to form N2, H2, and (pinB)2O. Mechanistic studies suggest that the iron&#8211;silicon cooperativity is the key to this catalytic transformation, which involves N2O activation, H atom transfer, H2 release and oxygenation of the boron sites. This approach has been further developed to enable catalytic reductions of nitro compounds, producing amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Inhibitor&#8208;Mediated Structural Transition in a Minimal Amyloid Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the ultimate dipeptide that forms typical amyloid fibrils shows a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. However, when crystallized in the presence of an amyloid&#8208;inhibitor the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix).







Abstract
Despite the fundamental clinical importance of amyloid fibril formation, its mechanism is still enigmatic. Crystallography of minimal amyloid models was a milestone in the understanding of the architecture and biological activities of amyloid fibers. However, the crystal structure of ultimate dipeptide&#8208;based amyloids is not yet reported. Herein, we present the crystal structure of a typical amyloid&#8208;forming minimal dipeptide, Ac&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;NH2 (Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2), showing a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. The simplicity of the structure helped in investigating amyloid&#8208;inhibition using crystallography, never previously reported for larger peptide models. Interestingly, in the presence of an inhibitor, the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix). This study promotes our understanding of the mechanism of amyloid formation and of the structural transitions that occur during the inhibition process in a most fundamental model.

         <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of multiple molecules in mitochondria across the whole brain of freely moving animals is the key bottleneck, for understanding the physiological and pathological mechanisms of mitochondria that plays in the brain events. Here we built up a Raman fiber photometry, and created a highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe based on triple&#8208;recognition strategies of chemical reaction, charge transfer, and characteristic fingerprint peaks, for tracking and simultaneous quantitation of mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  , Ca  2+  and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal upon hypoxia. It was found that mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  , Ca  2+  and pH changed from superficial to deep brain regions upon hypoxia. It was discovered that hypoxia&#8208;induced mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  burst was regulated by ASIC1a, leading to mitochondrial Ca  2+  overload and acidification. Furthermore, we found the overload of mitochondrial Ca  2+  was almost attributed to the influx of extracellular Ca  2+  .</dc:description>

         <title>Maximizing Step&#8208;Normalized Increases in Molecular Complexity: Formal [4+2+2+2] Photoinduced Cyclization Cascade to Access Polyheterocycles Possessing Privileged Substructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new complexity building photoinduced cascade which amounts to an unprecedented formal [4+2+2+2] cycloaddition topology is developed to access complex nitrogen polyheterocycles. This photocascade is initiated by the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in aromatic amino ketones with tethered dual unsaturated pendants, i.e. pyrrole and alkenic moieties, resulting in the formation of four &#963;&#8208;bonds and setting six new stereogenic centers in a single experimentally simple photochemical step&#160;with up to 220 mcbit complexity increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Copolyester Monomers from Plant&#8208;Based Acrylate and Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PCTA is an important copolyester that has been widely used in our&#160;daily necessities. Currently, its monomers are industrially produced from petroleum&#8208;derived xylene.&#160;To reduce the reliance on fossil energy, we herein disclose an alternative route to access PCTA monomer (terephthalate/isophthalate = 2.4/1) in 61% overall yield&#160;using&#160;plant&#8208;based acrylate and acetaldehyde as the feedstocks. The process includes Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction&#160;of acetaldehyde&#160;with acrylate, subsequent one&#8208;step dehydration/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with acrylate over H2SO4/SiO2&#160;catalyst, and final Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation. Besides, when varying the final step to hydrogenation, another important monomer UNOXOL&#8482; diol&#160;(1,4&#8208;trans/1,4&#8208;cis/1,3&#8208;trans/1,3&#8208;cis&#160;= 5.2/2/2.5/1) can be produced in 67% overall yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear Extension of Anthracene via B&#8592;N &#160;Lewis Pair Formation: Effects on Optoelectronic Properties and Singlet O2 Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation offers an opportunity to judiciously fine&#8208;tune the structural features and optoelectronic properties, to suit the demands of applications in organic electronic devices, bioimaging, and as sensitizers for singlet oxygen. We demonstrate that the N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anthracene offers access to linearly extended acene derivatives Py&#8208;BR (R = Et, Ph, C6F5). In comparison to indeno&#8208;fused 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene, the formal &#8220;BN for CC&#8221; replacement in Py&#8208;BR selectively lowers the LUMO, resulting in a much reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. An even more extended conjugated system with seven six&#8208;membered rings in a row (Qu&#8208;BEt) is obtained by borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)anthracene. Fluorinated Py&#8208;BPf shows particularly advantageous properties, including low&#8208;lying HOMO and LUMO levels, strong yellow&#8208;green fluorescence, and effective singlet oxygen sensitization, while resisting self&#8208;sensitized conversion to its endoperoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective&#160;O&#8208;Glycosylations by Pyrylium Salt Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite many years of invention, the field of carbohydrate chemistry remains rather inaccessible to non&#8208;specialists, which limits the scientific impact and reach of the discoveries made in the field. Aiming to increase the availability of stereoselective glycosylation chemistry for non&#8208;specialists, we have discovered that several commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective O&#8208;glycosylations of a wide range of phenols and alkyl alcohols. This catalytic reaction utilizes trichloroacetimidates, an easily accessible and synthetically proven electrophile, takes place under air and only initiates when all three reagents are mixed, which should provide better reproducibility by non&#8208;specialists. The reaction exhibits varying degrees of stereospecificity, resulting in &#946;&#8208;selective glycosylations from &#945;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates, whilst an &#945;&#8208;selective glycosylation proceeds from &#946;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates. A mechanistic study revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via an SN2&#8208;like substitution on the protonated electrophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Orienting an Organic Semiconductor into DNA 3D Arrays by Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductor, hepta(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (HPV), was incorporated into a DNA tensegrity triangle motif using a covalent strategy. 3D arrays were self&#8208;assembled from an HPV&#8208;DNA pseudo&#8208;rhombohedron edge by rational design and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Templated by the DNA motif, HPV molecules exist as single&#8208;molecule fluorescence emitters at the concentration of 8mM within the crystal lattice. The anisotropic fluorescence emission from HPV&#8208;DNA crystals indicates HPV molecules are well aligned in the macroscopic 3D DNA lattices. Sophisticated nanodevices and functional materials constructed from DNA can be developed from this strategy by addressing functional components with molecular accuracy.</dc:description>

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of Polymerized Dioxolane as Solid Electrolyte and its Thermal Decomposition Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerized&#8208;dioxolane(P&#8208;DOL) is of potential as a solid&#8208;polymer&#8208;electrolyte(SPE) due to its high Li+&#8208;conductivity, good compatibility with Li&#8208;metal and desired preparation method of in&#8208;situ polymerization in cells. In this study, SnF2 was demonstrated not only to be an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL at room temperature, but also an effective additive for improving interfacial wettability and suppressing dendrite through the reaction with Li&#8208;metal and the formation of LiF/LixSn based composite solid electrolyte interlayer(SEI). Using the SnF2 polymerized P&#8208;DOL containing 1M LiTFSI as SPE(P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE), obviously denser Li&#8208;deposition was obtained, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) Li/LiFePO4 cell delivered stable cycling over 350 cycles at 45oC. At the same time, the irreversible decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE into formaldehyde and small molecule epoxides are observed at 110oC, which is even initiated at lower temperature of 40oC under vacuum. This thermal decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE in pouch cell causes huge volume swell, and therefore putting a strict limitation on the operating temperature window for the P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Axially Chiral Styrene&#8208;Based Organocatalysts and Their Application in Catalytic Asymmetric (2+4) Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based thiourea&#8208;tertiary amine catalysts, which have unique characteristics such as an efficient synthetic route, multiple chiral elements and multiple activating groups, has been rationally designed. These new chiral catalysts have proven to be efficient organocatalysts, enabling the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines with homophthalic anhydrides in good yields (up to 96%) with excellent stereoselectivities (all &gt;95:5 dr, up to 98% ee). More importantly, theoretical calculations elucidated the important role of axially chiral styrene moiety in controlling both the reactivity and the enantioselectivity. This work not only represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea&#8208;tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, but also gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate profiling of mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P via a site&#8208;specific photocrosslinking approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approaches for profiling protease substrates are critical for defining protease functions, but remain challenging tasks. Here we combine genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics to identify substrates of the mitochondrial (mt) human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP). Site&#8208;specific incorporation of the diazirine&#8208;bearing amino acid DiazK into the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP, followed by UV&#8208;irradiation of cells allows to covalently trap hClpP to substrate proteins and to substantiate hClpP&#8217;s major involvement in maintaining overall mt homeostasis. In addition to confirming many of the previously annotated hClpP substrates, our approach adds a diverse set of new proteins to the hClpP interactome. Importantly, our workflow allows to identify substrate dynamics upon external cues in an unbiased manner. Identification of unique hClpP&#8208;substrate proteins upon induction of mt oxidative stress, suggests that hClpP counteracts oxidative stress by processing of proteins that are involved in respiratory chain complex synthesis and maturation as well as in catabolic pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified View on Varied Ultrafast Dynamics of the Primary Process in Microbial Rhodopsins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Varied excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics observed in the primary photoreaction of microbial rhodopsins are the ground&#8208;state heterogeneity arising from the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of the amino acid residue acting as the counterion of a protonated retinal Schiff base chromophore.







Abstract
All&#8208;trans to 13&#8208;cis photoisomerization of the protonated retinal Schiff base (PRSB) chromophore is the primary step that triggers various biological functions of microbial rhodopsins. While this ultrafast primary process has been extensively studied, it has been recognized that the relevant excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics differ significantly from one rhodopsin to another. To elucidate the origin of the complicated ultrafast dynamics of the primary process in microbial rhodopsins, we studied the excited&#8208;state dynamics of proteorhodopsin, its D97N mutant, and bacteriorhodopsin by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption (TA) spectroscopy in a wide pH range. The TA data showed that their excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics drastically change when pH approaches the pKa of the counterion residue of the PRSB chromophore in the ground state. This result reveals that the varied excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics in different rhodopsins mainly originate from the difference of the ground&#8208;state heterogeneity (i.e., protonation/deprotonation of the PRSB counterion).

         <title>Cascaded Nanozyme System with High Reaction Selectivity by Substrate Screening and Channeling in a Microfluidic Device**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction selectivity of a nanozyme system was enhanced by screening and channeling of substrates. A catalytic cascade incorporating N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages with oxidase&#8208;like activity, and Prussian blue nanoparticles with peroxidase&#8208;like activity, improved reaction selectivity by more than 2000 times.







Abstract
Surpassing natural enzymes in cost, stability and mass production, nanozymes have attracted wide attention in fields from disease diagnosis to tumor therapy. However, nanozymes intrinsically have low reaction selectivity, which significantly restricts their applications. A general method is reported to address this challenge by following a biomimetic operation principle of substrates channeling and screening. Two oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymes (i.e., emerging N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages and Prussian blue nanoparticles), were cascaded as a proof of concept to improve the reaction selectivity in transforming the substrate into the targeted product by more than 2000 times. The cascaded nanozymes were also adopted to a spatially confined microfluidic device, leading to more than 100&#8208;fold enhancement of the reaction efficiency due to signal amplification.

         <title>Folding&#8208;induced Fluorescence Enhancement in a Series of Merocyanine Hetero&#8208;Folda&#8208;Trimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pronounced fluorescence enhancement could be shown for a weakly fluorescent merocyanine dye in hetero&#8208;folda&#8208;trimer architectures. This folding&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (FIFE) for specific sequences of &#960;&#8208;stacked dyes points at a viable strategy towards improved fluorophores that relates to the approach used by nature in the green fluorescent protein (GFP).







Abstract
Many dyes suffer from fast non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, thereby showing only short&#8208;lived excited states and weak photoluminescence. Here we show a pronounced fluorescence enhancement for a weakly fluorescent merocyanine (MC) dye by being co&#8208;facially stacked to other dyes in hetero&#8208;folda&#8208;trimer architectures. By means of fluorescence spectroscopy (lifetime, quantum yield) the fluorescence enhancement was explained by the rigidification of the emitting chromophore in the defined foldamer architecture and the presence of a non&#8208;forbidden lowest exciton state in H&#8208;coupled hetero&#8208;aggregates. This folding&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (FIFE) for specific sequences of &#960;&#8208;stacked dyes points at a viable strategy toward improved fluorophores that relates to the approach used by nature in the green fluorescent protein (GFP).

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) Used for Target&#8208;Specific Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Photooxygenation in an Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were devised to oxidize &#946;&#8208;amyloid spatiotemporally and noninvasively. The well&#8208;designed photocatalyst shows an inhibitory effect of A&#946; aggregation and recovery of memory deficits in triple&#8208;transgenic AD model mice upon the NIR&#8208;II irradiation.







Abstract
Phototherapy has emerged as a powerful approach for interrupting &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) self&#8208;assembly. However, deeper tissue penetration and safer photosensitizers are urgent to be exploited for avoiding damaging nearby normal tissues and improving therapeutic effectiveness. A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II photooxygenation catalyst is presented here to settle the abovementioned challenges. By encapsulating the pyridinium hemicyanine dye DSM with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;section in NIR&#8208;II window into the porphyrin&#8208;based HOF, the resultant DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 exhibits significant two&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;II&#8208;excited Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for A&#946; oxidation. Further, the target peptides of KLVFFAED (KD8) are covalently grafted on DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 to enhance the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability and A&#946; selectivity. The HOF&#8208;based photooxygenation catalyst shows an outstanding inhibitory effect of A&#946; aggregation upon the NIR&#8208;II irradiation. Further in vivo studies demonstrate the obvious decrease of craniocerebral A&#946; plaques and recovery of memory deficits in triple&#8208;transgenic AD (3&#215;Tg&#8208;AD) model mice.

By encapsulating the pyridinium hemicyanine dye DSM with a large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section in NIR-II window into the porphyrin-based HOF, the resultant DSM@n-HOF-6 exhibits significant two-photon NIR-II-excited Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to generate singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for A&#946; oxidation. Further, the target peptides of KLVFFAED (KD8) are covalently grafted on DSM@n-HOF-6 to enhance the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability and A&#946; selectivity. The HOF-based photooxygenation catalyst shows an outstanding inhibitory effect of A&#946; aggregation upon the NIR-II irradiation. Further in vivo studies demonstrate the obvious decrease of craniocerebral A&#946; plaques and recovery of memory deficits in triple-transgenic AD (3&#215;Tg-AD) model mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Pore Surface of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Synthetic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly crystalline 3D COFs with variable loadings of ethynyl groups were designed and synthesized. Remarkably, these alkyne&#8208;tagged 3D COFs provide a platform for targeted anchoring various organic groups onto the pore walls via click reactions, which can accordingly change their properties, e.g., the obtained click products exhibited higher CO2/N2 selectivity.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) have gained increasing attention for their attractive features. However, the development of 3D COFs is strongly restricted, mainly due to their synthetic difficulty and complicated structure determination. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, which can avoid these problems by incorporating functional moieties into a predetermined framework, provides an alternative way to construct 3D COFs with specific functions. Herein, we report the designed synthesis and characterization of a series of highly crystalline 3D COFs with different loadings of ethynyl groups. Notably, these alkyne&#8208;tagged 3D COFs provide a platform for targeted anchoring various specific groups onto the pore walls via click reactions. Moreover, the pore surface engineering can accordingly change their properties, for example, the obtained click products exhibited higher CO2/N2 selectivity. We describe a simple but powerful strategy to build functional 3D COFs, which will certainly advance them for a ranging of interesting applications in the future.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like well&#8208;manicured trees in nature, hyperbranched nanotrees are generated by sequential growth of multiple generations of aligned branches on the trunks, giving efficient light absorption and trapping. Likewise, in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111856), Yilong Lei et&#8197;al. develop a solution co&#8208;assembly strategy to access ordered binary and ternary hyperbranched microwires comprising arene&#8208;perfluoroarene cocrystals, which display optical waveguiding and light&#8208;harvesting abilities.

         <title>Magnetization Dynamics on Isotope&#8208;Isomorphic Holmium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear&#8208;spin driven relaxation collaborating with the ligands in lanthanide single molecule&#8208;magnets (SMMs) remains ambiguous. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112764), Liviu Ungur, Jun&#8208;Liang Liu and co&#8208;workers reported two HoIII isotopic&#8211;isomorphic SMMs, whose magnetization dynamics reveals the switch of the relative relaxation rates at low/high temperatures. Their reasonable theoretical analysis suggests that the noticeable isotope effect arises from the tunnel splitting and the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the distinct nuclear spin number of 1H and 2H.

Irradiation&#8208;wavelength directing circularly polarized luminescence in emissive self&#8208;organized helical superstructures is demonstrated by Jinbao Guo, Quan Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111344). Phototuning the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals was achieved in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch.

         <title>Virus&#8208;Mimicking Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles for Cytosolic Delivery of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are engineered to express a viral fusion protein, thus enabling them to exhibit improved endosomal escape properties. It is demonstrated that these virus&#8208;mimicking nanocarriers are able to deliver mRNA payloads to the cytosolic compartment after cellular uptake, enhancing expression of the encoded proteins both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Effective endosomal escape after cellular uptake represents a major challenge in the field of nanodelivery, as the majority of drug payloads must localize to subcellular compartments other than the endosomes in order to exert activity. In nature, viruses can readily deliver their genetic material to the cytosol of host cells by triggering membrane fusion after endocytosis. For the influenza A virus, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein found on its surface fuses the viral envelope with the surrounding membrane at endosomal pH values. Biomimetic nanoparticles capable of endosomal escape were fabricated using a membrane coating derived from cells engineered to express HA on their surface. When evaluated in&#8197;vitro, these virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles were able to deliver an mRNA payload to the cytosolic compartment of target cells, resulting in the successful expression of the encoded protein. When the mRNA&#8208;loaded nanoparticles were administered in&#8197;vivo, protein expression levels were significantly increased in both local and systemic delivery scenarios. We therefore conclude that utilizing genetic engineering approaches to express viral fusion proteins on the surface of cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles is a viable strategy for modulating the intracellular localization of encapsulated cargoes.

         <title>Concurrent Prebiotic Formation of Nucleoside&#8208;Amidophosphates and Nucleoside&#8208;Triphosphates Potentiates Transition from Abiotic to Biotic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate enabled phosphorylation chemistry facilitates the synthesis of closely related nucleotides and nucleoside triphosphates that are compatible with abiotic oligomerization, and ribozyme&#8208;mediated polymerization and ligation processes. The one&#8208;pot protocol spans nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides, implying that the progression from prebiotic chemistry to those conducive for emergence of life's biochemistry could be a relatively continuous process than previously assumed. For details see the Research Article by Ulrich&#8197;F. M&#252;ller, Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113625).

         <title>A MOF Multifunctional Cargo Vehicle for Reactive Gas Delivery and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient delivery of reactive and toxic gaseous reagents to organic reactions was studied using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Simultaneous cargo vehicle and catalytic capabilities of several MOFs were probed for the first time using the examples of&#160; aromatization, aminocarbonylation, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions. These reactions highlight that MOFs can serve a dual role as a gas cargo vehicle and a catalyst, &#160;leading to product formation with yields similar to reactions employing pure gases. Furthermore, the MOFs can be recycled without sacrificing product yield, while simultaneously maintaining crystallinity. The reported findings were supported crystallographically and spectroscopically (e.g.,&#160; diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), foreshadowing a pathway for the development of multifunctional MOF&#8208;based reagent&#8208;catalyst cargo vessels for reactive reagents, as an attractive alternative to the use of toxic pure gases or gas generators.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Analysis of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic crystals, although widely studied, have not been considered nascent candidate materials in the engineering design. Here we summarize the reported mechanical properties of organic crystals reported over the past three decades, and we establish a global mechanical property profile that can be used to predict and identify mechanically robust organic crystals. Being composed of light elements, organic crystals populate a narrow region in the mechanical property&#8208;density space between soft, disordered organic materials and stiff, ordered materials. Two subsets of extraordinarily stiff and hard organic crystalline materials were identified and rationalized by the normalized number density, strength and directionality of their intermolecular interactions. We conclude that the future light&#8208;weight, soft, all&#8208;organic components in devices should capitalize on the combination of long&#8208;range structural order and softness as the greatest asset of organic single crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Itaconation of Complex Peptides by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective peptide functionalization provides a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective access to diversify peptides for biological studies. Among many existing non&#8208;invasive peptide conjugations methodologies, photoredox catalysis has emerged as one of the powerful approaches for site&#8208;specific manipulation on native peptide. Herein, we report a highly N&#8208;termini&#8208;specific method to rapidly access itaconated peptides and their derivatives through a combination of transamination and photoredox conditions. This strategy exploits the facile reactivity of peptidyl&#8211;dihydropyridine in the complex peptide settings, complementing extant approaches of bioconjugations with excellent selectivity under mild conditions. Distinct from conventional methods, this method utilizes the highly reactive carbamoyl radical derived from a peptidyl&#8211;dihydropyridine. In addition, this itaconated peptide can be further functionalized as a Michael acceptor to access the corresponding peptide&#8211;protein conjugate.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a mechanism&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free tandem catalytic approach, commodity polyester plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are rapidly and selectively deconstructed by combining the two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)  4  and Pd/C, under 1 atm H  2  , affording terephthalic acid (or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid for PEN) and ethane (or butane for PBT) in essentially quantitative yield. This process is effective for both laboratory grade and waste plastics, and comingled polypropylene remains unchanged. Combined experimental and DFT mechanistic analyses indicate that Hf(OTf)  4  catalyzes a mildly exergonic retro&#8208;hydroalkoxylation reaction in which an alkoxy C&#8208;O bond is first cleaved, yielding a carboxylic acid and alkene, and this process is closely coupled to an exergonic olefin hydrogenation step, driving the overall reaction forward.</dc:description>

         <title>A {Ni12}&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Coordinative Binding of Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air pollutions by SO  2  and NO  2  have caused significant risks on the environment and human health. Understanding the mechanism of active sites within capture materials is of fundamental importance to the development of new clean&#8208;up technologies. Here we report the crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO  2  and NO  2  on open Ni(II) sites in a metal&#8208;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating an unprecedented {Ni  12  }&#8208;wheel, which exhibits six open Ni(II) sites on desolvation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Air pollutions by SO  2  and NO  2  have caused significant risks on the environment and human health. Understanding the mechanism of active sites within capture materials is of fundamental importance to the development of new clean-up technologies. Here we report the crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO  2  and NO  2  on open Ni(II) sites in a metal-organic framework (NKU-100) incorporating an unprecedented {Ni  12  }-wheel, which exhibits six open Ni(II) sites on desolvation. Immobilised gas molecules are further stabilised by cooperative  host-guest interactions  comprised of hydrogen bonds, &#960;  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; interactions and dipole interactions. At 298 K and 1.0 bar, NKU-100 shows adsorption uptakes of 6.21 and 5.80 mmol g  -1  for SO  2  and NO  2  , respectively. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have confirmed the selective retention of SO  2  and NO  2  at low concentrations under dry conditions. This work will inspire the future design of efficient sorbents for the capture of SO  2  and NO  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Chiral Target of Daptomycin is the 2R,2'S Stereoisomer of Phosphatidylglycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Daptomycin (dap) is an important antibiotic that interacts with the bacterial membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in a calcium&#8208;dependent manner. The enantiomer of dap (ent&#8208;dap) was synthesized and was found to be 85&#8208;fold less active than dap against B. subtilis, indicating that dap interacts with a chiral target as part of its mechanism of action. Using liposomes containing enantiopure PG, we demonstrate that the binding of dap to PG, the structural transition that occurs upon dap binding to PG, and the subsequent oligomerization of dap, depends upon the configuration of PG, and that dap prefers the 1,2&#8208;diacyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;1&#8217;&#8208;sn&#8208;glycerol stereoisomer (2R,2'S configuration). Ent&#8208;dap has a lower affinity for 2R,2'S liposomes than dap and cannot oligomerize to the same extent as dap, which accounts for why ent&#8208;dap is less active than dap. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby the activity of an antibiotic depends upon the configuration of a lipid head group.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Iron(III)&#8722;Fluoride&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26281-26286, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIII&#8722;F (formed via ScIII activation) activates C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with reaction rates equivalent to or higher than FeIII&#8722;OH and FeIV=O oxidants. The driving force for fast C&#8722;H activation is ascribed to the higher bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the product formed (BDEF&#8722;H&gt;&#8811;BDEO&#8722;H).







Abstract
We anticipate high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;fluoride species will be highly effective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) oxidants because of the magnitude of the H&#8722;F bond (in the product) that drives HAT oxidation. We prepared a dimeric FeIII(F)&#8722;F&#8722;FeIII(F) complex (1) by reacting [FeII(NCCH3)2(TPA)](ClO4)2 (TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) with difluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane (difluoroiodobenzene). 1 was a sluggish oxidant, however, it was readily activated by reaction with Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids to yield a monomeric [FeIII(TPA)(F)(X)]+ complex (2) where X=F/OTf. 1 and 2 were characterized using NMR, EPR, UV/Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry. 2 was a remarkably reactive FeIII reagent for oxidative C&#8722;H activation, demonstrating reaction rates for hydrocarbon HAT comparable to the most reactive FeIII and FeIV oxidants.

         <title>Combining Electrochemiluminescence Detection with Aptamer&#8208;Gated Indicator Releasing Mesoporous Nanoparticles Enables ppt Sensitivity for Strip&#8208;Based Rapid Tests</title>

The best of both worlds in one strip, i.e., electrochemical excitation and luminescence emission, together with aptamer&#8208;gated hybrid nanomaterials enables the detection of penicillin directly in milk at ultra&#8208;trace levels in less than 5&#8197;min with a simple test strip and a mobile communication device.







Abstract
The combination of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) and aptamer&#8208;gated indicator delivering (gAID) magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles embedded into glass fibre paper functionalised with poly(ethyleneglycol) and N&#8208;(3&#8208;triethoxysilylpropyl)diethanolamine allowed the development of a rapid test that detects penicillin directly in diluted milk down to 50&#177;9 ppt in &lt;5&#8197;min. Covalent attachment of the aptamer &#8220;cap&#8221; to the silica scaffold enabled pore closure through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions with surface amino groups, while binding of penicillin led to a folding&#8208;up of the aptamer thus releasing the ECL reporter Ru(bpy)32+ previously loaded into the material and letting it be detected after lateral flow by a smartphone camera upon electrochemical excitation with a screen printed electrode inserted into a 3D&#8208;printed holder. The approach is simple, generic and presents advantages with respect to sensitivity, measurement uncertainty and robustness compared with conventional fluorescence or electrochemical detection, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;need analyses of challenging matrices and analytes at ultra&#8208;trace levels.

         <title>Ultrastable Cu Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Liquid Fuels by Tuning C&#8211;C Coupling with CuTi Subsurface</title>

The coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy enable electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon liquid fuels including ethanol, acetone and n&#8208;butanol with a total C2&#8208;4 faradaic efficiency of about 49&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).







Abstract
Production of multicarbon (C2+) liquid fuels is a challenging task for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, mainly limited by the stabilization of reaction intermediates and their subsequent C&#8722;C couplings. In this work, we report a unique catalyst, the coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy (a&#8208;CuTi@Cu) toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon (C2&#8208;4) liquid fuels. Remarkably, the electrocatalyst yields ethanol, acetone, and n&#8208;butanol as major products with a total C2&#8208;4 faradaic efficiency of about 49&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which can be maintained for at least 3&#8197;months. Theoretical simulations and in situ characterization reveals that subsurface Ti atoms can increase the electron density of surface Cu sites and enhance the adsorption of *CO intermediate, which in turn reduces the energy barriers required for *CO dimerization and trimerization.

         <title>CO&#8208;Tolerant PEMFC Anodes Enabled by Synergistic Catalysis between Iridium Single&#8208;Atom Sites and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26177-26183, December 6, 2021. </description>

Benefitting from the synergistic effect between single&#8208;atom Ir sites and Ir nanoparticles, a novel CO&#8208;tolerating PEMFC anode catalyst (PEMFC=proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell) exhibits excellent hydrogen oxidation reaction and CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity. On this foundation, the catalyst can maintain a stable operation state in a H2/1000&#8197;ppm CO mixture.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are limited by their extreme sensitivity to trace&#8208;level CO impurities, thus setting a strict requirement for H2 purity and excluding the possibility to directly use cheap crude hydrogen as fuel. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in which a novel catalyst comprising both Ir particles and Ir single&#8208;atom sites (IrNP@IrSA&#8208;N&#8208;C) addresses the CO poisoning issue. The Ir single&#8208;atom sites are found not only to be good CO oxidizing sites, but also excel in scavenging the CO molecules adsorbed on Ir particles in close proximity, thereby enabling the Ir particles to reserve partial active sites towards H2 oxidation. The interplay between Ir nanoparticles and Ir single&#8208;atom centers confers the catalyst with both excellent H2 oxidation activity (1.19&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and excellent CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity (85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in PEMFCs; the catalyst also tolerates CO in H2/CO mixture gas at a level that is two times better than that of the current best PtRu/C catalyst.

         <title>Smart Nanozyme Platform with Activity&#8208;Correlated Ratiometric Molecular Imaging for Predicting Therapeutic Effects</title>

A manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) is developed for real&#8208;time reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;activated cancer therapy by ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. The nanoplatform can self&#8208;monitor the activation of nanozymes during cancer therapy, which has potential to predict therapeutic effects in vivo and guide nanoenzymes in personalized cancer treatment.







Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like characteristics have attracted enormous research interest in biological application. However, there is a lack of facile approach for evaluating the catalytic activity of nanozymes in living system. Herein, we develop a novel manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) with oxidase&#8208;like activity for reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;induced cancer therapy via ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. Notably, MSPN possess oxidase&#8208;like activity in tumor microenvironment, owing to the mixed&#8208;valent MnOx nanoparticles, which can effectively kill cancer cells. Because the semiconducting polymer (PFODBT) is conjugated with oxidase&#8208;responsive molecule (ORM), the catalytic activity of nanozyme can be correlated with the ratiometric signals of NIRF (FL695/FL825) and PA (PA680/PA780), which may provide new ideas for predicting anticancer efficacy of nanozymes in living system.

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Assisted Artesunate Delivery by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Synergistic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26254-26259, December 6, 2021. </description>

Self&#8208;assembled nanomedicine based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with hidden missing linkers shows enhanced artesunate and photosensitizer co&#8208;loading capacity. In the presence of abundant physiological HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ from MOFs activates artesunate&#8208;based oxidative death of cancer cells. Released linkers undergo a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione, contributing to synergistic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Clinical translation of artesunate (ATS) as a potent antitumor drug has been obstructed by its rapid degradation and low bioavailability. Herein, we report the development of an ATS nanomedicine through the self&#8208;assembly with Mn[Co(CN)6]2/3&#9633;1/3 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that have hidden missing linkers. The defects in MOFs originating from the missing linkers play a key role in increasing the biological stability and tumor accumulation of ATS. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ATS can be co&#8208;loaded into MOFs for a synergistic antitumor efficacy. In the presence of intracellular HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ acts as an efficient catalyst to promote the bicarbonate&#8208;activated H2O2 system which oxidizes ATS to generate reactive oxygen species and induce oxidative death to cancer cells. The released [CoIII(CN)6] linker undergoes a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione to prevent the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species, contributing to synergistic chemodynamic therapy of ATS and photodynamic therapy of Ce6. Thus, defect&#8208;engineered MOFs with hidden missing linkers hold great promise in advancing the practical use of ATS as an antitumor medicine.

A sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF &gt;1010. SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was then developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs recorded in a barcode demonstrated practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.







Abstract
Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on chemical mechanism (CM) attracts tremendous attention for great selectivity and stability. However, low enhancement factor (EF) limits its practical applications for trace detection. Here, a novel sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was first created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF of 1.46&#215;1010. This remarkable EF was mainly attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;separation efficacy of p&#8208;n heterojunction and charge transfer resonance resulted from Cu doping. Moreover, the porous structure enriched the probe molecules, resulting in further SERS signals magnification. By immobilizing CuPc as an inner&#8208;reference element, SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs was recorded in a barcode, demonstrating practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.

         <title>Enhanced Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Recombination and Oligonucleotide Assembly in Peptide&#8208;RNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26096-26104, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, a prebiotically plausible ribozyme formed from short oligonucleotides reversibly cleaves an RNA substrate. However, in the presence of poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, phase separation occurs owing to charge interactions between the oppositely charged RNA and peptide. The resulting compartments greatly enhance ribozyme activity, driving the reaction equilibrium towards the ligation of long and complex RNA in mild conditions.







Abstract
The ability of RNA to catalyze RNA ligation is critical to its central role in many prebiotic model scenarios, in particular the copying of information during self&#8208;replication. Prebiotically plausible ribozymes formed from short oligonucleotides can catalyze reversible RNA cleavage and ligation reactions, but harsh conditions or unusual scenarios are often required to promote folding and drive the reaction equilibrium towards ligation. Here, we demonstrate that ribozyme activity is greatly enhanced by charge&#8208;mediated phase separation with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, which shifts the reaction equilibrium from cleavage in solution to ligation in peptide&#8208;RNA coaggregates and coacervates. This compartmentalization enables robust isothermal RNA assembly over a broad range of conditions, which can be leveraged to assemble long and complex RNAs from short fragments under mild conditions in the absence of exogenous activation chemistry, bridging the gap between pools of short oligomers and functional RNAs.

&lt;p&gt;In solution, a prebiotically plausible ribozyme formed from short oligonucleotides reversibly cleaves an RNA substrate. However, in the presence of poly-L-lysine, phase separation occurs owing to charge interactions between the oppositely charged RNA and peptide. The resulting compartments greatly enhance ribozyme activity, driving the reaction equilibrium towards the ligation of long and complex RNA in mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A DNA Molecular Robot that Autonomously Walks on the Cell Membrane to Drive Cell Motility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26087-26095, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA molecular robot that autonomously walks on the cell membrane to drive the cell motility has been developed. The DNA robot could move stepwise on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signal pathway regulation of desired cellular behavior.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular robots can execute sophisticated molecular tasks at nanometer resolution. However, a molecular robot capable of controlling cellular behavior remains unexplored. Herein, we report a self&#8208;propelled DNA robot operating on the cell membrane to control the migration of a cell. Driven by DNAzyme catalytic activity, the DNA robot could autonomously and stepwise move on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signaling for cell motility. The cell membrane&#8208;associated continuous motion and operation of a DNA robot allowed for the ultrasensitive regulation of MET/AKT signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling to enhance cell migration. Finally, we designed distinct conditional DNA robots to orthogonally manipulate the cell migration in a coculture of mixed cell populations. We have developed a novel strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;driving molecular robot, representing a promising avenue for precise cell manipulation with nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Inhibition of Autophagy by a Small Molecule through Covalent Modification of the LC3 Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26105-26114, December 6, 2021. </description>

A potent probe, DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5, was discovered which demonstrates high selectivity to LC3A/B in the proteome. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 inhibits autophagy by attenuating LC3B lipidation, which subsequently reduces the extent of autophagic structure formation and later substrate degradation.







Abstract
The autophagic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein LC3 functions through interactions with LC3&#8208;interaction regions (LIRs) of other autophagy proteins, including autophagy receptors, which stands out as a promising protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) target for the intervention of autophagy. Post&#8208;translational modifications like acetylation of Lys49 on the LIR&#8208;interacting surface could disrupt the interaction, offering an opportunity to design covalent small molecules interfering with the interface. Through screening covalent compounds, we discovered a small molecule modulator of LC3A/B that covalently modifies LC3A/B protein at Lys49. Activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) based evaluations reveal that a derivative molecule DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 exhibits a potent covalent reactivity and selectivity to LC3A/B in HeLa cells. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 compromises LC3B lipidation in&#8197;vitro and in HeLa cells, leading to deficiency in the formation of autophagic structures and autophagic substrate degradation. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 could serve as a powerful tool for autophagy research as well as for therapeutic interventions.

A 3D K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene with a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formed on its surface was employed as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors with high power density and superior cycling stability. This work offers a new insight into design of MXene&#8208;based anode material and the relationship between solvation structure and SEI formation.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance anode materials for potassium&#8208;based energy storage devices with long&#8208;term cyclability requires combined innovations from rational material design to electrolyte optimization. A three&#8208;dimensional K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene with enlarged interlayer distance was constructed for efficient electrochemical potassium&#8208;ion storage. We found that the optimized solvation structure of the concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolyte leads to the formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx electrode, which is beneficial for interfacial stability and reaction kinetics. As a proof of concept, 3D K+&#8208;Ti3C2Tx//activated carbon (AC) potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) were assembled, which exhibited promising electrochemical performances. These results highlight the significant roles of both rational structure design and electrolyte optimization for highly reactive MXene&#8208;based anode materials in energy storage devices.

         <title>Sequential Selective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P Bond Functionalizations: An Entry to Bioactive Arylated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26199-26209, December 6, 2021. </description>

A broadly unified, straightforward method of direct sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;P bond functionalization has been developed to access a variety of synthetically and highly useful bioactive benzhydrylamine, benzhydrylthioether, and triarylmethane motifs from commercially available arenes and simple aldehydes.







Abstract
Organophosphonium salts containing C(sp3)&#8722;+P bonds are among the most utilized reagents in organic synthesis for constructing C&#8722;C double bonds. However, their use as C&#8208;selective electrophilic groups is rare. Here, we explore an efficient and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for sequential chemo&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P bond functionalizations. In the present study, C&#8722;H alkylation resulting in the synthesis of benzhydryl triarylphosphonium salts was achieved by one&#8208;pot, four&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling reactions of simple and commercially available starting materials. The utility of the resulting phosphonium salt building blocks was demonstrated by the chemoselective post&#8208;functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;+PPh3 groups to achieve aminations, thiolations, and arylations. In this way, benzhydrylamines, benzhydrylthioethers, and triarylmethanes, structural motifs that are present in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, are readily accessed. These include the synthesis of two anticancer agents from simple materials in only two to three steps. Additionally, a protocol for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive drugs has been developed using benzhydrylphosphonium salts. This new approach should provide novel transformations for application in both academic and pharmaceutical research.

         <title>Terpolymerization of Ethylene and Two Different Methoxyaryl&#8208;Substituted Propylenes by Scandium Catalyst Makes Tough and Fast Self&#8208;Healing Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26192-26198, December 6, 2021. </description>

The sequence&#8208;controlled terpolymers of ethylene and two different methoxyaryl&#8208;functionalized propylenes synthesized with a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst exhibited excellent elasticity and remarkable self&#8208;healing because of the unique synergistic effects of the multiple components.







Abstract
The terpolymerization of a non&#8208;polar olefin (such as ethylene) and two different polar functional olefins in a controlled fashion is of great interest and importance but has hardly been explored to date. We report for the first time the terpolymerization of ethylene (E) and two different methoxyaryl&#8208;substituted propylenes (AR1P=hexylanisyl propylene; AR2P=methoxynaphthyl propylene or methoxypyrenyl propylene) by a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst. The terpolymerization took place in a sequence&#8208;controlled fashion, affording unique multi&#8208;block copolymers composed of two different ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methoxyarylpropylene sequences E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR1P (soft segments) and E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR2P (hard segments) and relatively short ethylene&#8211;ethylene (EE) blocks (crystalline segments). The terpolymers exhibited excellent elasticity and unprecedented self&#8208;healing as a result of microphase separation of nanodomains of the crystalline EE segments and the hard amorphous E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR2P segments from a very flexible E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR1P matrix, demonstrating unique synergy of the three different components.

A bendable single crystal of an organic semiconductor is reported that can be used as phototransistor, photoswitch and a waveguide. The material exists as two polymorphs with distinct elastic or plastic mechanical properties and can be switched by heating. The crystals are optically conductive in the near&#8208;infrared and can be used as optical waveguides in the telecommunications range.







Abstract
We report the first organic semiconductor crystal with a unique combination of properties that can be used as a multifunctional optoelectronic device. Mechanically flexible single crystals of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) can function as a phototransistor, photoswitch, and an optical waveguide. The material can exist as two structurally different solid phases, with single crystals of one of the phases being elastic at room temperature while those of the other are brittle and become plastic at higher temperature. The output and transfer characteristics of the devices were characterized by measuring the generation and temporal response of the switching of the photogenerated current. The current&#8211;voltage characteristics of both phases exhibit linearity and symmetry about the positive and negative voltages. The crystals transmit light in the telecommunications range with significantly low optical loss for an organic crystalline material.

         <title>NBN&#8208;Doped Bis&#8208;Tetracene and Peri&#8208;Tetracene: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26115-26121, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel double NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes, bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT), are achieved through a combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis. The chemical structures are clearly characterized by STM and AFM. Moreover, NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT can be further tailored to dications, which demonstrate similar electronic properties to their all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based isoelectronic structures bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene.







Abstract
Combining solution&#8208;based and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis, we demonstrate the first synthesis of NBN&#8208;doped bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT). The chemical structures are clearly elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) characterizations reveal that NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT possess higher energy gaps than bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene. Interestingly, NBN&#8208;BT can undergo stepwise one&#8208;electron oxidation and convert into its corresponding radical cation and then to its dication. The energy gap of the NBN&#8208;BT dication is similar to that of bis&#8208;tetracene, indicating their isoelectronic relationship. Moreover, a similar energy gap between the NBN&#8208;PT dication and peri&#8208;tetracene can be predicted by DFT calculations. This work provides a novel synthesis along with characterizations of multi&#8208;NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged peri&#8208;acenes with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Assembled Film from Semiconductor Nanorods with Ultra&#8208;Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26276-26280, December 6, 2021. </description>

Achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods were assembled into chiral films using the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. The CdSe/CdS nanorods films displayed intense circular dichroism response and circularly polarized luminescence signals, which can be adjusted by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers.







Abstract
Chiroptical nanomaterials have generated significant levels of interest for generating strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. We used the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique to generate the continuous and compact assembly of CdSe/CdS chiral film. We assembled achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers. This allowed us to tailor chiroptical properties to achieve high CPL signals. The chiral film was symmetrical and had the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and CPL signals with ten layers (RH (right&#8208;handed)&#8208;/LH (left&#8208;handed)&#8208;5 + 5 layers) and a 45&#176; inter&#8208;angle. Specifically, RH&#8208;5+5 of the chiral film exhibited 1431 mdeg of CD activity and strong CPL signals with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.0997. The helical stacked crystal plates with linear birefringence resulted in strong circular birefringence, as determined by the Reusch model. Electromagnetic simulations indicated that such remarkable optical activity was attributed to the birefringence and dichroism of the well&#8208;aligned CdSe/CdS nanorod layers in the chiral films. Under right/left circular polarized (RCP/LCP) light excitation, the well aligned semiconductor nanorods exhibited differences in the coupling efficiencies to RCP and LCP light. Our CdSe/CdS chiral films, which exhibit ultra&#8208;strong CPL activity, will provide a novel strategy for the fabrication of chiroptical devices.

         <title>Site&#8208;Fixed Hydroboration of Terminal and Internal Alkenes using BX3/iPr2NEt**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel and general method for the hydroboration of alkenes, including aryl alkenes, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, aliphatic alkenes, and bio&#8208;derived alkenes, using BX3 as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The reaction was also applied to the synthesis of linear and branched 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes. The reaction is thought to proceed by a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general hydroboration of alkenes with BX3 (X=Br, Cl) as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The addition of iPr2NEt not only suppresses alkene polymerization and haloboration side reactions but also provides an &#8220;H&#8221; source for hydroboration. More importantly, the site&#8208;fixed installation of a boryl group at the original position of the internal double bond is readily achieved in contrast to conventional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration processes. Further application to the synthesis of 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes (n=3&#8211;10) is also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a major reaction pathway that involves radical species and operates through a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8211;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26080-26086, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic capability of squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases to convert (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;substrates enantiospecifically to (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;configurated monocyclic terpenoids was put into action by a combination of enzyme evolution and substrate engineering for the synthesis of (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone with &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids, an SHC&#8208;wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC (AciSHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (E/Z)&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased to 79&#8201;%. Notably, analyzed AciSHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the (Z)&#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99&#8201;% ee), the (E)&#8208;isomer was converted to the (S,S)&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95&#8201;% ee). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9&#8201;% ee) could be obtained.

Tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated NCA polymerizations to prepare polypeptides, which can proceed ultrafast in open vessels, aqueous environments and using crude NCAs.







Abstract
We design the tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated superfast polymerization on &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCA) for efficient synthesis of polypeptides. Carboxylates, as a new class of initiator for NCA polymerization, can initiate the superfast NCA polymerization without the need of extra catalysts and the polymerization can be operated in open vessels at ambient condition without the use of glove box. Tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated polymerization on NCA easily affords block copolymers with at least 15 blocks. Moreover, this method avoids tedious purification steps and enables direct polymerization on crude NCAs in aqueous environments to prepare polypeptides and one&#8208;pot synthesis of polypeptide nanoparticles. These advantages and the mild polymerization condition of tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated NCA polymerization imply its great potential in functional exploration and application of polypeptides.

An in situ template method is proposed to directionally induce the construction of corals of GeP nanobars featuring high aspect ratio, plentiful exposed facets for rapid Li+ transport, and a self&#8208;healable homeostatic ability to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability.







Abstract
We propose an in situ template method to directionally induce the construction of germanium phosphide nanobar (GeP&#8208;nb) corals with an adjustable aspect ratio. The GeP nanobars grown onto conductive matrix with high aspect ratio expose more quickest electron&#8208;ion transportation facets for fast reaction dynamics. The customized GeP&#8208;nb electrode delivers a self&#8208;healable homeostatic behavior by reversibly stabilizing GeP crystalline structure through multi&#8208;phase reactions to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability (850&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles). As a result, the GeP&#8208;nb presents the highest Li+ diffusion coefficient (6.21&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) among all the Ge&#8208;based anode materials studied so far, rendering an excellent rate performance (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) as a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anode.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into Iron(II) Bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;Bipyridine Skeleton for Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26072-26079, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polypyridine Fe&#8208;based skeleton is reported for selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction even under 1&#8201;% CO2. Mechanistic insights reveal two sequential one&#8208;electron transfer affording an intermediate with delocalized electron density on both Fe and ligand for CO2 addition. Proton&#8208;assisted CO formation is crucial for CO2 reduction.

Abstract
A bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;iron(II) framework (Fe(BPAbipy)) of complexes 1&#8211;3 is reported to shed light on the multistep nature of CO2 reduction. Herein, photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO even at low CO2 concentration (1&#8201;%), together with detailed mechanistic study and DFT calculations, reveal that 1 first undergoes two sequential one&#8208;electron transfer affording an intermediate with electron density on both Fe and ligand for CO2 binding over proton. The following 2&#8201;H+&#8208;assisted Fe&#8208;CO formation is rate&#8208;determining for selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction. A pendant, proton&#8208;shuttling &#945;&#8208;OH group (2) initiates PCET for predominant H2 evolution, while an &#945;&#8208;OMe group (3) cancels the selectivity control for either CO or H2. The near&#8208;unity selectivity of 1 and 2 enables self&#8208;sorting syngas production at flexible CO/H2 ratios. The unprecedented results from one kind of molecular catalyst skeleton encourage insight into the beauty of advanced multi&#8208;electron and multi&#8208;proton transfer processes for robust CO2RR by photocatalysis.

         <title>Predesign of Catalytically Active Sites via Stable Coordination Cluster Model System for Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26210-26217, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular model catalyst system (Cu3&#8208;X) with predesigned catalytically active sites has been constructed to achieve the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4. The active Cu sites display an appropriate spatial distance, resulting in high faradaic efficiencies.







Abstract
Purposefully designing the well&#8208;defined catalysts for the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 is an extremely important but challenging work. In this work, three crystalline trinuclear copper clusters (Cu3&#8208;X, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) have been designed, containing three active Cu sites with the identical coordination environment and appropriate spatial distance, delivering high selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4. The highest faradaic efficiency of Cu3&#8208;X for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion can be adjusted from 31.90&#8201;% to 55.01&#8201;% by simply replacing the counter anions (NO3&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). The DFT calculation results verify that Cu3&#8208;X can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling of identical *CHO intermediates, subsequently forming molecular symmetrical C2H4 product. This work provides an important molecular model system and a new design perspective for electroreduction of CO2 to C2 products with symmetrical molecular structure.

         <title>Is Organic Chemistry Really Growing Exponentially?</title>

The number of reaction examples increases exponentially but the number of new reaction types grows only linearly or sub&#8208;linearly. We re&#8208;use the most familiar and popular reaction classes although we also discover more complex transformations. Analysis of reaction&#8208;type dynamics is useful to estimate numbers of meaningful machine&#8208;learning models that can be constructed and for tracing suspicious/erroneous entries in databases.







Abstract
In terms of molecules and specific reaction examples, organic chemistry features an impressive, exponential growth. However, new reaction classes/types that fuel this growth are being discovered at a much slower and only linear (or even sublinear) rate. The proportion of newly discovered reaction types to all reactions being performed keeps decreasing, suggesting that synthetic chemistry becomes more reliant on reusing the well&#8208;known methods. The newly discovered chemistries are more complex than decades ago and allow for the rapid construction of complex scaffolds in fewer numbers of steps. We study these and other trends in the function of time, reaction&#8208;type popularity and complexity based on the algorithm that extracts generalized reaction class templates. These analyses are useful in the context of computer&#8208;assisted synthesis, machine learning (to estimate the numbers of models with sufficient reaction statistics), and identifying erroneous entries in reaction databases.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Enzymatic Labeling Reveals a Critical Role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in Cell&#8208;Cycle Progression and DNA Damage Response</title>

A galactosyltransferase was engineered to covalently modify the O&#8208;GlcNAc glycan with a biotinylated sugar, allowing for the sensitive capture and profiling of cellular O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins. This strategy identifies flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) as a novel glycoprotein. O&#8208;GlcNAc glycosylation on FEN1 abolishes its interaction with PCNA during DNA replication, leading to aberrant cell&#8208;cycle progression and defects in DNA damage response.







Abstract
O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification of proteins that is essential for cell function. Perturbation of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation leads to altered cell&#8208;cycle progression and DNA damage response. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we develop a highly sensitive one&#8208;step enzymatic strategy for capture and profiling O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins in cells. Using this strategy, we discover that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), an essential enzyme in DNA synthesis, is a novel substrate for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation. FEN1 O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle. O&#8208;GlcNAcylation at the serine 352 of FEN1 disrupts its interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) at the replication foci, and leads to altered cell cycle, defects in DNA replication, accumulation of DNA damage, and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage agents. Thus, our study provides a sensitive method for profiling O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins, and reveals an unknown mechanism of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage response.

         <title>Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Ag15 Nanocluster with Atomic Precision: Structural Analysis and Electrocatalytic Performance toward CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26136-26141, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smallest all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected silver superatom, Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ has an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure. It can adsorb CO2 in the air and exhibits high activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, with FE reaching 95&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V. DFT calculations show that the under&#8208;coordinated Ag atom on Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one ligand releasing from the cluster surface is the active species.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ (abbreviated as Ag15) nanocluster and its electrocatalytic properties toward CO2 reduction reaction. Crystal structure analysis reveals that Ag15 possesses a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure with an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 metal core configuration. Interestingly, we found that Ag15 can adsorb CO2 in the air and spontaneously self&#8208;assembled into one&#8208;dimensional linear material during the crystal growth process. Furthermore, Ag15 can convert CO2 into CO with a faradaic efficiency of ca. 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V and a maximal turnover frequency of 6.37&#8197;s&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V along with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclosed that Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one alkynyl ligand stripping off from the intact cluster can expose the uncoordinated Ag atom as the catalytically active site for CO formation.

         <title>Heavily Tungsten&#8208;Doped Sodium Thioantimonate Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Exceptionally Low Activation Energy for Ionic Diffusion</title>

A multi&#8208;mechanistic strategy for tailoring the composition of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed. Both exhibit exceptionally low activation energies and enhanced room&#8208;temperature (RT) ionic conductivities; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm, respectively.







Abstract
A strategy for modifying the structure of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm. At &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C the Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5&#8197;mS/cm. The 30&#8201;% W content goes far beyond the 10&#8211;12&#8201;% reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo&#8208;cubic or orthorhombic structures. Calculations reveal that these properties result from a combination of multiple diffusion mechanisms, including vacancy defects, strongly correlated modes and excessive Na&#8208;ions. An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) using Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 as the primary SSE and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 400&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Organic Framework in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26268-26275, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework is realized by hierarchical assembly in water. The coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligand to the zinc porphyrin subunits of a monolayer supramolecular network has been utilized to selectively produce ordered bilayer supramolecular architectures with controlled thickness.







Abstract
Accurate control of the layer number of orderly stacked 2D polymers has been an unsettled challenge in self&#8208;assembly. Herein we describe the fabrication of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework from a monolayer 2D supramolecular organic framework in water by utilizing the cooperative coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligands to zinc porphyrin subunits of the monolayer network. The monolayer supramolecular framework is prepared from the co&#8208;assembly of an octacationic zinc porphyrin monomer and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in water through CB[8]&#8208;encapsulation&#8208;promoted dimerization of 4&#8208;phenylpyridiunium subunits that the zinc porphyrin monomer bear. The bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework exhibits structural regularity in both solution and the solid state, which is characterized by synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopic techniques. Atomic force microscopic imaging confirms that the bilayer character of the 2D supramolecular organic framework can be realized selectively on the micrometer scale.

The synthesis of a mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anode alumina oxide (MCS/AAO) hybrid membrane by interfacial super&#8208;assembly is reported. The MCS/AAO hybrid membrane with enhanced permselectivity exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior and superior temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;sensitive salinity gradient energy conversion performance.







Abstract
Nanofluidic devices have been widely used for diode&#8208;like ion transport and salinity gradients energy conversion. Emerging reverse electrodialysis (RED) nanofluidic systems based on nanochannel membrane display great superiority in salinity gradient energy harvesting. However, the imbalance between permeability and selectivity limits their practical application. Here, a new mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anodized aluminum (MCS/AAO) nanofluidic device with enhanced permselectivity for temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated energy generation was obtained by interfacial super&#8208;assembly method. A maximum power density of 5.04&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved, and a higher performance can be obtained by regulating temperature and pH. Theoretical calculations are further implemented to reveal the mechanism for ion rectification, ion selectivity and energy conversion. Results show that the MCS/AAO hybrid membrane has great superiority in diode&#8208;like ion transport, temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated salinity gradient energy conversion.

A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis was developed involving coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal difunctionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes. The reaction is site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral, tolerating air, moisture and a broad scope of functional groups, which makes this method attractive for modular synthesis of complex heteroarene&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is reported involving the selective coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal double C&#8208;H functionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes in a site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The key is to use alkynyl bromides as the second electrophile, which allows vicinal difunctionalization of a wide range of heteroarenes including pyrroles, thiophenes and furans at their C4 and C5 positions. One&#8208; or two&#8208;step tetrafunctionalizations of simple pyrrole and thiophene have also been realized. The C2&#8208;substituted NBEs prove most effective in these reactions, and the mechanistic exploration discloses the origin of the high selectivity of this transformation. Synthetic utility of this method has been exemplified in the concise preparations of thiophene&#8208;containing organic materials and a protein kinase inhibitor analogue. Preliminary success has also been achieved in a direct annulation event, using a tethered ketone as the second electrophile.

         <title>Tailoring the Local Environment of Platinum in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts for Robust Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26054-26062, December 6, 2021. </description>

A highly active and robust single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was developed for CO oxidation by tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ through thermal&#8208;shock synthesis (see picture). Ultrafast shockwaves in an inert atmosphere generated Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration, resulting in greatly enhanced low&#8208;temperature activity that was retained under oxidizing conditions.







Abstract
A single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst formed by atom trapping (AT, 800&#8201;&#176;C in air) shows excellent thermal stability but is inactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures owing to over&#8208;stabilization of Pt2+ in a highly symmetric square&#8208;planar Pt1O4 coordination environment. Reductive activation to form Pt nanoparticles (NPs) results in enhanced activity; however, the NPs are easily oxidized, leading to drastic activity loss. Herein we show that tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ by thermal&#8208;shock (TS) synthesis leads to a highly active and thermally stable Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. Ultrafast shockwaves (&gt;1200&#8201;&#176;C) in an inert atmosphere induced surface reconstruction of CeO2 to generate Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration. Owing to this unique coordination, Pt1&#948;+ in a partially reduced state dynamically evolves during CO oxidation, resulting in exceptional low&#8208;temperature performance. CO oxidation reactivity on the Pt1/CeO2_TS catalyst was retained under oxidizing conditions.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Doped SnS2 Nanoflowers for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26233-26237, December 6, 2021. </description>

Sn&#8208;based materials have been extensively explored in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction to formate, but reaching high selectivity and durability at large current densities remains challenging. Here, a catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy was formed in situ through dynamic restructuring of Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers, leading to an excellent CO2 to formate performance over a wide potential window.







Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing energy consumption and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into chemicals/fuels is becoming a promising yet challenging solution. Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as attractive electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate but suffer from insufficient selectivity and activity, especially at large cathodic current densities. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers can undergo in situ dynamic restructuring to generate catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy for highly selective electrochemical CO2RR to formate over a wide potential window. Theoretical thermodynamic analysis of reaction energetics indicates that the optimal electronic structure of the Sn active site can be regulated by both S&#8208;doping and Cu&#8208;alloying to favor formate formation, while the CO and H2 pathways will be suppressed. Our findings provide a rational strategy for electronic modulation of metal active site(s) for the design of active and selective electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry combines semiconductors with biocatalysts for selective chemical synthesis powered by sunlight, but the overall energy conversion efficiency of these hybrid systems has remained limited to date. In their Communication on page&#8197;26303, Erwin Reisner and co&#8208;workers report the control of the local environment of a formate dehydrogenase integrated in a hierarchical porous TiO2 scaffold. Its coupling to a lead halide perovskite&#8211;BiVO4 tandem light absorber enabled a solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.

Radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission radiation (RASER) is the version of lasers and masers operating in the radiofrequency spectral range. In their Communication on page&#8197;26298, Eduard&#8197;Y. Chekmenev and co&#8208;workers employ 61&#8197;MHz proton RASER to demonstrate robust background&#8208;free detection of biomolecular NMR resonances even in the extreme cases of fully protonated solvents and biological fluids. This approach paves the way to a wide range of high&#8208;resolution NMR and in&#8197;vivo MRI applications of background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized molecules.

Sperm whale derived ambergris has historically been valued for its distinctive olfactory properties. Today, synthetic routes toward the contained (S)&#8208;y&#8208;dihydroionone and its optical antipode, emitting a floral orris&#8208;type odor, are of interest to the fragrance industry. In their Research Article on page&#8197;26080, Rebecca Buller et&#8197;al. employ engineered squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases for the monocyclization of geometric geranylacetone isomers into y&#8208;dihydroionone antipodes.

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for the rational engineering of tailored physical properties. Nevertheless, the molecular and porous nature of MOFs leaves the field juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. This Review reflects on how MOFs can resemble conventional semiconductors and how they are more like infinite molecules in solution.







Abstract
In the realm of solids, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for the rational engineering of tailored physical properties. These derive from the modular, molecular make&#8208;up of MOFs, which allows for the selection and modification of the organic and inorganic building units that construct them. The adaptable properties make MOFs interesting materials for photocatalysis, an area of increasing significance. But the molecular and porous nature of MOFs leaves the field, in some areas, juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. While descriptors from both fields are applied in tandem, the gap between theory and experiment has widened in some areas, and arguably needs fixing. Here we review where MOFs have been shown to be similar to conventional semiconductors in photocatalysis, and where they have been shown to be more like infinite molecules in solution. We do this from the perspective of band theory, which in the context of photocatalysis, covers both the molecular and nonmolecular principles of relevance.

Abstract
Atropisomeric molecules have found proven applications and have shown promising potential in chemistry and medicine. The design of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed reactions to construct atropisomerically enriched molecules has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. These reactions include kinetic resolutions, asymmetric desymmetrizations, central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversions, and cycloadditions. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in NHC&#8208;based organic catalysis for access to atropisomers, and briefly states our personal perspectives on the future advancement of this topic. NHC catalysis has provided rich and unique reaction modes that have led to success in the asymmetric synthesis of central&#8208;chiral molecules. It is expected that similar success could also be achieved in developing NHC catalysis to prepare atropisomeric molecules, including those not easily accessible by other methods.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atropisomeric molecules have found proven applications and have shown promising potential in chemistry and medicine. The design of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed reactions to construct atropisomerically enriched molecules has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. These reactions include kinetic resolutions, asymmetric desymmetrizations, central-to-axial chirality conversions, and cycloadditions. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in NHC-based organic catalysis for access to atropisomers, and briefly states our personal perspectives on the future advancement of this topic. NHC catalysis has provided rich and unique reaction modes that have led to success in the asymmetric synthesis of central-chiral molecules. It is expected that similar success could also be achieved in developing NHC catalysis to prepare atropisomeric molecules, including those not easily accessible by other methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Background&#8208;Free Proton NMR Spectroscopy with Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26298-26302, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) was employed for background&#8208;free detection of hyperpolarized NMR resonances even in the extreme case of protonated solvents and biological fluids. This approach paves the way to a wide range of high&#8208;resolution NMR&#8208; and in&#8197;vivo MRI applications of proton detection of hyperpolarized molecules.







Abstract
We report on the utility of Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) for background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized biomolecules. We performed hyperpolarization of &#8776;0.3&#8197;M ethyl acetate via pairwise parahydrogen addition to vinyl acetate. A proton NMR signal with signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio exceeding 100&#8201;000 was detected without radio&#8208;frequency excitation at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 1.4&#8197;T using a standard (non&#8208;cryogenic) inductive detector with quality factor of Q=68. No proton background signal was observed from protonated solvent (methanol) or other added co&#8208;solvents such as ethanol, water or bovine serum. Moreover, we demonstrate RASER detection without radio&#8208;frequency excitation of a bolus of hyperpolarized contrast agent in biological fluid. Completely background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized contrast agents in biological media paves the way to new applications in the areas of high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and in&#8197;vivo spectroscopy and imaging.

         <title>An NADPH&#8208;Dependent Ketoreductase Catalyses the Tetracyclic to Pentacyclic Skeletal Rearrangement in Chartreusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26378-26384, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rearrangement from the tetracyclic to the pentacyclic compound in the biosynthesis of the antitumor antibiotic chartreusin is very concise and only requires two redox enzymes. ChaZ mediates a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation to give a lactone intermediate. Subsequently, ChaE catalyses an unusual ketoreduction on an ester carbonyl group to give an acetal moiety, followed by a series of spontaneous reaction to construct the pentacyclic compound.







Abstract
Redox tailoring enzymes play key roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in type&#8197;II polyketides. In chartreusin biosynthesis, the early 13C&#8208;labeling experiments and bioinformatic analysis suggest the unusual aglycone is originated from a tetracyclic anthracyclic polyketide. Here, we demonstrated that the carbon skeleton rearrangement from a linear anthracyclic polyketide to an angular pentacyclic biosynthetic intermediate requires two redox enzymes. The flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase ChaZ catalyses a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation on resomycin C to form a seven&#8208;membered lactone. Subsequently, a ketoreductase ChaE rearranges the carbon skeleton and affords the &#945;&#8208;pyrone containing pentacyclic intermediate in an NADPH&#8208;dependent manner via tandem reactions including the reduction of the lactone carbonyl group, Aldol&#8208;type reaction, followed by a spontaneous &#947;&#8208;lactone ring formation, oxidation and aromatization. Our work reveals an unprecedented function of a ketoreductase that contributes to generate structural complexity of aromatic polyketide.

A radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino migration from the oxygen centre of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon centre to achieve valuable fluoroalkyl/functionality&#8208;containing primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;aminoketones has been developed. This migration is triggered by the fluoroalkyl/functional radical which is derived from the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex of its precursor with quinuclidine.







Abstract
A novel radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino shift from the oxygen center of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon center to achieve high value&#8208;added fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones is reported. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration is triggered by the alkene addition of fluoroalkyl radical derived from the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex of Togni's reagent II or fluoroalkyl iodides and quinuclidine, and involves a unique 5(6)&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the N&#8208;atom of ketoxime ethers followed by a cascade sequence of N&#8722;O bond cleavage and dehydrogenation. Notably, besides Togni's reagent II and fluoroalkyl iodides, this protocol is also compatible with other radical precursors to provide various functionalized primary aminoketones.

Formate dehydrogenase was interfaced with a perovskite to produce a photocathode that benefits from an optimized local enzyme environment via the electrolyte solution and achieves an unprecedented current density. Combination with a BiVO4 water oxidation photoanode gave a bias&#8208;free biophotoelectrochemical tandem leaf with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry can combine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic light&#8208;absorbers with enzymes evolved for selective fuel&#8208;forming reactions such as CO2 reduction, but the overall performance of such hybrid systems has been limited to date. Here, the electrolyte constituents were first tuned to establish an optimal local environment for a W&#8208;formate dehydrogenase to perform electrocatalysis. The CO2 reductase was then interfaced with a triple cation lead mixed&#8208;halide perovskite through a hierarchically structured porous TiO2 scaffold to produce an integrated photocathode achieving a photocurrent density of &#8722;5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode during simulated solar light irradiation. Finally, the combination with a water&#8208;oxidizing BiVO4 photoanode produced a bias&#8208;free integrated biophotoelectrochemical tandem device (semi&#8208;artificial leaf) with a solar CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate energy conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linked Poly&#8208;4&#8208;Acrylomorpholine: A Flexible and Reversibly Compressible Aligning Gel for Anisotropic NMR Analysis of Peptides and Small Molecules in Water</title>

Determination of the solution We synthesized a new anisotropic alignment media, p&#8208;4&#8208;AM, that is compatible with water and reusable. P&#8208;4&#8208;AM was characterized with strychnine hydrochloride as a model compound and used to determine the solution conformation of a cyclic peptide. This alignment media will increase the use of residual dipolar couplings (RDC) in structure&#8208;based drug design by enabling the identification of minor solution conformations in water.







Abstract
Determination of the solution conformation of both small organic molecules and peptides in water remains a substantial hurdle in using NMR solution conformations to guide drug design due to the lack of easy to use alignment media. Herein we report the design of a flexible compressible chemically cross&#8208;linked poly&#8208;4&#8208;acrylomorpholine gel that can be used for the alignment of both small molecules and cyclic peptides in water. To test the new gel, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and J&#8208;coupling constants were used in the configurational analysis of strychnine hydrochloride, a molecule that has been studied extensively in organic solvents as well as a small cyclic peptide that is known to form an &#945;&#8208;helix in water. The conformational ensembles for each molecule with the best fit to the data are reported. Identification of minor conformers in water that cannot easily be determined by conventional NOE measurements will facilitate the use of RDC experiments in structure&#8208;based drug design.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Reactivity Relationship for Nano&#8208;Catalysts in the Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Controlled Reaction Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
The prediction of the activity of a large nano&#8208;catalyst is a challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we developed a theoretical model to build the dependence of activity on generalized coordination number based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In the application on Cu catalytic WGS reaction, the apparent activation energy predicted by our simple model is in close agreement with experiments for particles up to 1000&#8197;nm.







Abstract
For the activity of a nano&#8208;catalyst, a general and quantitative solution to building direct structure&#8211;reactivity relationship has not yet been established. On top of the first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we developed a model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity. We applied this model to study the nano effects of Cu catalysts in the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. By accumulating the activities of different adsorption sites, our model satisfactorily reproduced the experimental apparent activation energies for catalysts with sizes over hundreds of nanometers, which were out of reach for conventional KMC simulations. Our results disclose that, even for a cubic catalyst with size of 877&#8197;nm, its activity can still be closely related to the activity of edge sites, instead of only the exposed Cu(100) facets as might be expected. The present model is expected to be useful for systems that are controlled by the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes.

Electrophilic fluorination of alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida species proceeds through bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type rearrangement.







Abstract
The electrophilic fluorination of geminal alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida derivatives proceeds via bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. According to DFT modelling studies this rearrangement occurs with a low activation barrier via a bora&#8208;cyclopropane shaped TS. The Bmida group has a larger migration aptitude than the alkyl moiety in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement of the presented electrophilic fluorination reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Substitution with Copper(I) Homoenolates Generated from Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26351-26356, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with NHC&#8208;stabilized copper(I) homoenolates generated from cyclopropanols is developed that affords &#947;&#8208;chiral ketones in excellent regio&#8208; and high enantioselectivities. This process enables the generation of chiral quaternary carbon centers and features a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
By using copper(I) homoenolates as nucleophiles, which are generated through the ring&#8208;opening of 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols, a catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with allyl phosphates is achieved in high to excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. Both 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols and allylic phosphates enjoy broad substrate scopes. Remarkably, various functional groups, such as ether, ester, tosylate, imide, alcohol, nitro, and carbamate are well tolerated. Moreover, the present method is nicely extended to the asymmetric construction of quaternary carbon centers. Some control experiments argue against a radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism and a catalytic cycle based on a two&#8208;electron process is proposed. Finally, the synthetic utilities of the product are showcased by means of the transformations of the terminal olefin group and the ketone group.

Monodisperse and tunable polymer nanocapsules are synthesized via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules, dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. This streamlined method not only provides functional nanocapsules, but also enables the facile accommodation of functional cores for yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures, expediting the development of multifunctional nanosystems.







Abstract
Polymer nanocapsules have demonstrated significant value in materials science and biomedical technology, but require complicated and time&#8208;consuming synthetic steps. We report here the facile synthesis of monodisperse polymer nanocapsules via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules: dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol (BDT). Specifically, BDT forms core templates and modulates the oxidation kinetics of dopamine into polydopamine (PDA) shells. These uniform nanoparticles can be tuned between &#8776;70 and 200&#8197;nm because the core diameter directly depends on BDT while the shell thickness depends on dopamine. The supramolecular core can then rapidly disassemble in organic solvents to produce PDA nanocapsules. Such nanocapsules exhibit enhanced physicochemical performance (e.g., loading capacity, photothermal transduction, and anti&#8208;oxidation) versus their solid counterparts. Particularly, this method enables a straightforward encapsulation of functional nanoparticles providing opportunities for designing complex nanostructures such as yolk&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

Mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis over Fe catalysts promoted by alkali metals, especially Rb or Cs, is possible under ball milling. The reaction proceeds at appreciable rates at room&#8208;temperature and down to atmospheric pressure in a continuously operating system under gas flow.







Abstract
Ammonia synthesis via the high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure Haber&#8208;Bosch process is one of the most important chemical processes in the world. In spite of numerous attempts over the last 100&#8197;years, continuous Haber&#8208;Bosch type ammonia synthesis at room&#8208;temperature had not been possible, yet. We report the development of a mechanocatalytic system operating continuously at room&#8208;temperature and at pressures down to 1&#8197;bar. With optimized experimental conditions, a cesium&#8208;promoted iron catalyst was shown to produce ammonia at concentrations of more than 0.2&#8197;vol.&#8201;% for over 50&#8197;hours.

         <title>A General Strategy for Instantaneous and Continuous Synthesis of Ultrasmall Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26390-26396, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrasmall MOF nanoparticles could be instantaneously synthesized in a continuous way by a facile and universal strategy with the aid of high gravity intensification technology. This approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs. The as&#8208;prepared ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for the Knoevenagel reaction.







Abstract
Ultrasmall metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) may generate unique properties to expand the scope of applications. However, the synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize ultrasmall MOFs by high gravity technology. With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high&#8208;gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94&#8201;% or 75&#8201;% compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8. More importantly, this approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs, which may promote the convenient synthesis and practical applications of ultrasmall MOFs in large&#8208;scale.

         <title>Photochemical Organocatalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Conjugate Addition of Allyl Groups to Enals</title>

The first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is disclosed. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then stereoselectively intercepted with high &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, complete chemoselectivity, and moderate to good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then intercepted stereoselectively. The underlying radical mechanism of this process overcomes the poor regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity that traditionally affects the conjugate allylation of enals proceeding via polar pathways. We also demonstrate how this organocatalytic strategy could selectively install a valuable prenyl fragment at the &#946;&#8208;carbon of enals.

A hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was demonstrated on&#8208;surface in single molecules of a cyclic strained triyne. The starting material, several intermediates and the product were visualized by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is one of the most popular reactions in organic chemistry. However, its use in the field of on&#8208;surface synthesis is hampered by the spatial restrictions of this cycloaddition reaction. Herein we selected a cyclic strained triyne to demonstrate an on&#8208;surface hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in a single molecule. The reaction was studied in detail by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips.

         <title>Synergetic Cobalt&#8208;Copper&#8208;Based Bimetal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoboxes toward Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>

Cobalt&#8208;copper&#8208;based conductive bimetal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) have been synthesized as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst, through a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the bimetallic synergetic effect and the well&#8208;designed hollow architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and robust long&#8208;term stability toward efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts and understanding their underlying catalytic mechanism are of significant importance for the high&#8208;performance energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, we report novel CoCu&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) as promising catalysts toward efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), fabricated via a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the highly exposed bimetal centers and the well&#8208;designed architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent OER activity and stability, with a small overpotential of 271&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high turnover frequency value of 0.326&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#8197;mV. In combination of quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed CoCu&#8208;based oxyhydroxide analogue during OER is believed to account for the high OER activity of CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs, where the electronic synergy between Co and neighbouring Cu atoms promotes the O&#8722;O bond coupling toward fast OER kinetics.

Here we developed a ROS/RNS and base dual activatable NIR&#8208;II molecular probe PN910 based on modulating the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect of a merocyanine fluorophore named Chrodol&#8208;3. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PN910 is a reliable NIR&#8208;II sensor for the non&#8208;invasive specific monitoring of H2O2 and ONOO&#8722; in alkaline tissue.







Abstract
Inflammation usually results in high&#8208;level reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) not only in acidic tissue but also in alkaline tissue. However, noninvasively in vivo monitoring reactive species specifically within alkaline tissue remains a huge challenge. Here we introduce a dual activatable fluorescent probe PN910 located in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 900&#8211;1700&#8197;nm), which shows high selectivity toward H2O2 and OONO&#8722; at pH beyond 7.4. Then we verified that PN910 could be used for the real&#8208;time, specific and accurate monitoring of cystitis and colitis for living animals. This report presents a unique approach to the development of dual activatable probe for in vivo biosensing.

         <title>Responsive Interfacial Assemblies Based on Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>

By taking advantage of charge transfer (CT) interactions between water&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;deficient acceptor and oil&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;rich donor, the formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface is presented. With CTCSs as the building block, higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties are produced, which can be used to stabilize and structure liquids.







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) interactions have been widely used to construct supramolecular systems, such as functional nanostructures and gels. However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. Here, by using an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron&#8208;rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox&#8208;responsiveness of the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Difunctionalization of Cyclohexenyl Triflates: Direct Access to Versatile Cyclohexenes via Cyclohexynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26332-26336, December 6, 2021. </description>

We report an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates, via strained cyclic alkyne intermediates generated in situ. The importance and utility of this method is exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.







Abstract
Difunctionalization of strained cyclic alkynes presents a powerful strategy to build richly functionalized cyclic alkenes in an expedient fashion. Herein we disclose an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates. We have demonstrated the novel use of zincate base/nucleophile system for effective formation of key cyclohexyne intermediates and selective addition of various carbon and nitrogen nucleophiles. Importantly, leveraging the resulting organozincates enables the incorporation of a broad range of electrophilic partners to deliver structurally diverse cyclohexene motifs. The importance and utility of this method is also exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Peptide Dendrimer Inspired from Glatiramer Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26403-26408, December 6, 2021. </description>

To identify an alternative to the polymeric peptide drug Glatiramer Acetate (GA) used to treat multiple sclerosis, we tested peptide dendrimers with a size and composition similar to that of GA for their ability to induce the release of the cytokine IL1&#8208;Ra from primary human monocytes. The best dendrimer is as active as GA and is shown by fluorescence labelling to internalize into monocytes and to trigger a distinct anti&#8208;inflammatory response.







Abstract
Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a random polypeptide drug used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease. With the aim of identifying a precisely defined alternative to GA, we synthesized a library of peptide dendrimers with an amino acid composition similar to GA. We then challenged the dendrimers to trigger the release of the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;1 receptor antagonist (IL&#8208;1Ra) from human monocytes, which is one of the effects of GA on immune cells. Several of the largest dendrimers tested were as active as GA. Detailed profiling of the best hit showed that this dendrimer induces the differentiation of monocytes towards an M2 (anti&#8208;inflammatory) state as GA does, however with a distinct immune marker profile. Our peptide dendrimer might serve as starting point to develop a well&#8208;defined immunomodulatory analog of GA.

         <title>Directed Regioselective Carbometallation of 1,2&#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropenes</title>

The copper&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation reaction of cyclopropenes is a well&#8208;established method for the synthesis of stereodefined cyclopropanes. All existing reports to date proceeded towards the formation of the electronically more stable organometallic intermediate. Herein we report a regioselective addition to 1,2&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropene possessing a tethered directing group to direct the organometallic species towards the formation of single regioisomer intermediate out of two electronically unbiased possibilities.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation of 1,2&#8208;dialkylated cyclopropenes is reported. The regioselectivity is controlled by a subtle tethered Lewis basic moiety. The chelating moieties allow the differentiation between two electronically tantamount organometallic intermediates. Further functionalization grants access to polysubstituted stereodefined cyclopropanes bearing up to five alkyl groups.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Fusion Cellular Vesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26320-26326, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) were developed to elicit potent antitumor immunity by concurrently blocking innate immune checkpoint CD47 and adaptive immune checkpoint PD&#8208;L1. The Fus&#8208;CVs represent a simple, safe and robust alternative to fusion proteins for multi&#8208;targeting immune blockade checkpoint (ICB) therapy.







Abstract
Herein, we report that genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) displaying high&#8208;affinity SIRP&#945; variants and PD&#8208;1 can activate potent antitumor immunity through both innate and adaptive immune effectors. Dual&#8208;blockade of CD47 and PD&#8208;L1 with Fus&#8208;CVs significantly increases the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages, promotes antigen presentation, and activates antitumor T&#8208;cell immunity. Moreover, the bispecific targeting design of Fus&#8208;CVs ensures better targeting on tumor cells, but less on other cells, which reduces systemic side effects and enhances therapeutic efficacies. In malignant melanoma and mammary carcinoma models, we demonstrate that Fus&#8208;CVs significantly improve overall survival of model animals by inhibiting post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and metastasis. The Fus&#8208;CVs are suitable for protein display by genetic engineering. These advantages, integrated with other unique properties inherited from source cells, make Fus&#8208;CVs an attractive platform for multi&#8208;targeting immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

     alt="Genetically Programmable Fusion Cellular Vesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus-CVs) were developed to elicit potent antitumor immunity by concurrently blocking innate immune checkpoint CD47 and adaptive immune checkpoint PD-L1. The Fus-CVs represent a simple, safe and robust alternative to fusion proteins for multi-targeting immune blockade checkpoint (ICB) therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report that genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus-CVs) displaying high-affinity SIRP&#945; variants and PD-1 can activate potent antitumor immunity through both innate and adaptive immune effectors. Dual-blockade of CD47 and PD-L1 with Fus-CVs significantly increases the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages, promotes antigen presentation, and activates antitumor T-cell immunity. Moreover, the bispecific targeting design of Fus-CVs ensures better targeting on tumor cells, but less on other cells, which reduces systemic side effects and enhances therapeutic efficacies. In malignant melanoma and mammary carcinoma models, we demonstrate that Fus-CVs significantly improve overall survival of model animals by inhibiting post-surgery tumor recurrence and metastasis. The Fus-CVs are suitable for protein display by genetic engineering. These advantages, integrated with other unique properties inherited from source cells, make Fus-CVs an attractive platform for multi-targeting immune checkpoint blockade therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A catalytic Tafel plot showed that&#160;{SiCu3W9}&#160;was the most reactive for CO2&#160;reduction, and electrolysis reactions yielded significant amounts of CO with 98% faradaic efficiency. In contrast, Fe&#8208;Ni compounds such as {SiFeNi2W9}&#160;preferably catalyzed the oxidation of CO to CO2&#160;similar to what is observed for the [NiFe]&#8208;CODH enzyme. Compositional control of the heterometal complexes, now and in the future leads to control of reactivity and selectivity for CO2&#160;electrocatalytic reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation Pathways in Colloidal CdTeSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rarely studied transformation in colloidal ternary magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) is addressed. We report the first observation of the transformation from ternary CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 to MSC&#8208;422, which occurs at room temperature. These two MSC types display sharp optical absorption resonances at 399 and 422 nm respectively, and are related in that they are quasi isomers, together with their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs). Binary CdTe and CdSe samples were prepared in the prenucleation stage also called the induction period (IP). After they were mixed and placed in a mixture of toluene and octylamine, the transformation was found to take place and to be assisted by the addition of the CdSe IP sample. A binary IP sample contains corresponding binary PCs and monomers (Mo) and fragments (Fr). We argue that the transformation pathway is enabled by the corresponding ternary PCs, involving the substitution reaction, namely CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;1 &#8658; CdTeSe PC&#8208;422 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;2. The present study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation characteristics of the MSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;Anchored Rhenium(I) Photosensitizer Evokes Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An ideal cancer treatment should not only destroy primary tumors, but also improve the immunogenicity of tumor microenvironment to achieve satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor immune effect.&#160; Herein, we designed a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored rhenium(I) photosensitizer, named as  CA&#8208;Re, not only performing type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II photodynamic therapy (PDT) with high efficiency under hypoxia (nanomolar&#8208;level phototoxicity), but also evoking gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptotic cell death to effectively stimulate tumor immunogenicity. Meanwhile,  CA&#8208;Re&#160;could disrupt and self&#8208;report the loss of membrane integrity simultaneously. As a result, this promoted the maturation and antigen&#8208;presenting ability of dendritic cells (DCs), and fully activated T cells dependent adaptive immune response in vivo, eventually eliminating distant tumors at the same time as destroying primary tumors. To the best of our knowledge,  CA&#8208;Re  is the first metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer, and this work provides a tantalizing angle for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Persistent Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Thioketyl Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal salts, M  +  [Ter(  i  Pr)P&#8208;C(=S)&#8208;P(  i  Pr)  2  S]  &#8226;&#8722;  (M = Na, K;  2_M;  Ter = 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;phenyl) containing a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable thioketyl radical anion were obtained by reduction of the thioketone precursor, Ter(  i  Pr)P&#8208;C(=S)&#8208;P(  i  Pr)  2  S (  1  ), with alkali metals (Na, K). Single crystal X&#8208;ray studies as well as EPR spectroscopy revealed the unequivocal existence of a thioketyl radical anion in the solid state and in solution, respectively. The computed Mulliken spin density within  2_M  is mainly located at the sulfur (49%) and the carbonyl carbon (33%) atoms.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alkali metal salts, M  +  [Ter(  i  Pr)P-C(=S)-P(  i  Pr)  2  S]  &#8226;&#8722;  (M = Na, K;  2_M;  Ter = 2,6-bis-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)-phenyl) containing a room-temperature-stable thioketyl radical anion were obtained by reduction of the thioketone precursor, Ter(  i  Pr)P-C(=S)-P(  i  Pr)  2  S (  1  ), with alkali metals (Na, K). Single crystal X-ray studies as well as EPR spectroscopy revealed the unequivocal existence of a thioketyl radical anion in the solid state and in solution, respectively. The computed Mulliken spin density within  2_M  is mainly located at the sulfur (49%) and the carbonyl carbon (33%) atoms. Upon adding [2.2.2]-cryptand to the radical species  2_K  to minimize the interionic interaction, an activation reaction was observed, yielding a potassium salt with a phosphanyl thioether based anion, [K(crypt)]  +  [Ter(  i  Pr)P-C(&#8211;S-  i  Pr)-P(  i  Pr)  2  S]  &#8722;  (  3  ) as the product of an intermolecular shift of an  i  Pr group from a second anion.

         <title>Titanocene(III) Catalyzed Precision Deuteration of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a titanocene(III) catalyzed deuterosilylation of epoxides that provides &#946;&#8211;deuterated anti&#8208;Markovnikov alcohols with excellent D&#8208;incorporation, in high yield, and often excellent diastereoselectivity after desilylation. The key to the success of the reaction is a novel activation method of Cp2TiCl2 and (tBuC5H4)2TiCl2 with BnMgBr and PhSiD3 to provide [(RC5H4)2Ti(III)D] without isotope scrambling. It was developed after discovering an off&#8208;cycle scrambling with the previously described method. Our precision deuteration can be applied to the synthesis of drug precursors and highlights the power of combining radical chemistry with organometallic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Refining of Particulates at Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Interfaces: Label&#8208;Free Sorting and Isolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of separation methods, e.g. liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption&#8208;desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions  kT  , required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few  kT  for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi&#8208;irreversible. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle&#8208;polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial&#8208;scale label&#8208;free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Structure, Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a new family of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; mesoporous silica nanoparticles has attracted great interest with widespread applications. Despite a large number of publications (&gt;800), the terminology of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; is ambiguous. Understanding what possible &#8220;dendritic structures&#8221; are, their formation mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8208;property relationship is fundamentally important. With the advance of characterization techniques such as electron tomography, two types of tree branch&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like structures can be distinguished, both described as &#8220;dendritic&#8221; in literature. In this review, we start with the definition of &#8220;dendritic&#8221;, then provide critical analysis of reported dendritic silica nanoparticles according to their structural classification. We also update the understandings of the formation mechanisms of two types of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; nanoparticles, with a focus on how to control different structural parameters. Various applications of dendritic mesoporous nanoparticles are also reviewed with a focus in biomedical field, providing new insights into the structure&#8208;property relationship in this family of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Exchange of Substituents in a Prebiotic Organocatalyst: Initial Steps towards an Evolutionary System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotically plausible imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione organocatalysts are able to dynamically adapt to their environment by mutation of their own structure. Depending on the surrounding conditions, a distinct preference for certain species was identified, that correlates with the catalytic activity. This variation and selection mechanism allows for ongoing evolution of catalytic properties to create the complex diversity of life.







Abstract
All evolutionary biological processes lead to a change in heritable traits over successive generations. The responsible genetic information encoded in DNA is altered, selected, and inherited by mutation of the base sequence. While this is well known at the biological level, an evolutionary change at the molecular level of small organic molecules is unknown but represents an important prerequisite for the emergence of life. Here, we present a class of prebiotic imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione organocatalysts able to dynamically change their constitution and potentially capable to form an evolutionary system. These catalysts functionalize their building blocks and dynamically adapt to their (self&#8208;modified) environment by mutation of their own structure. Depending on the surrounding conditions, they show pronounced and opposing selectivity in their formation. Remarkably, the preferentially formed species can be associated with different catalytic properties, which enable multiple pathways for the transition from abiotic matter to functional biomolecules.

         <title>Selective C(sp3)&#8722;N Bond Cleavage of N,N&#8208;Dialkyl Tertiary Amines with the Loss of a Large Alkyl Group via an SN1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd0&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1] annulation of alkyne&#8208;tethered aryl iodides with tertiary hydroxylamines has been developed for the rapid assembly of 3,4&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles with a removable aliphatic N&#8208;substituent. This domino reaction was realized by alkyne&#8208;directed palladacycle formation, electrophilic amination with tertiary hydroxylamines and selective C(sp3)&#8722;N bond cleavage with the loss of the larger alkyl group via an SN1 path.







Abstract
Polar disconnection of the C(sp3)&#8722;N bond of N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tertiary amines via ammonium species conventionally favored the loss of the smaller alkyl group by an SN2 displacement, while selective C(sp3)&#8722;N bond cleavage by cutting off the larger alkyl group is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present a novel Pd0&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1] annulation, proceeding through an alkyne&#8208;directed palladacycle formation and consecutive diamination with a tertiary hydroxylamine by cleaving its N&#8722;O bond and one C(sp3)&#8722;N bond, for the rapid assembly of tricyclic indoles in a single&#8208;step transformation. Noteworthy, experimental results indicated that large tert&#8208;butyl and benzyl groups were selectively cleaved via an SN1 pathway, in the presence of a smaller alkyl group (Me, Et, iPr). Under the guidance of this new finding, tricyclic indoles bearing a removable alkyl group could be exclusively obtained by using a (&#945;&#8208;methyl)benzyl/benzyl or tert&#8208;butyl/2&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl mixed amino source.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Indole Diterpenes Paspalicine, Paspalinine, and Paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric total synthesis of three paspaline&#8208;derived indole diterpenes paspalicine, paspalinine and paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene is reported. This synthesis features a green Achmatowicz rearrangement/bicycloketalization for the efficient construction of FG rings, a cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis of dienyne for highly regioselective formation of CD rings, and four palladium&#8208;mediated reactions to forge BE rings.







Abstract
Paspaline&#8208;derived indole diterpenes (IDTs) are structurally complex mycotoxins with unique tremorgenic activity. Reported are asymmetric total syntheses of three paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs paspalicine, paspalinine and paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene. Our synthesis features a green Achmatowicz rearrangement/bicycloketalization for the efficient construction of FG rings (75&#8201;% yield) and a cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis of dienyne for highly regioselective formation of CD rings (72&#8201;% yield). Other highlights include four palladium&#8208;mediated reactions (Stille, aza&#8208;Wacker, Suzuki, and Heck) to forge the BE rings and the installation of two continuous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via reductive ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane and &#945;&#8208;methylation of the conjugate ester. Our new synthetic strategy is expected to be applicable to the chemical synthesis of other paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs and will facilitate the bioactivity studies of these agriculturally and pharmacologically important IDTs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on an Organic Antimony(III) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent organic antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh3)2SbCl5 featured with STE emission is prepared with good reproducibility and high stability. High&#8208;efficiency OLEDs is demonstrated by this hybrid as an emitter with the luminance of 3500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, current efficiency of 6.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and EQE of 3.1&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
As low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free hybrids with higher stability and lower toxicity than those of three&#8208;dimensional lead perovskites, organic antimony(III) halides show great application potential in opt&#8208;electronic field owing to diverse topologies along with exceptional optical properties. We report herein an antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh3)2SbCl5 with a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structure, which exhibits brilliant orange emission peaked at 593&#8197;nm with near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yield (99.4&#8201;%). The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that the broadband emission with a microsecond lifetime (3.24&#8197;&#956;s) arises from self&#8208;trapped emission (STE). Electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on neat and doped films of (MePPh3)2SbCl5 were fabricated. The doped devices show significant improvement in comparison to non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Owing to the much improved surface morphology and balanced carrier transport in light&#8208;emitting layers of doped devices, the peak luminance, current efficiency (CE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are boosted from 82&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 3500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, 1.1&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 to 6.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 0.7&#8201;% to 3.1&#8201;% relative to non&#8208;doped devices, respectively.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Late&#8208;Stage C&#8722;H Oxidations of ent&#8208;Trachylobane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an asymmetric synthesis of several ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids. The developed strategy is based on the two&#8208;phase terpenoid synthesis concept and involves carbon framework assembly (Cyclase Phase) and aliphatic C&#8722;H oxidation (Oxidase Phase). This enabled access to seven natural products and diverse non&#8208;natural analogs that were previously inaccessible via enzymatic and/or chemical methods. The robustness of the chemistry was demonstrated by preparing 300&#8197;mg of methyl ent&#8208;trachyloban&#8208;19&#8208;oate.







Abstract
Herein, we present our studies to construct seven ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids by employing a bioinspired two&#8208;phase synthetic strategy. The first phase provided enantioselective and scalable access to five ent&#8208;trachylobanes, of which methyl ent&#8208;trachyloban&#8208;19&#8208;oate was produced on a 300&#8197;mg scale. During the second phase, chemical C&#8722;H oxidation methods were employed to enable selective conversion to two naturally occurring higher functionalized ent&#8208;trachylobanes. The formation of regioisomeric analogs, which are currently inaccessible via enzymatic methods, reveals the potential as well as limitations of established chemical C&#8722;H oxidation protocols for complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as a New Class of Promising Cathode Materials for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a small conjugate system were proposed as potential aluminium ion battery (AIB) cathode materials through quantum chemistry calculations and experimental verification. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate that PAHs break through the limitation of graphite to form stage&#8208;4 graphite&#8208;intercalated compounds (GICs) at the fully charged state and exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance.







Abstract
As an emerging post&#8208;lithium battery technology, aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) have the advantages of large Al reserves and high safety, and have great potential to be applied to power grid energy storage. But current graphite cathode materials are limited in charge storage capacity due to the formation of stage&#8208;4 graphite&#8208;intercalated compounds (GICs) in the fully charged state. Herein, we propose a new type of cathode materials for AIBs, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which resemble graphite in terms of the large conjugated &#960; bond, but do not form GICs in the charge process. Quantum chemistry calculations show that PAHs can bind AlCl4&#8722; through the interaction between the conjugated &#960; bond in the PAHs and AlCl4&#8722;, forming on&#8208;plane interactions. The theoretical specific capacity of PAHs is negatively correlated with the number of benzene rings in the PAHs. Then, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, anthracene, a three&#8208;ring PAH, was evaluated as a cathode material for AIBs. Electrochemical measurements show that anthracene has a high specific capacity of 157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and still maintains a specific capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a feasible &#8220;theory guides practice&#8221; research model for the development of energy storage materials, and also provides a new class of promising cathode materials for AIBs.

         <title>On&#8208;DNA Transfer Hydrogenolysis and Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction using Pd/C, HCONH4 and the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M for hydrogenolysis of Cbz&#8208;protected amines and benzyl protected alcohols and hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, nitros, nitriles, halides and aldehydes of DNA&#8208;conjugated substrates. The methodology is fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis. This method will enable synthetic DEL sequences using orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) are an increasingly popular approach to finding small molecule ligands for proteins. Many DEL synthesis protocols hinge on sequential additions of monomers using split&#8208;pool combinatorial methods. Therefore, compatible protecting group strategies that allow the unmasking of reactive functionality (e.&#8201;g. amines and alcohols) prior to monomer coupling, or the removal of less desirable functionality (e.&#8201;g., alkenes and alkynes) are highly desirable.

We report a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction using Pd/C, HCONH4 and the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, which gives highly efficient conversions for hydrogenolysis of Cbz&#8208;protected amines and benzyl protected alcohols and hydrogenation of nitros, halides, nitriles, aldehydes, alkenes and alkynes. Application to multicycle synthesis of an encoded compound was fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of metallic conductivity in polyacetylene [&#8208;HC=CH&#8208;]n upon doping represents a landmark achievement. However, the insolubility of polyacetylene and a dearth of methods for its chemical modification have limited its widespread use. Here, we employ a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) protocol to prepare functionalized polyacetylenes (fPAs) bearing: (1) electron&#8208;deficient boryl (&#8208;BR2) and phosphoryl (&#8208;P(O)R2) side chains; (2) electron&#8208;donating amino (&#8208;NR2) groups, and (3) ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium units via strain&#8208;promoted Click chemistry. These functional groups render most of the fPAs soluble and can lead to intense light absorption across the visible to near&#8208;IR region. Also, the presence of redox&#8208;active boryl and amino groups leads to opposing near&#8208;IR optical responses upon (electro)chemical reduction or oxidation. Some of the resulting fPAs show greatly enhanced air stability when compared to known polyacetylenes. Lastly, these fPAs can be cross&#8208;linked to yield network materials with the full retention of optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Porphyrin&#8208;Complex Multi&#8208;Block Co&#8208;Oligomers by Defluorinative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface chemical reaction has become a very powerful technique to synthesize nanostructures by linking small molecules in the bottom&#8208;up approach. Given the fact that most reactants are simultaneously activated at certain temperatures, a sequential reaction in a controlled way has remained challenging. Here, we present an on&#8208;surface synthesis of multi&#8208;block co&#8208;oligomers from trifluoromethyl (CF  3  ) substituted porphyrin metal complexes. The oligomerization on Au(111) is demonstrated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Even after the first oligomerization of single monomer unit, the termini of the oligomer keep the CF  3  group, which can be used as a reactant for further coupling in a sequential order. Consequently, copper, cobalt, and palladium complexes of bisanthracene&#8208;fused porphyrin oligomers were linked with each other in a designed order.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Bismuth Bicycles: In Situ Access to Stable Constrained Peptides with Superior Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constrained peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics. We report here a fundamentally new strategy for the facile generation of bicyclic peptides using linear precursor peptides with three cysteine residues and non&#8208;toxic trivalent bismuth(III) salt. Peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles form instantaneously at physiological pH, are stable in aqueous solution for many weeks, and much more resistant to proteolysis than their linear precursors. The strategy allows the  in&#8208;situ  generation of bicyclic ligands for biochemical screening assays. We demonstrate this for two screening campaigns targeting the proteases from Zika and West Nile viruses, revealing a new lead compound that displayed inhibition constants of 23 and 150 nM, respectively. Bicyclic peptides are up to 130 times more active and 19 times more proteolytically stable than their linear analogs without bismuth.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging the n&#8594;&#960;* Interaction in Alkene Isomerization by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fumarate to maleate (E&#8594;Z) isomerization was investigated to validate nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions as a driving force for contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization. A general protocol based on selective energy transfer catalysis was developed with inexpensive thioxanthone as a sensitizer for the conversion of diverse fumarate derivatives, including tetrasubstituted alkenes. The involvement of nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Examples of geometric alkene isomerization in nature are often limited to the net exergonic direction (&#916;G&#176;&lt;0), with the antipodal net endergonic processes (&#916;G&#176;&gt;0) comparatively under&#8208;represented. Inspired by the expansiveness of the maleate to fumarate (Z&#8594;E) isomerization in biochemistry, we investigated the inverse E&#8594;Z variant to validate nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions as a driving force for contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization. A general protocol involving selective energy transfer catalysis with inexpensive thioxanthone as a sensitizer (&#955;max=402&#8197;nm) is disclosed. Whilst in the enzymatic process nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions commonly manifest themselves in the substrate, these same interactions are shown to underpin directionality in the antipodal reaction by shortening the product alkene chromophore. The process was validated with diverse fumarate derivatives (&gt;30 examples, up to Z:E&gt;99:1), including the first examples of tetrasubstituted alkenes, and the involvement of nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Visualization of Proton Transport Pathways at Water&#8211;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a method for imaging aqueous proton transport with spatial resolution and observed the lateral transport of protons along the nanofluidic interface. The dynamics of proton transport can be further captured by quantitative analysis, thanks to the temporal resolution of this optical imaging technique.







Abstract
Probing proton transport is of vital importance for understanding cellular transport, surface catalysis and fuel cells. Conventional proton transport measurements rely on the use of electrochemical conductivity and do not allow for the direct visualization of proton transport pathways. The development of novel experimental techniques to spatiotemporally resolve proton transport is in high demand. Here, building upon the general conversion of aqueous proton flux into spatially resolved fluorescence signals, we optically visualize proton transport through nanopores and along hydrophilic interfaces. We observed that the fluorescence intensity increased at negative voltage due to lateral transport. Thanks to the temporal resolution of optical imaging, our technique further empowers the analysis of proton transport dynamics.

         <title>Concurrent Prebiotic Formation of Nucleoside&#8208;Amidophosphates and Nucleoside&#8208;Triphosphates Potentiates Transition from Abiotic to Biotic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DAP mediated prebiotic phosphorylation of nucleosides/nucleotides/oligonucleotides produces a spectrum of the corresponding mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri(amido)phosphorylated derivatives which are substrates for both prebiotic&#8208;oligomerization and biotic&#8208;polymerization/ligation. The compatibility of the phosphorylation and activation chemistry across a broad spectrum of (oligo)nucleos(t)ide structures suggests a smoother transition from chemistry to biology.







Abstract
Polymerization of nucleic acids in biology utilizes 5&#8242;&#8208;nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as substrates. The prebiotic availability of NTPs has been unresolved and other derivatives of nucleoside&#8208;monophosphates (NMPs) have been studied. However, this latter approach necessitates a change in chemistries when transitioning to biology. Herein we show that diamidophosphate (DAP), in a one&#8208;pot amidophosphorylation&#8208;hydrolysis setting converts NMPs into the corresponding NTPs via 5&#8242;&#8208;nucleoside amidophosphates (NaPs). The resulting crude mixture of NTPs are accepted by proteinaceous&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;polymerases as substrates for nucleic acid polymerization. This phosphorylation also operates at the level of oligonucleotides enabling ribozyme&#8208;mediated ligation. This one&#8208;pot protocol for simultaneous generation of NaPs and NTPs suggests that the transition from prebiotic&#8208;phosphorylation and oligomerization to an enzymatic processive&#8208;polymerization can be more continuous than previously anticipated.

         <title>Photoswitchable Nitrogen Superbases: Using Light for Reversible Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;controlled CO2 activation was achieved by the development of photoswitchable nitrogen superbases equipped with a photochromic dithienylethene unit. The reversible electrocyclic isomerization of the N&#8208;heterocyclic imine backbone is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of up to 8.7 units.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to alter the reactivity of Lewis bases is an intriguing tool for controlling chemical reactions. Reversible photoreactions associated with pronounced reactivity changes are particularly valuable in this regard. We herein report the first photoswitchable nitrogen superbases based on guanidines equipped with a photochromic dithienylethene unit. The resulting N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs) undergo reversible, near quantitative electrocyclic isomerization upon successive exposure to UV and visible irradiation, as demonstrated over multiple cycles. Switching between the ring&#8208;opened and ring&#8208;closed states is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of the NHIs by up to 8.7 units. Since only the ring&#8208;closed isomers are sufficiently basic to activate CO2 via the formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts, cycling between the two isomeric states enables the light&#8208;controlled capture and release of CO2.

         <title>Metathesis by Partner Interchange in &#963;&#8208;Bond Ligands: Expanding Applications of the &#963;&#8208;CAM Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;complex assisted metathesis mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence.







Abstract
In 2007 two of us defined the &#963;&#8208;Complex Assisted Metathesis mechanism (Perutz and Sabo&#8208;Etienne, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 2578&#8211;2592), that is, the &#963;&#8208;CAM concept. This new approach to reaction mechanisms brought together metathesis reactions involving the formation of a variety of metal&#8211;element bonds through partner&#8208;interchange of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes. The key concept that defines a &#963;&#8208;CAM process is a single transition state for metathesis that is connected by two intermediates that are &#963;&#8208;bond complexes while the oxidation state of the metal remains constant in precursor, intermediates and product. This mechanism is appropriate in situations where &#963;&#8208;bond complexes have been isolated or computed as well&#8208;defined minima. Unlike several other mechanisms, it does not define the nature of the transition state. In this review, we highlight advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence. We then draw on these examples to demonstrate that the scope of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism has expanded to classes of reaction not envisaged in 2007 (additional &#963;&#8208;bond ligands, agostic complexes, sp2&#8208;carbon, surfaces). Finally, we provide a critical comparison to alternative mechanisms for metathesis of metal&#8211;element bonds.

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of [1.1.1]Propellane for the Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The third way: the umpolung of nucleophilic [1.1.1]propellane into an electrophilic halogen bond complex enables the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) after attack of anilines and azoles. DFT calculations show that the halogen bond interaction helps avoiding the decomposition of the BCP cage. This approach opens a third avenue to access functionalised BCPs besides the better explored radical and anionic strategies.







Abstract
Strategies commonly used for the synthesis of functionalised bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) rely on the reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with anionic or radical intermediates. In contrast, electrophilic activation has remained a considerable challenge due to the facile decomposition of BCP cations, which has severely limited the applications of this strategy. Herein, we report the electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane in a halogen bond complex, which enables its reaction with electron&#8208;neutral nucleophiles such as anilines and azoles to give nitrogen&#8208;substituted BCPs that are prominent motifs in drug discovery. A detailed computational analysis indicates that the key halogen bonding interaction promotes nucleophilic attack without sacrificing cage stabilisation. Overall, our work rehabilitates electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane as a valuable strategy for accessing functionalised BCPs.

         <title>Azaphilones as Activation&#8208;Free Primary&#8208;Amine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation Reagents for Peptides, Proteins and Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Residue&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods for biomolecules are highly sought to expand the scope of their biological and medical applications. Inspired by the generation mechanism of natural vinylogous  &#947;  &#8208;pyridones (vPDNs), we have developed a novel unique azaphilone&#8208;based, activation&#8208;free primary amine&#8208;selective bioconjugation method for biomolecules. Our strategy allows facile functionalization of primary amine groups in peptides and proteins, including the clinically used therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, by generating a highly stable vPDN linkage. Excellent chemoselectivity toward primary amines also enables the azaphilone derivatives to specifically modify the lipid components of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while bypassing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and mammalian cells. The new method shows significant advantages including chemoselectivity, efficiency, flexibility and biocompatibility, and therefore provides a valuable addition to the current toolbox for biomolecule conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling syneresis of hydrogels using organic salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels can spontaneously undergo syneresis through fibre&#8208;fibre interactions and expel significant amounts of water upon aging. In this process, the hydrophobicity of fibres which regulates the 3D&#8208;rearrangement of the self&#8208;assembled structures during syneresis is important. Here, we show that we can control over the hydrophobic microenvironment of gels by incorporating organic salts into the gel fibre involving co&#8208;assembly enabling control of the macroscopic gel volume phase transition.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Melt&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of reprocessable and reprogrammable soft actuators is limited by the synthetic strategies, 3D&#8208;shaping capabilities, and small deformations. In this work, melt&#8208;processable supramolecular soft actuators based on segmented copolymers containing thiourethane and liquid crystal segments have been prepared via sequential thiol addition reactions in a one&#8208;pot approach using commercially available building blocks. The actuators demonstrated immediate, reversible response and weightlifting capabilities with large deformations up to 32%. Through exploiting the supramolecular cross&#8208;links, the material could be recycled and reprogrammed into 3D actuators and welded into an actuator assembly with different deformation modes. Our work offers a one&#8208;pot synthesis and straightforward melt&#8208;processable approach to prepare supramolecular soft actuators with large deformations that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanohook&#8208;Equipped Bionanocatalyst for Localized Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel bionanocatalysts have opened a new era in fighting multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. They can kill bacteria by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of chemicals like H2O2. However, ROSs&#8217; ultrashort diffusion distance limit their bactericidal activity. We present a nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst (Ni@Co&#8208;NC) with bacterial binding ability that shows robust ROS&#8208;generating capacity under physiological H2O2 levels. The Ni@Co&#8208;NC&#8217;s pH&#8208;dependent performance confines its effects to the biofilm microenvironment, leaving healthy tissue unaffected. Furthermore, it can generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation, enhancing its catalytic performance while achieving heat ablation against bacteria. With the Ni@Co&#8208;NC&#8217;s synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &gt;99.99%. More surprisingly, mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co&#8208;NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Environment Determined Reactant Adsorption Configuration for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Acetone Hydrogenation to Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In electrocatalysis, reactant and reaction intermediates&#8217; adsorption behavior plays a significant role in determining the catalyst&#8217;s selectivity to the target product. Currently, most adsorption configuration tunings were achieved by optimizing the electronic structures of specially designed catalysts. Here, we demonstrate a more widely applicable method to alter the adsorption configuration of multi&#8208;carbon containing reactants by no catalyst engineering but simply adjusting the local reaction environment of the catalyst surface. Using electrocatalytic acetone to propane hydrogenation (APH) as a model reaction and common commercial Pt   /   Pt&#8208;based materials as catalysts, we found local H  +  concentration can significantly influence the adsorption mode of acetone reactant, e.g. in vertical or flat mode, and target product&#8217;s selectivity. Electrocatalytic measurement combined with in&#8208;situ spectroscopic characterizations reveals that the vertically adsorbed acetone is favorable for propane production while the flatly adsorbed mode suppresses the reaction. Computation by density function theory (DFT) indicates that the H coverage on catalyst surface plays a decisive role in the adsorption configuration of acetone. The increased local acidity can facilitate the adsorption configuration of acetone from flat to vertical mode and suppress the competing hydrogen evaluation reaction, which consequently enhances the APH selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals: A Critical Overview of Experimental Elastic Tensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive overview of experimental elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals employs a rotation&#8208;invariant description of the Young's modulus to critically compare multiple observations and computational results. To encourage the wider use of experimental elastic constant tensors in studies of mechanical properties, outliers are clearly identified, resulting in a curated database of experimental results for molecular crystals.







Abstract
This review presents a critical and comprehensive overview of current experimental measurements of complete elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals. For a large fraction of these molecular crystals, detailed comparisons are made with elastic tensors obtained using the corrected small basis set Hartree&#8211;Fock method S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, and these are shown to be competitive with many of those obtained from more sophisticated density functional theory plus dispersion (DFT&#8208;D) approaches. These detailed comparisons between S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, experimental and DFT&#8208;D computed tensors make use of a novel rotation&#8208;invariant spherical harmonic description of the Young's modulus, and identify outliers among sets of independent experimental results. The result is a curated database of experimental elastic tensors for molecular crystals, which we hope will stimulate more extensive use of elastic tensor information&#8212;experimental and computational&#8212;in studies aimed at correlating mechanical properties of molecular crystals with their underlying crystal structure.

         <title>Atomistic Insights of Irreversible Li+ Intercalation in MnO2 Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithiation front region of one &#946;&#8208;MnO2 nanowire analyzed by in&#8197;situ TEM, where the MnO2/LiMnO2 interface featuring arrow&#8208;headed disordered regions, is disclosed with its atomic structure clearly captured. The findings have a bearing on MnO2 open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage.







Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 represents open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage. Its wide application is limited by its poor cycling stability, whose structural origin is unclear. We tracked the structure evolution of &#946;&#8208;MnO2 upon Li+ ion insertion/extraction by combining advanced in&#8197;situ diagnostic tools at both electrode level (synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering) and single&#8208;particle level (transmission electron microscopy). The instability is found to originate from a partially reversible phase transition between &#946;&#8208;MnO2 and orthorhombic LiMnO2 upon lithiation, causing cycling capacity decay.

         <title>A Biomimetic Approach for Spatially Controlled Cell Membrane Engineering Using Fusogenic Spherical Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we introduced the fusogenic spherical nucleic acid (fuso&#8208;SNA) to achieve spatially controlled cell membrane engineering with DNA by using a liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT) approach. We demonstrated asymmetric DNA modifications on the cell membrane with orthogonal functionalities on each side, realizing applications such as heterotypic cell assembly and intracellular metabolites detection.







Abstract
Engineering of the cell plasma membrane using functional DNA is important for studying and controlling cellular behaviors. However, most efforts to apply artificial DNA interactions on cells are limited to external membrane surface due to the lack of suitable synthetic tools to engineer the intracellular side, which impedes many applications in cell biology. Inspired by the natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we have developed a fusogenic spherical nucleic acid construct to realize robust DNA functionalization on both external and internal cell surfaces via liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT) strategy, which enables applications including the construction of heterotypic cell assembly for programmed signaling pathway and detection of intracellular metabolites. This approach can engineer cell membranes in a highly efficient and spatially controlled manner, allowing one to build anisotropic membrane structures with two orthogonal DNA functionalities.

         <title>Accessing Unsymmetrically Linked Heterocycles through Stereoselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solving alkynes of problems with palladium. A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aryl iodides with alkyne&#8208;tethered aryl nucleophiles is reported. This methodology unsymmetrically links heterocycles along a tetrasubstituted olefin with &gt;20:1 E/Z selectivity and up to 96&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy is presented to synthesize unsymmetrically linked heterocycles within stereoselective tetrasubstituted olefins. This reaction is proposed to occur via a vinyl&#8208;PdII intermediate capable of initiating the cyclization of various alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles. Products are formed in up to 96&#8201;% yield and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained using low catalyst loadings. This transformation was scalable up to 1&#8197;mmol and mechanistic studies suggest a syn&#8208;carbopalladation of the carbamoyl chloride followed by PdII&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles.

         <title>3D Binary Mesocrystals from Anisotropic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic nanoparticles into large superstructures is a key component in the research of novel metamaterials. While the formation of mono&#8208;phase mesocrystals has been achieved in recent years, the self&#8208;assembly of binary structures from such particles remained highly challenging. A simple method enables the formation of binary mesocrystals from anisotropic iron oxide and platinum nanocubes in two and three dimensions.







Abstract
Binary mesocrystals offer the combination of nanocrystal properties in an ordered superstructure. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous self&#8208;assembly of platinum and iron oxide nanocubes into micrometer&#8208;sized 3D&#8197;mesocrystals using the gas&#8208;phase diffusion technique. By the addition of minor amounts of a secondary particle type tailored to nearly identical size, shape and surface chemistry, we were able to promote a random incorporation of foreign particles into a self&#8208;assembling host lattice. The random distribution of the binary particle types on the surface and within its bulk has been visualized using advanced transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The 20&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m sized binary mesocrystals have been further characterized through wide and small angle scattering techniques to reveal a long&#8208;range ordering on the atomic scale throughout the crystal while showing clear evidence that the material consists of individual building blocks. Through careful adjustments of the crystallization parameters, we could further obtain a reverse superstructure, where incorporated particles and host lattice switch roles.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Specific Targeting of Ibrutinib: Introducing Electrostatic Antibody&#8208;Inhibitor Conjugates (AiCs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo evaluation of a vesicular ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5 hosting nanocarrier is reported. In&#8197;vivo, it shows a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and gave a significantly better response at much lower dosage than the original untargeted drug.







Abstract
Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that has been approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and is connected with toxicities. To minimize its toxicities, we linked ibrutinib to a cell&#8208;targeted, internalizing antibody. To this end, we synthesized a poly&#8208;anionic derivate, ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5, that retains full functionality. This anionic inhibitor is complexed by our anti&#8208;CD20&#8208;protamine targeting conjugate and free protamine, and thereby spontaneously assembles into an electrostatically stabilized vesicular nanocarrier. The complexation led to an accumulation of the drug driven by the CD20 antigen internalization to the intended cells and an amplification of its pharmacological effectivity. In&#8197;vivo, we observed a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and a significantly better response to lower doses compared to the original drug.

         <title>Supernova: A Deoxyribozyme that Catalyzes a Chemiluminescent Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial evolution was used to identify a light&#8208;producing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This catalyzes a chemiluminescent reaction in the presence of the 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate CDP&#8208;Star. Light production can also be coupled to ligand binding, suggesting that Supernova will be a useful addition to the toolkit of functional DNA parts.







Abstract
Functional DNA molecules are useful components in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. To expand the toolkit of functional DNA parts, in this study we used artificial evolution to identify a glowing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This deoxyribozyme transfers a phosphate from a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate to its 5&#8242; hydroxyl group, which triggers a chemiluminescent reaction and a flash of blue light. An engineered version of Supernova is only catalytically active in the presence of an oligonucleotide complementary to its 3&#8242; end, demonstrating that light production can be coupled to ligand binding. We anticipate that Supernova will be useful in a wide variety of applications, including as a signaling component in allosterically regulated sensors and in logic gates of molecular computers.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Hydrophobicity for Ultrafast Oil&#8211;Water Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2D robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability were synthesized by introducing mixed hydrophobic substituents. After coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, the superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating exhibits an excellent oil/water separation efficiency (&gt;99.5&#8201;%), high oil&#8208;permeation flux (2.84&#177;0.08)&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, high water&#8208;pressure resistance (&gt;15&#8197;kPa), and a high degree of reusability (&gt;50&#8197;cycles).







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great potentials for addressing the challenge of highly efficient oil&#8211;water separation, but they are restricted by the poor wettability and processability as crystalline membranes. Here we report the design and synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability, allowing the COF layers to be directly grown on the support surfaces. Three 2D COFs with AA or ABC stacking are prepared by condensation of triamines with fluorine and/or isopropyl groups and perfluorodialdehyde. They all show excellent tolerance to water, acid, and base, with water contact angles (CA) of 111.5&#8211;145.8&#176;. The two COFs with isopropyl and fluorine mixtures can grow as a coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, whereas the one with only fluorine substituents cannot. The superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating with water CA of up to 150.1&#176; displays high water&#8208;resistance and self&#8208;cleaning properties, enabling high oil&#8211;water separation performances with an efficiency of over 99.5&#8201;% and a permeation flux of 2.84&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, which are among the highest values reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Tardigrade Proteins Self&#8208;Assemble into Fibrous Gels in Response to Environmental Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational behaviour of an intrinsically disordered protein responsible for protecting tardigrades against extreme stress has been characterized. The protein assembles into fibres and fibrillar gels as a function of temperature and concentration. The disordered tails remain flexible within the gel cavities, which can encapsulate client proteins in their native state.







Abstract
Tardigrades are remarkable for their ability to survive harsh stress conditions as diverse as extreme temperature and desiccation. The molecular mechanisms that confer this unusual resistance to physical stress remain unknown. Recently, tardigrade&#8208;unique intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to play an essential role in tardigrade anhydrobiosis. Here, we characterize the conformational and physical behaviour of CAHS&#8208;8 from Hypsibius&#8197;exemplaris. NMR spectroscopy reveals that the protein comprises an extended central helical domain flanked by disordered termini. Upon concentration, the protein is shown to successively form oligomers, long fibres, and finally gels constituted of fibres in a strongly temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The helical domain forms the core of the fibrillar structure, with the disordered termini remaining highly dynamic within the gel. Soluble proteins can be encapsulated within cavities in the gel, maintaining their functional form. The ability to reversibly form fibrous gels may be associated with the enhanced protective properties of these proteins.

         <title>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis by Programmed Disassembly of Reticular Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clip&#8208;off Chemistry, a new approach to synthesizing molecules and materials based on the programmed de&#8208;reticulation and controlled etching at the molecular level in reticular materials, is introduced. Using this strategy, we have transformed two 3D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into two topologically distinct 3D MOFs, and one metal&#8208;organic polyhedra into a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle.







Abstract
Bond breaking is an essential process in chemical transformations and the ability of researchers to strategically dictate which bonds in a given system will be broken translates to greater synthetic control. Here, we report extending the concept of selective bond breaking to reticular materials in a new synthetic approach that we call Clip&#8208;off Chemistry. We show that bond&#8208;breaking in these structures can be controlled at the molecular level; is periodic, quantitative, and selective; is effective in reactions performed in either solid or liquid phases; and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion involving the entire bulk precursor sample. We validate Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by synthesizing two topologically distinct 3D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from two reported 3D MOFs, and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP). Clip&#8208;off Chemistry opens the door to the programmed disassembly of reticular materials and thus to the design and synthesis of new molecules and materials.

         <title>Reactivities of Interstitial Hydrides in a Cu11 Template: En Route to Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the reaction of the [Cu11H2{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3] template with Cu+ or Ag+ produces Cu12H2 and AgCu14H2 species in which the hydrides behave as Lewis bases, in the reaction with Au+, the hydrides act as reducing agents, leading to a luminescent, two&#8208;electron Au@Cu11 superatom, whose metal core has a defect fcc structure.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to surface hydrides, reactivities of interstitial hydrides are difficult to explore. When treated with a metal ion (Cu+, Ag+, and Au+), the stable CuI dihydride template [Cu11H2{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3] (H2Cu11) generates surprisingly three very different compounds, namely [CuH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3]+ (1), [AgH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6((C&#8801;CPh)6]+ (2), and [AuCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3Cl] (3). Compounds 1 and 2 are both MI species and maintain the same number of hydride ligands as their H2Cu11 precursor. Neutron diffraction revealed the first time a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal hydride coordination mode in the AgCu3 environment of 2. 3 has no hydride and exhibits a mixed&#8208;valent [AuCu11]10+ metal core, making it a two&#8208;electron superatom.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast to surface hydrides, reactivities of interstitial hydrides are difficult to explore. When treated with a metal ion (Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the stable Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; dihydride template [Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) generates surprisingly three very different compounds, namely [CuH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [AgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;((C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and [AuCu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are both M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species and maintain the same number of hydride ligands as their &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; precursor. Neutron diffraction revealed the first time a trigonal-pyramidal hydride coordination mode in the AgCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; environment of &lt;b&gt;2. 3&lt;/b&gt; has no hydride and exhibits a mixed-valent [AuCu&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;10+&lt;/sup&gt; metal core, making it a two-electron superatom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling of a [High Spin&#8212;Low Spin] &#8596; [Low Spin&#8212;High Spin] Equilibrium in Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron(II) Dinuclear Helicates Using Paramagnetic NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a binuclear complex with two spin crossover active ions, at least three different states are possible: fully high&#8208;spin [HS&#8208;HS] or low&#8208;spin [LS&#8208;LS] states that are commonly encountered and a relatively unusual intermediate [HS&#8208;LS] state. The binuclear iron(II) helicates show the exchange dynamics [HS&#8208;LS] &#8596; [LS&#8208;HS] on a millisecond timescale in such a broken&#8208;symmetry state.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover between high&#8208;spin (HS) and low&#8208;spin (LS) states of selected transition metal ions in polynuclear and polymeric compounds is behind their use as multistep switchable materials in breakthrough electronic and spintronic devices. We report the first successful attempt to observe the dynamics of a rarely found broken&#8208;symmetry spin state in binuclear complexes, which mixes the states [HS&#8208;LS] and [LS&#8208;HS] on a millisecond timescale. The slow exchange between these two states, which was identified by paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy in solutions of two spin&#8208;crossover iron(II) binuclear helicates that are amenable to molecular design, opens a path to double quantum dot cellular automata for information storage and processing.

         <title>Correlating Reaction Dynamics and Size Change during the Photomechanical Transformation of 9&#8208;Methylanthracene Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a nonlinear kinetic model for crystal reactions allows us to quantify for the first time how the kinetics depend on sample morphology. Furthermore, the quantitative connection between molecular reaction kinetics and mechanical response in well&#8208;defined single crystals provides a new benchmark for analyzing these photomechanical materials.







Abstract
Photomechanical molecular crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. In this study, we find that the use of high&#8208;quality single crystals of 9&#8208;methylanthracene (9MA) leads to more homogeneous reaction kinetics than that previously seen for polycrystalline samples, presumably due to a lower concentration of defects. Furthermore, simultaneous observation of absorbance and shape changes in single crystals revealed that the dimensional change mirrors the reaction progress, resulting in a smooth expansion of 7&#8201;% along the c&#8208;axis that is linearly correlated with reaction progress. The same expansion dynamics are highly reproducible across different single crystal samples. Organic single crystals exhibit well&#8208;defined linear expansions during 100&#8201;% photoconversion, suggesting that this class of solid&#8208;state phase change material could be used for actuation.

         <title>Vacancy Modulating Co3Sn2S2 Topological Semimetal for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 cathode was applied in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries with a discharge plateau around 1.5&#8197;V. Co3Sn1.8S2 activates Sn2+ and provides active sites with impressive charge&#8208;storage capabilities and fast kinetic processes. The material has high structural stability and conductivity, and an ionic diffusion rate that achieves appreciable cycling stability and capacity retention.







Abstract
Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with high electrical conductivity and suitable carrier density near the Fermi level are enticing candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), meriting from topological surface states (TSSs). We propose a WSM Co3Sn2S2 cathode for AZIBs showing a discharge plateau around 1.5&#8197;V. By introducing Sn vacancies, extra redox peaks from the Sn4+/Sn2+ transition appear, which leads to more Zn2+ transfer channels and active sites promoting charge&#8208;storage kinetics and Zn2+ storage capability. Co3Sn1.8S2 achieves a specific energy of 305&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 (0.2 Ag&#8722;1) and a specific power of 4900&#8197;Wkg&#8722;1 (5 Ag&#8722;1). Co3Sn1.8S2 and ZnxCo3Sn1.8S2 benefit from better conductivity at lower temperatures; the quasi&#8208;solid Co3Sn1.8S2//Zn battery delivers 126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.6 Ag&#8722;1) at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and a cycling stability over 3000&#8197;cycles (2 Ag&#8722;1) with 85&#8201;% capacity retention at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A Defective Nanotube Molecule of C552H496N24 with Pyridinic and Pyrrolic Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gigantic molecule composed of 1072 atoms was designed and synthesized to install two types of nitrogen dopants in a defective nanotube molecule. Charge&#8208;transfer interactions originating from the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen dopants were disclosed by solution&#8208;phase analyses, and 3&#8208;nm molecular structures and a unique helical assembly were revealed by crystallographic analyses.







Abstract
A 3&#8208;nm molecule comprising a cylindrical core and cross&#8208;shaped rims was designed and synthesized by developing a modular synthetic route. By using a cyclic precursor from previous studies as a starting material, multiple carbazole units were installed at the rims of the defective cylinder. The defective cylinder was synthetically doped with two types of nitrogen atoms, that is, pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms, which resulted in solvatochromic shifts in fluorescence by charge&#8208;transfer interactions. The structure of the large, C552H496N24 molecule was fully disclosed by crystallographic analyses, and the unique helical arrangement of nitrogen&#8208;doped cylinders in the crystal was revealed.

&lt;p&gt;A gigantic molecule composed of 1072 atoms was designed and synthesized to install two types of nitrogen dopants in a defective nanotube molecule. Charge-transfer interactions originating from the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen dopants were disclosed by solution-phase analyses, and 3-nm molecular structures and a unique helical assembly were revealed by crystallographic analyses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3-nm molecule comprising a cylindrical core and cross-shaped rims was designed and synthesized by developing a modular synthetic route. By using a cyclic precursor from previous studies as a starting material, multiple carbazole units were installed at the rims of the defective cylinder. The defective cylinder was synthetically doped with two types of nitrogen atoms, that is, pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms, which resulted in solvatochromic shifts in fluorescence by charge-transfer interactions. The structure of the large, C&lt;sub&gt;552&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;496&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; molecule was fully disclosed by crystallographic analyses, and the unique helical arrangement of nitrogen-doped cylinders in the crystal was revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Clinical Development of Metal Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic therapy has complemented traditional cancer treatment modalities. Despite its success, the clinically applied photosensitizers are not ideal. To overcome their limitations increasing research efforts have been devoted towards the incorporation of a metal ion. In this Minireview, the clinical status of metal&#8208;containing compounds as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy is reviewed.







Abstract
Cancer has emerged over the last decades as one of the deadliest diseases in the world. Among the most commonly used techniques (i.e. surgery, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy), increasing attention has been devoted towards photodynamic therapy. However, the vast majority of clinically applied photosensitizers are not ideal and associated with several limitations including poor aqueous solubility, poor photostability and slow clearance from the body, causing photosensitivity. In an effort to overcome these drawbacks, much attention has been devoted towards the incorporation of a metal ion. Herein, the clinical development of metal&#8208;containing compounds including Purlytin&#174;, Lutrin&#174;/Antrin&#174;, Photosens&#174;, TOOKAD&#174; soluble or TLD&#8208;1433 is critically reviewed.

         <title>Zr(OH)4&#8208;Catalyzed Controllable Selective Oxidation of Anilines to Azoxybenzenes, Azobenzenes and Nitrosobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr(OH)4 can catalyze the selective oxidation of anilines to azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes and nitrosobenzenes for a wide range of substrates. Control experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the activation of H2O2 and O2 can be attributed to the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)4, respectively.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of aniline to metastable and valuable azoxybenzene, azobenzene or nitrosobenzene has important practical significance in organic synthesis. However, uncontrollable selectivity and laborious synthesis of the expensive required catalysts severely hinders the uptake of these reactions in industrial settings. Herein, we have pioneered the discovery of Zr(OH)4 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst capable of the selective oxidation of aniline, using either peroxide or O2 as oxidant, to selectively obtain various azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes, as well as nitrosobenzenes, by simply regulating the reaction solvent, without the need for additives. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the activation of H2O2 and O2 is primarily achieved by the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)4, respectively. The present work provides an economical and environmentally friendly strategy for the selective oxidation of aniline in industrial applications.

         <title>Dual Nanoislands on Ni/C Hybrid Nanosheet Activate Superior Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Efficiency H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array with dual&#8208;active nanoisland sites is reported. One type of island represents the bare Ni particle surface, the other consists of core&#8211;shell Ni@C structures (denoted as Ni&#8208;C HNSA). The catalyst achieves efficient hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting, showing its potential for practical applications.







Abstract
Clean hydrogen evolution through electrochemical water splitting underpins various innovative approaches to the pursuit of sustainable energy conversion technologies, but it is blocked by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has been considered as one of the most promising substitute for OER to improve the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we construct novel dual nanoislands on Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array: one kind of island represents the part of bare Ni particle surface, while the other stands for the part of core&#8211;shell Ni@C structure (denoted as Ni&#8208;C HNSA), in which exposed Ni atoms and Ni&#8208;decorated carbon shell perform as active sites for HzOR and HER respectively. As a result, when the current density reaches 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the working potentials are merely &#8722;37&#8197;mV for HER and &#8208;20 mV for HzOR. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer exhibits superb activity that only requires an ultrasmall cell voltage of 0.14&#8197;V to achieve 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Structure of an Atomically Dispersed Zinc Electrocatalyst: Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible alteration of an 2&#8197;e&#8722;/4&#8197;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway was discovered by tuning the coordination environment of Zn single sites derived from MOF&#8208;5 by varying the functional group of ligands within the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursors. The formed ZnN4 follows a 4&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway, while ZnO3C achieves a maximum H2O2 production rate of 340&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Accurately regulating the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization, but challenging. A flexible alteration of ORR pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity ORR can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of the catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O&#8208; and C&#8208;coordination structure (ZnO3C) or N&#8208;coordination structure (ZnN4) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOF precursors. The coordination environment of as&#8208;prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN4 catalyst processes a 4&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway to generate H2O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO3C catalyst processes a 2&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway to generate H2O2 with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Calculations reveal that decreased electron density around Zn in ZnO3C lowers the d&#8208;band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2&#8197;e&#8722; ORR.

         <title>An Exceptional Thermally Induced Four&#8208;State Nonlinear Optical Switch Arising from Stepwise Molecular Dynamic Changes in a New Hybrid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple hybrid salt has been synthesized that exhibits reversible multistep phase transitions and an unprecedented thermally induced three&#8208;step &#8220;silent&#8208;medium&#8208;low&#8208;high&#8221; second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation switching behavior. This behavior arises from complex and stepwise molecular dynamic changes of the polar organic cations.







Abstract
Switching materials in channels of nonlinear optics (NLOs) are of particular interest in NLO material science. Numerous crystalline NLO switches based on structural phase transition have emerged, but most of them reveal a single&#8208;step switch between two different second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) states, and only very rare cases involve three or more SHG states. Herein, we report a new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid salt, (Me3NNH2)2[CdI4], which is an unprecedented case of a reversible three&#8208;step NLO switch between SHG&#8208;silent, &#8208;medium, &#8208;low, and &#8208;high states, with high contrasts of 25.5/4.3/9.2 in a temperature range of 213&#8211;303&#8197;K. By using the combined techniques of variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses, dielectric constants, solid&#8208;state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Hirshfeld surface analyses, we disclose that this four&#8208;state switchable SHG behavior is highly associated with the stepwise&#8208;changed molecular dynamics of the polar organic cations. This finding demonstrates well the complexity of molecular dynamics in simple hybrid salts and their potential in designing new advanced multistep switching materials.

         <title>Nanoconfinement Engineering over Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Structured Copper towards Efficient Electrocatalytical C&#8208;C coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfinement provides a promising solution to promote electrocatalytic C&#8208;C coupling, by dramatically altering the diffusion kinetics to ensure a high local concentration of C1&#160;intermediates for carbon dimerization. Herein, under the guidance of finite&#8208;element method simulations&#160;results, a series of Cu2O hollow multi&#8208;shell structures (HoMSs) with tunable shell numbers were synthesized via Ostwald ripening. When applied in CO2&#160;electroreduction (CO2RR), the in&#8208;situ formed Cu HoMSs showed a positive correlation between shell numbers and selectivity for C2+&#160;products, reaching a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3% at a conversion rate of 513.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7 mA cm&#8208;2 in neutral electrolyte.&#160;Mechanism studies clarified the confinement effect of HoMSs that superposition of Cu shells leads to a higher coverage of localized CO adsorbate inside the cavity for enhanced dimerization. This work provides valuable insights for delicate design of efficient C&#8208;C coupling catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Assisted Single C&#8211;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones using Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light photoredox catalytic method for the selective cleavage of single strong C&#8211;F bond in trifluoromethyl ketones is reported. Single electron reduction of trifluoromethyl ketones generates difluoromethyl radicals which can be engaged in intermolecular C&#8211;C bond formation with  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;  N  &#8208;arylmethacrylamides to furnish fluorine&#8208;containing oxindole derivatives in good yields. The reaction shows excellent chemoselectivity with good functional group tolerance under mild conditions. 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent plays a critical role for the selective single C&#8211;F bond cleavage. High&#8208;level DFT calculations are depicted to shed light on the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering Chain Flexibility of Aliphatic Polyesters for Yellow&#8208;green Clusteroluminescence in 38% Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of non&#8208;conjugated polymers with long&#8208;wavelength emission and high quantum yield (QY) is still a huge challenge. Herein, we report the first example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8208;green clusteroluminescence (CL) and a high QY of 38%. We discovered that the polyester P3 with balanced flexibility and rigidity showed the longest CL wavelength and highest QY. Systematically photophysical characterization unravel the key role of ester cluster in the CL and the cluster formation via the aggregate of ester units was visualized. Moreover, P3 was demonstrated to be a highly selective, quick&#8208;responsive (~1.2 min) and sensitive detector (detection limit is 0.78 &#956;M) for irons owing to the fast disassociation of clusters by irons. This work not only gains further mechanistic insight into CL but also provides a new strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;wavelength CL, meanwhile, enlightens the glorious application prospect of luminescent polyester.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Natural Peptide Ligands to the Neuropeptide Y5 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The binding mode of natural peptide ligands to the Y  5  G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (Y  5  R), an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, is largely unknown. Here, we apply complementary biochemical and computational approaches, including scanning of the receptor surface with a genetically encoded crosslinker, Ala&#8208;scanning of the ligand and double&#8208;cycle mutagenesis, to map interactions in the ligand&#8208;receptor interface. We incorporate the experimental data into a structural model of the NPY&#8208;Y  5  R complex. In the model, the carboxyl (C)&#8208;terminus of bound NPY is placed close to the extracellular loop (ECL)&#160;3, whereas the characteristic &#945;&#8208;helical segment of the ligand drapes over ECL1 and is tethered towards ECL2 by a hydrophobic cluster. We further show that the other two natural ligands of Y  5  R, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) dock to the receptor in a similar pose.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing hydrogen binding on Ru sites with RuCo alloy nanosheets for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, with considerable performance and desirable cost, become highly concerned candidates to replace platinum (Pt) in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hydrogen binding at Ru sites (Ru&#8208;H) is an important factor limiting the HER activity. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that the essence of Ru&#8208;H binding energy is the strong interaction between the 4dz  2  orbital of Ru and 1s orbital of H. The charge transfer between Ru sites and substrates (Co and Ni) causes the appropriate downward shift of the 4dz  2  &#8208;band center of Ru, which results in a Gibbs free energy of 0.022 eV for H* in RuCo system, much decrease compared to 0.133 eV in pure Ru system. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally confirmed using RuCo alloy nanosheets (RuCo ANSs). They were prepared via fast co&#8208;precipitation method followed with a mild electrochemical reduction. Structure characterizations reveal that the Ru atoms are embed into Co substrate as isolated active sites with the planar symmetric and Z&#8208;direction asymmetric coordination structure, obtaining an optimal 4dz  2  modulated electronic structure. Hydrogen sensor and temperature program desorption (TPD) tests demonstrate the enhanced Ru&#8208;H interactions in RuCo ANSs than pure Ru nanoparticles. As a result, the RuCo ANSs reach an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA/cm  2  and a Tafel slope of 20.6 mV/dec in 1 M KOH, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C. This holistic work provides a new insight to promote alkaline HER by optimizing metal&#8208;H binding energy of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Biasing the Hierarchy Motifs of Nanotoroids: from 1D Nanotubes to 2D Porous Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical organization of self&#8208;assembled structures into superstructures is omnipresent in Nature but has been rarely achieved in synthetic molecular assembly due to the absence of clear structural rules. We herein report the self&#8208;assembly of scissor&#8208;shaped azobenzene dyads which form discrete nanotoroids that further organize into 2D porous networks. The steric demand of the peripheral aliphatic units diminishes the trend of the azobenzene dyad to constitute stackable nanotoroids in solution, thus affording isolated (unstackable) nanotoroids upon cooling. Upon drying, these nanotoroids organize at graphite surface to form well&#8208;defined 2D porous networks. The photoirradiation with UV and visible light enabled reversible dissociation and reconstruction of nanotoroids through the efficient  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  isomerization of azobenzene moieties in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Attached&#8208;Ring Synthesis via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions: A Short Formal Synthesis of Merrilactone A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to control the diastereoselectivity of bond formation at a prochiral attached&#8208;ring bridgehead is reported. An unusual stereodivergent Michael reaction relies on basic vs. Lewis acidic conditions and non&#8208;covalent interactions to control&#160;re&#8208;&#160;vs.&#160;si&#8208;&#160;facial selectivity en route to fully&#8208;substituted attached&#8208;rings. This divergency reflects differential engagement of one rotational isomer of the attached&#8208;ring system. The successful synthesis of an&#160;erythro&#160;subtarget diastereomer ultimately leads to a short formal synthesis of merrilactone A.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic kinetic sensitization of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds &#8211; Access to medium&#8208;sized rings via a De Mayo&#8208;type ring expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated two&#8208;carbon ring expansion of  &#946;  &#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with unactivated olefins providing facile access to medium&#8208;sized rings. Selective sensitization of the substoichiometric enol tautomer enables reactivity with substrates incompatible with the classical De Mayo&#8208;reaction conditions. Key to success is the identification of the metal&#8208;based sensitizer  fac  &#8208;[Ir(CF  3  &#8208;pmb)  3  ], which possesses a high triplet excited state energy of 73.3 kcal mol  &#8211;1  . This exactly falls in the range between the triplet energies of the enol and keto tautomer, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic sensitization. Demonstrating the applicability of  fac  &#8208;[Ir(CF  3  &#8208;pmb)  3  ] as a photocatalyst in organic synthesis for the first time, we describe a two&#8208;step photocycloaddition&#8208;ring&#8208;opening cascade with  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, &#8208;diketones and &#8208;ketoamides. The mechanism is corroborated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, as well as further experimental and computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conjugated Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight Oligoparaphenylene Nanohoop with Adaptive Cavities Derived from Cyclooctatetrathiophene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fully conjugated figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight nanohoop is presented with facile synthesis. The molecule&#8217;s lemniscular skeleton features the combination of two strained oligoparaphenylene loops and a flexible cyclooctatetrathiophene core. Its rigid yet guest&#8208;adaptive cavities enable the formation of the peanut&#8208;like 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes with C  60  or C  70  , which have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and characterized in solution. Further computational studies suggest notable geometric variations and non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cavities upon binding with different fullerenes, as well as the overall conjugation comparable to cycloparaphenylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Single Atom Incorporated in Ruthenium Oxide Sphere: A Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for HER and OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly active and stable bifunctional noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial goal for clean and renewable energy, which still remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient and stable catalyst comprising Co single atom incorporated in RuO2 sphere for HER and OER, in which Co single atom in the RuO2 sphere were confirmed by XAS, AC&#8208;STEM, and DFT. This tailoring strategy uses Co single atom to modify the electronic structures of the surrounding Ru atoms and thereby remarkably elevates the electrocatalytic activities. The catalyst requires ultralow overpotentials, 45 mV for HER and 200 mV for OER, to deliver 10 mA/cm2 current density. The theoretical calculations reveal that the energy barriers for HER and OER are lowered after incorporation of cobalt single atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Cationic Low&#8208;Coordinate Tetrylenes: Highly Lewis Acidic &#963;&#8208;Donor Ligands in Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel non&#8208;innocent ligand class, namely cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine&#8208;functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni  0  complexes, [  PhR  DippENi(PPh  3  )  3  ]  +  (  4a/b  (Ge) and  5  (Sn);  PhR  Dipp = {[Ph  2  PCH  2  SiR  2  ](Dipp)N}  &#8208;  ; R = Ph,  i  Pr; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ). The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8208;E&#8208;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic E  II  centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH  3  . Further, the Ge  II  centre in  4a/b  readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF  6  ]  &#8208;  to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex  PhR  DippGe(F)Ni(PPh  3  )  3  9  , despite this Ge  II  centre simultaneously being a  &#963;  &#8208;donating ligand towards Ni  0  . Alongside the observed catalytic ability of  4  and  5  in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Rhamnolipid Toxin by Redox Liposome Single Impact Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of Rhamnolipid virulence factor produced by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  involved in nosocomial infections is reported by using the redox liposome single impact electrochemistry. Redox liposomes based on 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine as a pure phospholipid and potassium ferrocyanide as an encapsulated redox content are designed for using the interaction of the target toxin with the lipid membrane as a sensing strategy. The electrochemical sensing principle is based on the weakening of the liposomes lipid membrane upon interaction with Rhamnolipid toxin which leads upon impact at an ultramicroelectrode to the breakdown of the liposomes and the release/electrolysis of its encapsulated redox probe. We present as a proof of concept the sensitive and fast sensing of a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid which is detected after less than 30 minutes of incubation with the liposomes, by the appearing of current spikes in the chronoamperometry measurement.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Ion Flux and Smart Gating Nanofluidic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic ion transport holds high promise in bio&#8208;sensing and energy conversion applications. However, smart nanofluidic devices with high ion flux and modulable ion transport capabilities remain to be realised. Herein, we demonstrate smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (2D COF) membranes with vertically aligned nanochannel arrays that achieved a 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher ion flux compared with that of conventional single&#8208;channel nanofluidic devices. The surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion conductance is dominant for electrolyte concentration up to 0.01 M. Moreover, owing to the customisable pH&#8208;responsivity of imine and phenol hydroxyl groups, the COF&#8208;DT membranes attained an actively modulable ion transport with a high pH&#8208;gating on/off ratio of ~100. The customisable structure and rich chemistry of COF materials will offer a promising platform for manufacturing nanofluidic devices with modifiable ion/molecular transport features.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lateral Flow Test for Staphylococcus aureus in Nasal Mucus Using a New DNAzyme as the Recognition Element</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological matrices remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the selection and optimization of a new DNAzyme for  Staphylococcus aureus  (SA) and the use of the DNAzyme to develop a simple lateral flow device (LFD) for detection of SA in nasal mucus. The DNAzyme was generated by  in vitro  selection using a crude extra/intracellular mixture derived from SA, which could be used directly for simple solution or paper&#8208;based fluorescence assays for SA. The DNAzyme was further modified to produce a DNA cleavage fragment that acted as a bridging element to bind DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles to the test line of a LFD, producing a simple colorimetric dipstick test. The LFD was evaluated with nasal mucus samples spiked with SA, and demonstrated that SA detection was possible in minutes with minimal sample processing.</dc:description>

         <title>M&#246;bius Zn(II)&#8208;Hexaphyrins Bearing a Chiral Coordinating Arm: A Chiroptical Switch Featuring P/M Twist Inversion Controlled by Achiral Effectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By their conformational flexibility, M&#246;bius aromatic hexaphyrins provide a dynamic chirality attractive to develop stimuli responsive systems such as chiroptical switches. A regular [28]hexaphyrin has been equipped with a chiral coordinating arm to achieve transfer of chirality from a fix stereogenic element to the dynamic M&#246;bius one. The arm allows straightforward formation of labile monometallic Zn(II) complexes with an exogenous ligand, either a carboxylato or an amino with opposite  inwards  /  outwards  orientations relative to the M&#246;bius ring. As a corollary, the chiral coordinating arm is constrained over the ring or laterally, inducing opposite  P  and  M  M&#246;bius configurations with unprecedented high stereoselectivity (diast. excess greater than 95 %). By tuning the transfer of chirality, these achiral effectors generate electronic circular dichroism spectra with bisignate Cotton effect of opposite signs. Switching between distinct chiroptical states was ultimately achieved in mild conditions owing to ligand exchange, with high robustness (10 cycles).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe  3+  complexes in aqueous solution can exist as discrete mononuclear species or multinuclear magnetically coupled species. Stimuli&#8208;driven change to Fe  3+  speciation represents a powerful mechanistic basis for magnetic resonance sensor technology, but ligand design strategies to exert precision control of aqueous Fe  3+  magnetostructural properties are entirely underexplored. In pursuit of this objective, we rationally designed a ligand to strongly favor a dinuclear &#181;&#8208;oxo&#8208;bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled complex, but which undergoes carboxylesterase mediated transformation to a mononuclear high&#8208;spin Fe  3+  chelate resulting in substantial T  1  &#8208;relaxivity increase. The data communicated demonstrate proof of concept for a novel and effective strategy to exert biochemical control over aqueous Fe  3+  magnetic, structural, and relaxometric properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Embedded Approach to Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Isoelectronic Structures for Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Embedding heteroatoms into the main backbones of polymeric materials has become an efficient tool for tailoring their structures and improving their properties. However, owing to comparatively harsh heteroatom&#8208;doping conditions, this has rarely been explored in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein,  upon Aldol condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium salt with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde, a two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was achieved, which was further converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacement of oxonium ions with nitrogen atoms under ammonia treatment. The two heteroatom&#8208;embedded COFs are conceptually isoelectronic with each other, featuring similar geometric structures but different electronic structures, rendering them capable of catalyzing the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component synthesis of tri&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives with good recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Diammonium Molecular Configuration&#8208;Induced Regulation of Crystal Orientation and Carrier Dynamics for Highly Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) mixed perovskites combine the advantages containing superior stability of 2D perovskite and excellent efficiency of 3D perovskite by introducing organic spacer cations. However, the effects from the molecular configuration of diammonium spacer cations on 2D/3D perovskite properties are still unclear. Here, we firstly investigated systematically the mechansim of molecular configuration&#8208;induced regulation of crystallization kinetic and carrier dynamics by employing various diammonium molecules to construct Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;type 2D/3D perovskites to further facilitating the photovoltaic performance.

As a consequence, a dramatically improved device efficiency of 22.68% is achieved with excellent mositure stability.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multifunctional Carbon&#8208;Based Nanoparticle&#8208;supported Dispersed Cu2+ Disrupts Redox Homeostasis to Enhance CDT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In chemodynamic therapy (CDT), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production plays an important role for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. However, the high levels of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells consume the ROS, directly reducing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized carbon&#8208;based nanoparticle (Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs) using one&#8208;pot strategy, which consume GSH  via  redox reactions to produce Cu+  that catalyze H2O2  to produce &#183;OH, thus the ROS level was observably increased through this synergistic effect.  In vivo  experiments further revealed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs could effectively inhibit tumor growth. Additionally, Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs can affect the activity of some protein sulfhydryl groups in cells, which was assessed by rdTOP&#8208;ABPP assay. In general, this study not only provides a potential CDT drug, but also provides a strategy for one&#8208;pot synthesis of multifunctional nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multi&#8209;wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective peak wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus, promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed methodology provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D&#160;nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>HFIP Mediates a Direct C&#8211;C Coupling between Michael Acceptors and Eschenmoser&#8217;s salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct C&#8211;C coupling process merging Michael acceptors and Eschenmoser&#8217;s salt is presented. Albeit reminiscent of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction, this process requires no Lewis base catalyst. The underlying mechanism could be unveiled by a combination of kinetic, isotopic labelling experiments as well as computational investigations, showcasing the critical role of HFIP as a superior mediator for proton transfer events as well as the decisive role of the halide counterion.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination at Tin(I) via Hemi&#8208;Lability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of a distannyne supported by a pincer ligand bearing pendant amine donors that is capable of reversibly activating E&#8211;H bonds at one or both of the tin centres through dissociation of the hemi&#8208;labile N&#8211;Sn donor/acceptor interactions. This chemistry can be exploited to sequentially (and reversibly) assemble mixed&#8208;valence chains of tin atoms of the type ArSn{Sn(Ar)H}  n  SnAr (  n  = 1, 2). The experimentally observed (decreasing) propensity towards chain growth with increasing chain length can be rationalized both thermodynamically and kinetically by the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the &#8211;Sn(Ar)H&#8211; backbone units generated via oxidative addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Responsive Jamming of Nanoparticle Dense Suspensions towards Macroscopic Liquid&#8208;Solid Switchable Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Nanoparticle aggregation for constructing functional materials has shown enormous advantages in various applications. Most efforts focused on ordered nanoparticle aggregation for specific functions but often limited in irreversible aggregation processes due to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Herein, we report a reversible disordered aggregation of SiO  2  &#8208;PNIPAAm nanoparticles (SPNPs) through thermo&#8208;responsive jamming, obtaining smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials. The smart materials can display a switch between liquid&#8208;like state and solid&#8208;like state responding to temperature change. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs. Notably, the materials at solid&#8208;like state show anti&#8208;impact property and can withstand the impact of a steel sphere with a speed of 328 cm/s. We envision that this finding offers inspirations to design smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials for impact protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Development of a Bioorthogonal, Visualizable and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important endogenous gasotransmitter, but the targeted delivery and real&#8208;time feedback of exogenous H2S are still challenging. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) compound, which can react with a strained alkyne via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and the retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of H2S, and a thiophene derivative with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H2S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1) in&#8208;situ controllable H2S release, (2) concomitant fluorescence response, and (3) mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.</dc:description>
