         <title>Pd Loaded NiCo Hydroxides for Biomass Electrooxidation: Understanding the Synergistic Effect of Proton Deintercalation and Adsorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key issue in the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is to understand the synergistic mechanism involving the protons deintercalation of catalyst and the adsorption of the substrate. In this study, a Pd/NiCo catalyst was fabricated by modifying Pd clusters onto a Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 support, in which the introduction of Co induced lattice distortion and optimized the energy band structure of Ni sites, while the Pd clusters with an average size of 1.96 nm exhibited electronic interactions with NiCo support, resulting in electron transfer from Pd to Ni sites. The resulting Pd/NiCo exhibited low onset potential of 1.32 V and achieved a current density of 50 mA/cm2 at only 1.38 V. Compared to unmodified Ni(OH)2, the Pd/NiCo achieved an 8.3&#8208;fold increase in peak current density. DFT calculations and in&#8208;situ XAFS revealed that the Co sites affected the conformation and band structure of neighboring Ni sites through CoO6 octahedral distortion, reducing the proton deintercalation potential of Pd/NiCo and promoting the production of Ni3+&#8208;O active species accordingly. The involvement of Pd decreased the electronic transfer impedance, and thereby accelerated Ni3+&#8208;O formation. Moreover, the Pd clusters enhanced the adsorption of HMF through orbital hybridization, kinetically promoting the contact and reaction of HMF with Ni3+&#8208;O.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis with Anomalous Chloride Promoted Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly selective and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is the bottleneck for direct seawater splitting because of side reactions primarily caused by chloride ions (Cl&#8208;). Most studies about OER catalysts in seawater focus on the repulsion of the Cl&#8208; to reduce its negative effects. Herein, we demonstrate that the absorption of Cl&#8208; on the specific site of a popular OER electrocatalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH), does not have a significant negative impact; rather, it is beneficial for its activity and stability enhancement in natural seawater. A set of in situ characterization techniques reveals that the adsorption of Cl&#8208; on the desired Fe site suppresses Fe leaching, and creates more OER&#8208;active Ni sites, improving the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability and activity simultaneously. Therefore, we achieve direct alkaline seawater electrolysis for the very first time on a commercial&#8208;scale alkaline electrolyser (AE, 120 cm2 electrode area) using the NiFe LDH anode. The new alkaline seawater electrolyser exhibits a reduction in electricity consumption by 20.7 % compared to the alkaline purified water&#8208;based AE using commercial Ni catalyst, achieving excellent durability for 100 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Aldol Condensation for the&#160;Construction of&#160;Organic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldol condensation is a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable method, offering advantages of low complexity, substrate universality, and high efficiency. Over the past decade, it has become popular for creating next&#8208;generation organic functional materials, particularly rigid rod conjugated (semi)conductors. This review focuses on conjugated small&#8208;molecules, oligomers and polymeric (semi)conductors synthesized through aldol condensation, with emphasis on their remarkable features in advancing n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs) as well as NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. Coherence character, optical properties, microstructure, and chain conformation are investigated to understand material&#8208;properties relationships. Future applications and challenges in this area are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn = 361.8 kg/mol, &#393; &lt; 1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.</dc:description>

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidically Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the natural confined enzyme on fluidic cell membrane, afluidically confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamers&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system with accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER can rapidly identified target cells in only 20 min, and achieved over 80% recognition efficiency with only 0.1% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and high selectivity of 97.1%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA = pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical NiH&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling of Alkyl Halides and Alkyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes for the construction of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bonds is firstly reported. Notably, alkyl halides serve dual function as coupling substrates and as hydrogen sources to generate NiH species under electrochemical conditions. The tunable nature of this reaction is realized by introducing an intramolecular coordinating group to the substrate, where the product can be easily adjusted to give the desired branched product. The method proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate scope, and affords moderate to excellent yields with over 70 examples, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug derivatives. Mechanistic insights offer evidence for an electrochemically driven coupling process. The sp3&#8208;carbon&#8211;halogen bonds can be activated through single electron transfer (SET) by the nickel catalyst in its low valence state, generated by cathodic reduction, and the generation of NiH species from alkyl halides is pivotal to this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergetic Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Sites on Organic Electrode Material for Robust and High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their sustainability and structural tunability. However, many OEMs suffer from low specific capacity and poor cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule called 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN&#8208;6OH) with catechol/ortho&#8208;quinone coupling functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. Through extensive analysis using density functional theory (DFT) calculation, ATR&#8208;FTIR, and Raman techniques, we have determined that the abundant coupling function groups and imine redox&#8208;active moieties on HATN&#8208;6OH enable a nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, resulting in a high specific capacity for sodium ion storage. Furthermore, the &#960;&#8208;&#960; coupling interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN&#8208;6OH molecules contribute to its resilient structural and chemical stability during cycling. As a result, our HATN&#8208;6OH electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacity (554 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1), excellent rate capability (202 mA h g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1), and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance (73% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1) in SIBs. This study highlights the importance of synergistic coupling of redox&#8208;active sites on OEMs in simultaneously enhancing capacity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Control of Carbon Nanoparticles via Simple Anion&#8208;Directed Strategy for Precise Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. And based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to  interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. Interestingly, the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs gradually enhances as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient up to 0.90.This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescence probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the &#8220;Solid&#8211;Liquid&#8211;Solid&#8221; Conversion Reaction via Bifunctional Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life Potassium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8211;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3 mol L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8211;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Enhancing Curcumin&#8208;Based Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Curcumin (Cur) has been clinically used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment by the means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and immune microenvironment regulation. However, this compound has a poor water solubility and moderate antioxidative activity, favoring no further broadened application. Metal complexes of curcumin such as zinc&#8208;curcumin (Zn&#8208;Cur) features enhanced water solubilities, while copper&#8208;curcumin (Cu&#8208;Cur) shows a higher antioxidant activity but lower solubility than Zn&#8208;Cur. Based on their inherent biological properties, this work proposes a nanomedicine&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange strategy to enhance the efficacy of Cur for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Copper silicate nanoparticles with hollow mesoporous structure were prepared to load water&#8208;soluble Zn&#8208;Cur for constructing a composite nanomedicine, which can degrade in acidic microenvironment of arthritic region, releasing Cu2+ and Zn&#8208;Cur. Cu2+ then substitute for Zn2+ in Zn&#8208;Cur to form Cu&#8208;Cur with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect, capable of efficiently scavenging ROS in M1 macrophages, promoting their transition to an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion&#8208;exchange strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselectivity of C&#8208;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98:2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm = bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8211;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt; 80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8211;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8208;Au(III)&#8208;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Advantages of Defluorinative C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advantages of using C&#8722;F bonds as functional handles for chemical synthesis. Specific examples are used to illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can streamline small molecule synthesis and enable new reactions. The goal of this review is to educate chemists on the opportunities available for incorporating C&#8722;F bonds in synthetic route planning and for exploiting the unique mechanistic pathways available to C&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Much progress has been made in the development of methods to both create compounds that contain C&#8722;F bonds and to functionalize C&#8722;F bonds. As such, C&#8722;F bonds are becoming common and versatile synthetic functional handles. This review summarizes the advantages of defluorinative functionalization reactions for small molecule synthesis. The coverage is organized by the type of carbon framework the fluorine is attached to for mono&#8208; and polyfluorinated motifs. The main challenges, opportunities and advances of defluorinative functionalization are discussed for each class of organofluorine. Most of the text focuses on case studies that illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can improve routes to synthetic targets or how the properties of C&#8722;F bonds enable unique mechanisms and reactions. The broader goal is to showcase the opportunities for incorporating and exploiting C&#8722;F bonds in the design of synthetic routes, improvement of specific reactions and advent of new methods.

         <title>Non&#8208;Doped Blue AIEgen&#8208;Based OLED with EQE Approaching 10.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue AIEgen of DPDPB&#8208;AC was designed by fusing a hot exciton AIEgen of TPB&#8208;AC with a triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) up&#8208;conversion luminogen of DMPPP. When it was used as non&#8208;doped EML of organic light&#8208;emitting diode, an outstanding maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 10.3&#8201;% and an exceptional maximum brightness (Lmax) of 69311&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were achieved.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are attractive for the construction of non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owning to their high emission efficiency in the film state. However, the large internal inversion rate (kIC(Tn)) between high&#8208;lying triplet levels (Tn) and Tn&#8208;1 causes a huge loss of triplet excitons, resulting in dissatisfied device performance of these AIEgens&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Herein, we designed and synthesized a blue luminogen of DPDPB&#8208;AC by fusing an AIEgen of TPB&#8208;AC and a DMPPP, which feature hot exciton and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) up&#8208;conversion process, respectively. DPDPB&#8208;AC successfully inherits the AIE feature and excellent horizontal dipole orientation of TPB&#8208;AC. Furthermore, it owes smaller kIC(Tn) than TPB&#8208;AC. When DPDPB&#8208;AC was applied in OLED as non&#8208;doped emitting layer, an outstanding external quantum efficiency of 10.3&#8201;% and an exceptional brightness of 69311&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were achieved. The transient electroluminescent measurements and steady&#8208;state dynamic analysis confirm that both TTA and hot exciton processes contribute to such excellent device performance. This work provides a new insight into the design of efficient organic fluorophores by managing high&#8208;lying triplet excitons.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Induced Isomerization of Prenucleation Clusters During the Prenucleation Stage of CdTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the prenucleation stage of colloidal semiconductor CdTe quantum dots (QDs), precursor compounds (PCs) of magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) form and isomerize. When the reaction temperature is increased, PC&#8208;371 forms at 25&#8201;&#176;C and isomerizes to PC&#8208;448 at 80&#8201;&#176;C via PC&#8208;417 at 45&#8201;&#176;C. When a prenucleation&#8208;stage sample is placed in a mixture of cyclohexane (CH) and octylamine (OTA), the PCs that have formed transform quickly to their counterpart MSCs.







Abstract
The evolution of prenucleation clusters in the prenucleation stage of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has remained unexplored. With CdTe as a model system, we show that substances form and isomerize prior to the nucleation and growth of QDs. Called precursor compounds (PCs), the prenucleation clusters are relatively optically transparent and can transform to absorbing magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs). When a prenucleation&#8208;stage sample at 25, 45, or 80&#8201;&#176;C is dispersed in a mixture of cyclohexane (CH) and octylamine (OTA) at room temperature, either MSC&#8208;371, MSC&#8208;417, or MSC&#8208;448 evolves with absorption peaking at 371, 417, or 448&#8197;nm, respectively. We propose that PC&#8208;371 forms at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and isomerizes to PC&#8208;417 at 45&#8201;&#176;C and to PC&#8208;448 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The PCs and MSCs are quasi isomers. Relatively large and small amounts of OTA favor PC&#8208;371 and PC&#8208;448 in dispersion, respectively. The present findings suggest the existence of PC&#8208;to&#8208;PC isomerization in the QD prenucleation stage.

The multifunctionality of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based textiles encourages innovation of a wearable platform technology capable of sensing, filtration, detoxification, and catalysis. This Review focuses on the implementation of MOFs at the fiber level to form functional components in smart textiles.







Abstract
Owing to high modularity and synthetic tunability, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on textiles are poised to contribute to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art wearable systems with multifunctional performance. While these composite materials have demonstrated promising functions in sensing, filtration, detoxification, and biomedicine, their applicability in multifunctional systems is only beginning to materialize. This review highlights the multifunctionality and versatility of MOF&#8208;integrated textile systems. It summarizes the operational goals of MOF@textile composites, encompassing sensing, filtration, detoxification, drug delivery, UV protection, and photocatalysis. Building upon these recent advances, this review concludes with an outlook on emerging opportunities for the diverse applications of MOF@textile systems in the realm of smart wearables.

         <title>Engineered Bacteria Labeled with Iridium(III) Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium (III) photosensitizer&#8208;bacteria hybrid (Ir&#8208;HEcN) targets the solid tumors and produces reactive oxygen species in situ upon photoirradiation, which induces pyroptosis of tumor cells and spontaneous self&#8208;elimination of Ir&#8208;HEcN. The resulting debris further evokes innate and adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Therefore, Ir&#8208;HEcN&#8208;mediated treatment remarkably eradicates solid tumors via enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy.







Abstract
Despite metal&#8208;based photosensitizers showing great potential in photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment, the application of the photosensitizers is intrinsically limited by their poor cancer&#8208;targeting properties. Herein, we reported a metal&#8208;based photosensitizer&#8208;bacteria hybrid, Ir&#8208;HEcN, via covalent labeling of an iridium(III) photosensitizer to the surface of genetically engineered bacteria. Due to its intrinsic self&#8208;propelled motility and hypoxia tropism, Ir&#8208;HEcN selectively targets and penetrates deeply into tumor tissues. Importantly, Ir&#8208;HEcN is capable of inducing pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death of tumor cells under irradiation, thereby remarkably evoking anti&#8208;tumor innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo and leading to the regression of solid tumors via combinational photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, Ir&#8208;HEcN is the first metal complex decorated bacteria for enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 with CeO2 Catalyst for Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic coupling of N2 and CO2 to urea was realized on ceria catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies. The reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments.







Abstract
The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) into urea by photocatalytic reaction under mild conditions is considered to be a more environmentally friendly and promising alternative strategies. However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of inert gas on photocatalysts has become the main challenge that hinder the advancement of this technique. Herein, we have successfully established mesoporous CeO2&#8208;x nanorods with adjustable oxygen vacancy concentration by heat treatment in Ar/H2 (90&#8201;%&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;%) atmosphere, enhancing the targeted adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 by introducing oxygen vacancies. Particularly, CeO2&#8208;500 (CeO2 nanorods heated treatment at 500&#8201;&#176;C) revealed high photocatalytic activity toward the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for urea synthesis with a remarkable urea yield rate of 15.5&#8197;&#956;g/h. Besides, both aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy were used to research the atomic surface structure of CeO2&#8208;500 at high resolution and to monitor the key intermediate precursors generated. The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments. We hope this work provides important inspiration and guiding significance towards highly efficient photocatalytic synthesis of urea.

         <title>Utilizing the Hofmeister Effect to Induce Hydrogelation of Nonionic Supramolecular Polymers into a Therapeutic Depot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;ionic supramolecular polymers, formed by self&#8208;assembly of drug&#8208;peptide conjugates, can be induced to undergo a sol&#8208;gel transition using the Hofmeister Effect, in which the well&#8208;hydrated anions disrupt the hydration shell around the supramolecular polymers by polarizing the water molecules closely bound to their surfaces.







Abstract
Nonionic hydrogels are of particular interest for long&#8208;term therapeutic implantation due to their minimal immunogenicity relative to their charged counterparts. However, in situ formation of nonionic supramolecular hydrogels under physiological conditions has been a challenging task. In this context, we report on our discovery of salt&#8208;triggered hydrogelation of nonionic supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by self&#8208;assembling prodrug hydrogelators (SAPHs) through the Hofmeister effect. The designed SAPHs consist of two SN&#8208;38 units, which is an active metabolite of the anticancer drug irinotecan, and a short peptide grafted with two or four oligoethylene glycol (OEG) segments. Upon self&#8208;assembly in water, the resultant nonionic SPs can be triggered to gel upon addition of phosphate salts. Our 1H NMR studies revealed that the added phosphates led to a change in the chemical shift of the methylene protons, suggestive of a disruption of the water&#8208;ether hydrogen bonds and consequent reorganization of the hydration shell surrounding the SPs. This deshielding effect, commensurate with the amount of salt added, likely promoted associative interactions among the SAPH filaments to percolate into a 3D network. The formed hydrogels exhibited a sustained release profile of SN&#8208;38 hydrogelator that acted potently against cancer cells.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of the First Sex&#8208;Inducing Pheromone of a Diatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing sex pheromone was elucidated using metabolomics, labeling experiments, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. The peptide pheromone is active below femtomolar concentrations and synchronizes sexuality in the diatom Seminavis robusta.







Abstract
Diatoms are abundant unicellular microalgae, responsible for &#8776;20&#8201;% of global photosynthetic CO2 fixation. Nevertheless, we know little about fundamental aspects of their biology, such as their sexual reproduction. Pheromone&#8208;mediated chemical communication is crucial for successful mating. An attraction pheromone was identified in the diatom Seminavis robusta, but metabolites priming cells for sex and synchronizing search and mating behavior remained elusive. These sex&#8208;inducing pheromones (SIP) induce cell cycle arrest and trigger the production of the attraction pheromone. Here we describe the challenging structure elucidation of an S. robusta SIP. Guided by metabolomics, a candidate metabolite was identified and elucidated by labeling experiments, NMR, ESI MSn analyses, and chemical transformations. The use of negative ion mode MS was essential to decipher the unprecedented hydroxyproline and &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing cyclic heptapeptide that acts in femtomolar concentrations.

         <title>Engineered Biocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase was engineered for efficient N&#8208;alkylation to access densely functionalized non&#8208;canonical amino acids. Mechanistic analysis guided preparative scale synthesis, adding a valuable new enzyme to the biocatalytic toolbox.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are useful synthons for the development of new medicines, materials, and probes for bioactivity. Recently, enzyme engineering has been leveraged to produce a suite of highly active enzymes for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted amino acids. However, there are few examples of biocatalytic N&#8208;substitution reactions to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino acids. In this study, we used directed evolution to engineer the &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase, TrpB, for improved activity with diverse amine nucleophiles. Mechanistic analysis shows that high yields are hindered by product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle and subsequent decomposition. Additional equivalents of l&#8208;serine can inhibit product reentry through kinetic competition, facilitating preparative scale synthesis. We show &#946;&#8208;substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a gram scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

We show &#946;-substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a gram scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficiencies of Various in situ Polymerizations of Liquid Electrolytes and the Practical Implications for Quasi Solid&#8208;state Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of polymerizations, double bond radical polymerization and ring&#8208;opening polymerization, were investigated under various polymerization conditions. The effects on monomer conversion, Li+&#8208;conductivity and interfacial stability show that the double bond radical polymerization is more suitable for the in situ solidification of electrolytes.







Abstract
In situ polymerization of liquid electrolytes is currently the most feasible way for constructing solid&#8208;state batteries, which, however, is affected by various interfering factors of reactions and so the electrochemical performance of cells. To disclose the effects from polymerization conditions, two types of generally used in situ polymerizing reactions of ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and double bond radical polymerization (DBRP) were investigated on the aspects of monomer conversion and electrochemical properties (Li+&#8208;conductivity and interfacial stability). The ROP generated poly&#8208;ester and poly&#8208;carbonate show a high monomer conversion of &#8776;90&#8201;%, but suffer a poor Li+&#8208;conductivity of lower than 2&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT). Additionally, the terminal alkoxy anion derived from the ROP is not resistant to high&#8208;voltage cathodes. While, the DBRP produced poly&#8208;VEC(vinyl ethylene carbonate) and poly&#8208;VC(vinylene carbonate) show lower monomer conversions of 50&#8211;80&#8201;%, delivering relatively higher Li+&#8208;conductivities of 2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at RT. Compared two polymerizing reactions and four monomers, the VEC&#8208;based F&#8208;containing copolymer possesses advantages in Li+&#8208;conductivity and antioxidant capacity, which also shows simultaneous stability towards Li&#8208;metal with the help of LiF&#8208;based passivating layer, allowing a long&#8208;term stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage quasi solid&#8208;state cells.

         <title>The Power of Kinetic Inertness in Improving Platinum Anticancer Therapy by Circumventing Resistance and Ameliorating Nephrotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically inert platinum organometallic antitumor agent that is remarkably potent in vivo was designed and synthesized. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, the authors demonstrate the power of kinetic inertness in improving the therapeutic benefits of platinum&#8208;based anticancer chemotherapy by overcoming platinum resistance and ameliorating nephrotoxicity.







Abstract
Even in the modern era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, chemotherapy with platinum (Pt) drugs remains among the most commonly prescribed medications against a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, the broad applicability of these blockbuster Pt drugs is severely limited by intrinsic and/or acquired resistance, and high systemic toxicity. Considering the strong interconnection between kinetic lability and undesired shortcomings of clinical Pt drugs, we rationally designed kinetically inert organometallic Pt based anticancer agents with a novel mechanism of action. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that the development of a remarkably efficacious but kinetically inert Pt anticancer agent is feasible. Along with exerting promising antitumor efficacy in Pt&#8208;sensitive as well as Pt&#8208;resistant tumors in vivo, our best candidate has the ability to mitigate the nephrotoxicity issue associated with cisplatin. In addition to demonstrating, for the first time, the power of kinetic inertness in improving the therapeutic benefits of Pt based anticancer therapy, we describe the detailed mechanism of action of our best kinetically inert antitumor agent. This study will certainly pave the way for designing the next generation of anticancer drugs for effective treatment of various cancers.

         <title>Engineered Histidine&#8208;Rich Peptides Enhance Endosomal Escape for Antibody&#8208;Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy has been developed to design and construct endosomal escape peptides. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, peptides with pH&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;perturbation activity have been obtained. These peptides can mediate the endosomal escape of peptide/protein cargoes upon antibody&#8208;targeted delivery, allowing potential applications such as protein delivery and gene editing.







Abstract
Currently, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is mainly limited to the modulation of diseases in extracellular spaces. Intracellular targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal entrapment of internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and construct peptides that enable endosome&#8208;to&#8208;cytosol delivery based on an extension of the &#8220;histidine switch&#8221; principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we obtained peptides with pH&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;perturbation activity. These peptides do not randomly penetrate cells like CPPs, but imitate the endosomal escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16&#8208;residue peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular fusion proteins and achieved antibody&#8208;targeted delivery of diverse protein cargoes&#8212;including the pro&#8208;apoptotic protein BID (BH3&#8208;interacting domain death agonist) and Cre recombinase&#8212;into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab&#8208;hsLMWP&#8208;BID fusion conferred strong anti&#8208;tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, and immunotherapy.

         <title>Gradually Tuning the Flexibility of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks via Stepwise Structural Transformation and Their Flexibility&#8208;Dependent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the combination of linker exchange and linkage conversion strategies, we have achieved the regulation of flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and revealed the impact of different flexibility degree on properties of COFs, including breathing behavior, self&#8208;adaptability, and selective gas sorption.







Abstract
Flexible covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are intriguing for their dynamic properties distinctive from rigid counterparts but still suffer from limited accessibility. Especially, controlling flexibility of COFs is challenging and the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs has rarely been unveiled. This article reports stepwise adjustment on flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional COFs, which is realized by the designed synthesis of rigid COF (R&#8208;COF), semi&#8208;flexible COF (SF&#8208;COF), and flexible COF (F&#8208;COF) through polymerization, linker exchange, and linkage conversion with a newly developed method for reduction of hydrazone, respectively. Significant difference in breathing behavior and self&#8208;adaptive capability of the three COFs are uncovered through vapor response and iodine capture experiments. Gas sorption experiments indicate that the porosity of F&#8208;COF could switch from &#8220;close&#8221; state in nitrogen to &#8220;open&#8221; state in carbon dioxide, which are not observed for R&#8208;COF and SF&#8208;COF. This study not only develops a strategy to adjust the flexibility of COFs by tuning their linkers and linkages, but also provides a deep insight into the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs, which lays a foundation for the development of this new class of dynamic porous materials.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Borylcyclopropanation of Alkenes with a (Diborylmethyl)iodide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, multifunctional (diboronmethyl)iodide reagent (CH(Bpin)2I) was synthesized for the photoinduced cyclopropanation of alkenes, providing an array of 1,2&#8208;substituted cyclopropylboronates. The transformation exhibits operational simplicity, broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and practicality for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.







Abstract
Cyclopropane skeletons play a prominent role in the development of organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a stable, multifunctional (diborylmethyl)iodide reagent (CHI(Bpin)2) for the photoinduced cyclopropanation of alkenes, providing an array of 1,2&#8208;substituted cyclopropylboronates in good yields. This &#945;&#8208;haloboronic ester can be readily synthesized on a multigram scale from commercially available starting materials. Furthermore, the protocol displays high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and allows for late&#8208;stage borylcyclopropanation of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the borylcyclopropanation proceeds through a radical addition/polar cyclization pathway mediated by the photocatalyst fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 and visible light.

         <title>Triplet Generation Through Singlet Fission in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: An Alternative Route to Inefficient Singlet&#8208;Triplet Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet to triplet intersystem crossing can be inhibited in organic chromophore assemblies within crystalline porous MOFs due to a diminished Franck&#8208;Condon overlap between spatially disparate singlet (delocalized) and triplet (localized) wavefunctions. Singlet fission&#8212;occurring through an electron superexchange process&#8212;can be a viable route to achieve high&#8208;yield, low&#8208;energy triplets in framework&#8208;based energy conversion systems.







Abstract
High quantum yield triplets, populated by initially prepared excited singlets, are desired for various energy conversion schemes in solid working compositions like porous MOFs. However, a large disparity in the distribution of the excitonic center of mass, singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) in such assemblies is inhibited, so much so that a carboxy&#8208;coordinated zirconium heavy metal ion cannot effectively facilitate the ISC through spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Circumventing this sluggish ISC, singlet fission (SF) is explored as a viable route to generating triplets in solution&#8208;stable MOFs. Efficient SF is achieved through a high degree of interchromophoric coupling that facilitates electron super&#8208;exchange to generate triplet pairs. Here we show that a predesigned chromophoric linker with extremely poor ISC efficiency (kISC) but 
 form triplets in MOF in contrast to the frameworks that are built from linkers with sizable kISC but 
. This work opens a new photophysical and photochemical avenue in MOF chemistry and utility in energy conversion schemes.

         <title>Binuclear Copper(I) Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared emitting (NIR) compounds based on earth&#8208;abundant binuclear CuI complexes is presented. Two &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions are found in their solid&#8208;state structure yielding doubly locked architectures that help to suppress excited state flattening distortions and quenching. The complexes have been successfully used in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), and unprecedented NIR electroluminescence (EL) with CuI compounds was achieved.







Abstract
Two binuclear heteroleptic CuI complexes, namely Cu&#8722;NIR1 and Cu&#8722;NIR2, bearing rigid chelating diphosphines and &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2,5&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole as the bis&#8208;bidentate ligand are presented. The proposed dinuclearization strategy yields a large bathochromic shift of the emission when compared to the mononuclear counterparts (M1&#8211;M2) and enables shifting luminescence into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region in both solution and solid state, showing emission maximum at ca. 750 and 712&#8197;nm, respectively. The radiative process is assigned to an excited state with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) character as demonstrated by in&#8208;depth photophysical and computational investigation. Noteworthy, X&#8208;ray analysis of the binuclear complexes unravels two interligand &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions yielding a doubly locked structure that disfavours flattening of the tetrahedral coordination around the CuI centre in the excited state and maintain enhanced NIR luminescence. No such interaction is present in M1&#8211;M2. These findings prompt the successful use of Cu&#8722;NIR1 and Cu&#8722;NIR2 in NIR light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), which display electroluminescence maximum up to 756&#8197;nm and peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.43&#8201;%. Their suitability for the fabrication of white&#8208;emitting LECs is also demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of NIR electroluminescent devices based on earth&#8208;abundant CuI emitters.

         <title>A Click Chemistry&#8208;Based Artificial Metallo&#8208;Nuclease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry was used to prepare TC&#8208;Thio, a new artificial metallo&#8208;nuclease. TC&#8208;Thio coordinates up to three CuII ions and is a potent DNA damaging agent that binds and cleaves from the minor groove. Activity was assessed in primary human cells using single molecule imaging of DNA.







Abstract
Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are promising DNA damaging drug candidates. Here, we demonstrate how the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker produced by the Cu&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can be directed to build Cu&#8208;binding AMN scaffolds. We selected biologically inert reaction partners tris(azidomethyl)mesitylene and ethynyl&#8208;thiophene to develop TC&#8208;Thio, a bioactive C3&#8208;symmetric ligand in which three thiophene&#8208;triazole moieties are positioned around a central mesitylene core. The ligand was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and forms multinuclear CuII and CuI complexes identified by mass spectrometry and rationalised by density functional theory (DFT). Upon Cu coordination, CuII&#8208;TC&#8208;Thio becomes a potent DNA binding and cleaving agent. Mechanistic studies reveal DNA recognition occurs exclusively at the minor groove with subsequent oxidative damage promoted through a superoxide&#8208; and peroxide&#8208;dependent pathway. Single molecule imaging of DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells shows that the complex has comparable activity to the clinical drug temozolomide, causing DNA damage that is recognised by a combination of base excision repair (BER) enzymes.

         <title>An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Tackling Conformational Energy Uncertainties in Chiroptical Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical spectroscopies are key to determine the absolute configuration of solvated compounds. Their reliability critically depends on computed Boltzmann factors which are, however, intrinsically inaccurate. Combining a genetic algorithm and a hierarchical clustering analysis enables a major improvement of the analysis of chiroptical spectra and the reliability of the assignment.







Abstract
Determination of the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is a prerequisite for obtaining a fundamental understanding in any chirality&#8208;related field. The interaction with polarised light has proven to be a powerful means to determine this absolute configuration, but its application rests on the comparison between experimental and computed spectra for which the inherent uncertainty in conformational Boltzmann factors has proven to be extremely hard to tackle. Here we present a novel approach that overcomes this issue by combining a genetic algorithm that identifies the relevant conformers by accounting for the uncertainties in DFT relative energies, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm that analyses the trends in the spectra of the considered conformers and identifies on&#8208;the&#8208;fly when a given chiroptical technique is not able to make reliable predictions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by considering the challenging cases of papuamine and haliclonadiamine, two bis&#8208;indane natural products with eight chiral centres and considerable conformational heterogeneity that could not be assigned unambiguously with current approaches.

     alt="An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Tackling Conformational Energy Uncertainties in Chiroptical Spectroscopies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiroptical spectroscopies are key to determine the absolute configuration of solvated compounds. Their reliability critically depends on computed Boltzmann factors which are, however, intrinsically inaccurate. Combining a genetic algorithm and a hierarchical clustering analysis enables a major improvement of the analysis of chiroptical spectra and the reliability of the assignment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determination of the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is a prerequisite for obtaining a fundamental understanding in any chirality-related field. The interaction with polarised light has proven to be a powerful means to determine this absolute configuration, but its application rests on the comparison between experimental and computed spectra for which the inherent uncertainty in conformational Boltzmann factors has proven to be extremely hard to tackle. Here we present a novel approach that overcomes this issue by combining a genetic algorithm that identifies the relevant conformers by accounting for the uncertainties in DFT relative energies, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm that analyses the trends in the spectra of the considered conformers and identifies on-the-fly when a given chiroptical technique is not able to make reliable predictions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by considering the challenging cases of papuamine and haliclonadiamine, two bis-indane natural products with eight chiral centres and considerable conformational heterogeneity that could not be assigned unambiguously with current approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Interlayer Distance and Heteroatom&#8208;Doping of Graphite Provide New Insights into the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Mechanism in Dual&#8208;Carbon Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cost and energy density of dual&#8208;ion batteries pose obstacles to their commercialization as large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. Here we address these issues by proposing a design strategy of graphite materials that involves a large interlayer distance and abundant doping of heteroatoms. This approach enables the realization of high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity dual&#8208;ion batteries as well as dual&#8208;carbon batteries.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, it is still questionable how material structures affect the anion storage behavior. In this paper, we synthesis graphite with an ultra&#8208;large interlayer distance and heteroatomic doping to systematically investigate the combined effects on DIBs. The large interlayer distance of 0.51&#8197;nm provides more space for anion storage, while the doping of the heteroatoms reduces the energy barriers for anion intercalation and migration and enhances rapid ionic storage at interfaces simultaneously. Based on the synergistic effects, the DIBs composed of carbon cathode and lithium anode afford ultra&#8208;high capacity of 240&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Dual&#8208;carbon batteries (DCBs) using the graphite as both of cathode and anode steadily cycle 2400 times at current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Hence, this work provides a reference to the strategy of material designs of DIBs and DCBs.

         <title>Atomization&#8208;Induced High Intrinsic Activity of a Biocompatible MgAl&#8208;LDH Supported Ru Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Efficient Radicals Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) supported Ru single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ru1/LDH SAE) was developed to mimic multi&#8208;enzymes. Ru1/LDH SAE shows high intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity, which outperforms the Ru nanoclusters nanozyme by a factor of 20 and surpasses most SAEs reported so far.







Abstract
Developing efficient nanozymes to mimic natural enzymes for scavenging reactive radicals remains a significant challenge owing to the insufficient activity of conventional nanozymes. Herein, we report a novel Ru single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAE), featuring atomically dispersed Ru atoms on a biocompatible MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Ru1/LDH). The prepared Ru1/LDH SAE shows high intrinsic peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, which outperforms the Ru nanoclusters (NCs) nanozyme by a factor of 20 and surpasses most SAEs. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the high intrinsic POD&#8208;like activity of Ru1/LDH can be attributed to a heterolytic path of H2O2 dissociation on the single Ru sites, which requires lower free energy (0.43&#8197;eV) compared to the homolytic path dissociation on Ru NC (0.63&#8197;eV). In addition, the Ru1/LDH SAE shows excellent multiple free radicals scavenging ability, including superoxide anion radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH), nitric oxide radical (NO&#8901;) and 2, 2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH&#8901;). Given the advantages of Ru1/LDH with high enzymatic activities, biosafety, and ease to scale up, it paves the way for exploring SAEs in the practical biological immunity system.

         <title>Introducing Bidirectional Axial Coordination into BiVO4@Metal Phthalocyanine Core&#8211;Shell Photoanodes for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazine was adopted as axial coordination agent for the first time to construct core&#8211;shell BiVO4@metal polyphthalocyanine photoanode. The axial coordination of pyrazine facilitated the carrier transfer across the BiVO4 and metal phthalocyanine interface and endowed ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine with lower Fe d band center and orbital spin, which improved the OER activity by promoting the *OOH desorption.







Abstract
Core&#8208;shell photoanodes have shown great potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, the construction of a high&#8208;quality interface between the core and shell, as well as a highly catalytic surface, remains a challenge. Herein, guided by computation, we present a BiVO4 photoanode coated with ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine using pyrazine as a coordination agent. The bidirectional axial coordination of pyrazine plays a dual role by facilitating intimate interfacial contact between BiVO4 and ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine, as well as regulating the electron density and spin configuration of metal sites in ZnCoFe phthalocyanine, thereby promoting the potential&#8208;limiting step of *OOH desorption. The resulting photoanode displayed a high photocurrent density of 5.7&#177;0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE. This study introduces a new approach for constructing core&#8211;shell photoanodes, and uncovers the key role of pyrazine axial coordination in modulating the catalytic activity of metal phthalocyanine.

         <title>A Rapid Sputum&#8208;based Lateral Flow Assay for Airway Eosinophilia using an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme Selected for Eosinophil Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive and specific lateral flow assay for eosinophil peroxidase using a new protein&#8208;activated RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme can detect the protein in patient sputum with a total assay time of 40&#8197;min to diagnose eosinophilic airway disease.







Abstract
The first protein&#8208;binding allosteric RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme (RCD) obtained by direct in vitro selection against eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), a validated marker for airway eosinophilia, is described. The RCD has nanomolar affinity for EPX, shows high selectivity against related peroxidases and other eosinophil proteins, and is resistant to degradation by mammalian nucleases. An optimized RCD was used to develop both fluorescence and lateral flow assays, which were evaluated using 38&#8197;minimally processed patient sputum samples (23&#8197;non&#8208;eosinophilic, 15&#8197;eosinophilic), producing a clinical sensitivity of 100&#8201;% and specificity of 96&#8201;%. This RCD&#8208;based lateral flow assay should allow for rapid evaluation of airway eosinophilia as an aid for guiding asthma therapy.

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Reactivity of Borocarbonitride in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suitable amount of carbon in h&#8208;BN catalyst effectively inhibits the excessive oxidation of BCN in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Density functional theory calculations show that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can affect the electronic microenvironment of h&#8208;BN to render a superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Borocarbonitride (BCN) materials are newly developed oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes. However, BCN materials tend to form bulky B2O3 due to over&#8208;oxidation at the high reaction temperature, resulting in significant deactivation. Here, we report a series of super stable BCN nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance of the BCN nanosheets can be easily regulated by changing the guanine dosage. The control experiment and structural characterization indicate that the introduction of a suitable amount of carbon could prevent the formation of excessive B2O3 from BCN materials and maintain the 2D skeleton at a high temperature of 520&#8201;&#176;C. The best&#8208;performing catalyst BCN exhibits 81.9&#8201;% selectivity towards olefins with a stable propane conversion of 35.8&#8201;%, and the propene productivity reaches 16.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much better than hexagonal BN (h&#8208;BN) catalysts. Density functional theory calculation results show that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can significantly affect the electronic microenvironment of h&#8208;BN, thereby boosting the catalytic activity of BCN.

         <title>Two&#8208;Way Catalysis in a Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction Limits Inhibition Induced by an External Electric Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented external electric field (EEF) catalyzes Diels&#8211;Alder reactions in one direction and inhibits them in the other. The inhibitory direction becomes rate&#8208;enhancing with increasing EEF. The EEF strength necessary to bring maximum inhibition is defined as the Electrostatic Resistance Point (ERP). ERP values gauge electrostatic interactions between substituents and external electrostatic stimuli.







Abstract
Oriented external electric fields (EEFs) act as catalysts that can induce selectivity in chemical reactions. The responses of the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and ethylene (BDE&#8208;DA) as well as cyclopentadiene and ethylene (CPDE&#8208;DA) towards EEF stimuli are investigated here using density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations. EEF is a vector that catalyzes the reaction in one direction while inhibiting it in the opposite direction. Here we report that the inhibitive direction becomes rate&#8208;enhancing after some increase in the EEF. The EEF value that brings about the maximum possible inhibition for the reaction is defined as the electrostatic resistance point (ERP). The possibility of both normal and inverse electron&#8208;demand DA reactions causes catalytic activity in both directions of the EEF starting at a unique ERP value. The C5 substituents of cyclopentadiene control the ERP values depending upon the resistance power that the functional group provides against the EEF. The endo and exo diastereomeric transition states of the DA reaction have distinct ERP values and the difference (&#916;ERP) provides the through&#8208;space electrostatic contribution to the stereoselectivity on a relative scale. Thus, the ERP values can be used as a gauge for the electrostatic interactions between substituent groups and external stimuli.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymers Based on Simple Electron&#8208;Deficient Cyanated trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;Butadienes for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

Sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene has led to a series of structurally simple but highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks for semiconducting polymers having unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with electron mobilities of &gt;1&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. The study offers inspiration for developing structurally simple electron&#8208;deficient units for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance but low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers remains a significant challenge in the commercialization of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). To achieve this objective, it is essential to design the key electron&#8208;deficient units with simple structures and facile preparation processes, which can facilitate the production of low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers. Herein, by sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene, we developed a series of structurally simple but highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadiene (CNDE), 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadiene (CNFDE), and 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadiene (CNDFDE), featuring a highly coplanar backbone and deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (&#8722;3.03&#8211;4.33&#8197;eV), which render them highly attractive for developing n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. Notably, all these electron&#8208;deficient units can be easily accessed by a two&#8208;step high&#8208;yield synthetic procedure from low&#8208;cost raw materials, thus rendering them highly promising candidates for commercial applications. Upon polymerization with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), three copolymers were developed that demonstrated unipolar n&#8208;type transport characteristics in OFETs with the highest electron mobility of &gt;1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Hence, CNDE, CNFDE, and CNDFDE represent a class of novel, simple, and efficient electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers, thereby providing valuable insight for OFET applications.

Ionic crosslinking is introduced into high&#8208;cationic&#8208;ratio AEMs to suppress high water uptake and swelling while further improving the hydroxide conductivity. This strategy limited the dimensional change and water uptake of the AEMs, with a high hydroxide conductivity observed. The chemical design used in this study presents a significant advancement toward developing AEMs showing high conductivity and stability simultaneously for fuel cell applications.







Abstract
The lack of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) that possess both high hydroxide conductivity and stable mechanical and chemical properties poses a major challenge to the development of high&#8208;performance fuel cells. Improving one side of the balance between conductivity and stability usually means sacrificing the other. Herein, we used facile, high&#8208;yield chemical reactions to design and synthesize a piperidinium polymer with a polyethylene backbone for AEM fuel cell applications. To improve the performance, we introduced ionic crosslinking into high&#8208;cationic&#8208;ratio AEMs to suppress high water uptake and swelling while further improving the hydroxide conductivity. Remarkably, PEP80&#8208;20PS achieved a hydroxide conductivity of 354.3&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C while remaining mechanically stable. Compared with the base polymer PEP80, the water uptake of PEP80&#8208;20PS decreased by 69&#8201;% from 813&#8201;% to 350&#8201;%, and the swelling decreased substantially by 85&#8201;% from 350.0&#8201;% to 50.2&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C. PEP80&#8208;20PS also showed excellent alkaline stability, 84.7&#8201;% remained after 35&#8197;days of treatment with an aqueous KOH solution. The chemical design in this study represents a significant advancement toward the development of simultaneously highly stable and conductive AEMs for fuel cell applications.

         <title>Lithium Promotes Acetylide Formation on MgO During Methane Coupling Under Non&#8208;Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>

Li doping of MgO critically improves selectivity toward C2&#8208;products in non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane. The presence of Li favors the formation of magnesium acetylide and therefore is likely involved in C2 formation.







Abstract
A prototypical material for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is Li/MgO, for which Li is known to be essential as a dopant to obtain high C2 selectivities. Herein, Li/MgO is demonstrated to be an effective catalyst for non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM). Moreover, the presence of Li is shown to favor the formation of magnesium acetylide (MgC2), while pure MgO promotes coke formation as evidenced by solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR, thus indicating that Li promotes C&#8722;C bond formation. Metadynamic simulations of the carbon mobility in MgC2 and Li2C2 at the density functional theory (DFT) level show that carbon easily diffuses as a C2 unit at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. These insights suggest that the enhanced C2 selectivity for Li&#8208;doped MgO is related to the formation of Li and Mg acetylides.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Communication Along a Scaffolded Nanoscale Array of Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two nanometer&#8208;long molecular device has been synthesised that contains a rigid rod &#8208; to provide structural definition &#8208; attached to a molecular relay that switches direction in response to an incoming signal. Like natural systems, it responds to temporal changes in a signal, exemplified by the consumption of a molecular fuel, changes that are transmitted down the device.







Abstract
Relaying conformational change over several nanometers is central to the function of allosterically regulated proteins. Replicating this mechanism artificially would provide important communication tools, but requires nanometer&#8208;sized molecules that reversibly switch between defined shapes in response to signaling molecules. In this work, 1.8&#8197;nm long rigid rod oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)s are scaffolds for switchable multi&#8208;squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bond relays. Each relay can adopt either a parallel or an antiparallel orientation relative to the scaffold; the preferred orientation is dictated by a director group at one end. An amine director responded to proton signals, with acid&#8208;base cycles producing multiple reversible changes in relay orientation that were reported by a terminal NH, which is 1.8&#8197;nm distant. Moreover, a chemical fuel acted as a dissipative signal. As the fuel was consumed, the relay reverted to its original orientation, illustrating how information from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium molecular signals can be communicated to a distant site.

         <title>Terminally Chlorinated and Thiophene&#8208;linked Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structured 3D Acceptors with Versatile Processability for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of terminally chlorinated and thiophene&#8208;linked three&#8208;dimensional (3D) dimerized acceptors were reported to explore the effect of chlorination by precisely tuning the position and number of chlorine atoms. The decent performance of PM6:CH8&#8208;4 on small&#8208;area devices, non&#8208;halogen solvent and air&#8208;processed devices, and 2.88&#8197;cm2 solar cell modules highlights the versatile processing capability of our 3D acceptors.







Abstract
To exploit the potential of our newly developed three&#8208;dimensional (3D) dimerized acceptors, a series of chlorinated 3D acceptors (namely CH8&#8208;3/4/5) were reported by precisely tuning the position of chlorine (Cl) atom. The introduction of Cl atom in central unit affects the molecular conformation. Whereas, by replacing fluorinated terminal groups (CH8&#8208;3) with chlorinated terminal groups (CH8&#8208;4 and CH8&#8208;5), the red&#8208;shift absorption and enhanced crystallization are achieved. Benefiting from these, all devices received promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16&#8201;% as well as decent thermal/photo&#8208;stabilities. Among them, PM6:CH8&#8208;4 based device yielded a best PCE of 17.58&#8201;%. Besides, the 3D merits with multi alkyl chains enable their versatile processability during the device preparation. Impressive PCEs of 17.27&#8201;% and 16.23&#8201;% could be achieved for non&#8208;halogen solvent processable devices prepared in glovebox and ambient, respectively. 2.88&#8197;cm2 modules also obtained PCEs over 13&#8201;% via spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods, respectively. These results are among the best performance of dimerized acceptors. The decent performance of CH8&#8208;4 on small&#8208;area devices, modules and non&#8208;halogen solvent&#8208;processed devices highlights the versatile processing capability of our 3D acceptors, as well as their potential applications in the future.

         <title>Discovering Dynamic Plant Enzyme Complexes in Yeast for Kratom Alkaloid Pathway Identification
</title>

Yeast&#8208;based protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) screening identified dynamic enzyme complexes and biosynthetic pathways they organize from a rare plant, kratom. PPI screening identified four functional medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenases (MsMDRs) interacting with strictosidine &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosidase (MsSGD), leading to four novel pathway branches. This study highlights how leveraging post&#8208;translational regulation features can accelerate the discovery of biosynthetic pathways in plants.







Abstract
Discovering natural product biosynthetic pathways of medicinal plants is challenging and laborious. Capturing the coregulation patterns of pathway enzymes, particularly transcriptomic regulation, has proven an effective method to accelerate pathway identification. In this study, we developed a yeast&#8208;based screening method to capture the protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) between plant enzymes, which is another useful pattern to complement the prevalent approach. Combining this method with plant multiomics analysis, we discovered four enzyme complexes and their organized pathways from kratom, an alkaloid&#8208;producing plant. The four pathway branches involved six enzymes, including a strictosidine synthase, a strictosidine &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosidase (MsSGD), and four medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductases (MsMDRs). PPI screening selected six MsMDRs interacting with MsSGD from 20&#8197;candidates predicted by multiomics analysis. Four of the six MsMDRs were then characterized as functional, indicating the high selectivity of the PPI screening method. This study highlights the opportunity of leveraging post&#8208;translational regulation features to discover novel plant natural product biosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Turning on Asymmetric Catalysis of Achiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks by Imparting Chiral Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral microenvironment around catalytically active metal clusters in a MOF, PCN&#8208;222(Cu), is created by simply grafting chiral molecules (R)&#8722;Cn&#8722;COOH (n=1, 2, 3). Owing to multi&#8208;level modulation such as hydrogen interaction, steric hindrance, and confinement effect caused by the microenvironment, the resulting (R)&#8722;Cn@PCN&#8208;222(Cu) exhibits high activity and enantioselectivity in the asymmetric ring&#8208;opening of cyclohexene oxide with aniline.







Abstract
The development of heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts has attracted increasing interest in synthetic chemistry but mostly relies on the immobilization of homogeneous chiral catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The chiral microenvironment around catalytically active metal clusters in a MOF, PCN-222(Cu), is created by simply grafting chiral molecules (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;COOH (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1, 2, 3). Owing to multi-level modulation such as hydrogen interaction, steric hindrance, and confinement effect caused by the microenvironment, the resulting (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN-222(Cu) exhibits high activity and enantioselectivity in the asymmetric ring-opening of cyclohexene oxide with aniline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts has attracted increasing interest in synthetic chemistry but mostly relies on the immobilization of homogeneous chiral catalysts. Herein, a series of chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been fabricated by anchoring similar chiral hydroxylated molecules (catalytically inactive) with different lengths onto Zr-oxo clusters in achiral PCN-222(Cu). The resulting chiral MOFs exhibit regulated enantioselectivity up to 83&#8201;%&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; in the asymmetric ring-opening of cyclohexene oxide. The chiral molecules furnished onto the catalytic Lewis sites in the MOF create multilevel microenvironment, including the hydrogen interaction between the substrate and the chiral &#8722;OH group, the steric hindrance endowed by the benzene ring on the chiral molecules, and the proximity between the catalytic sites and chiral molecules confined in the MOF pores, which play crucial roles and synergistically promote chiral catalysis.

         <title>A TriPPPro&#8208;Nucleotide Reporter with Optimized Cell&#8208;Permeable Dyes for Metabolic Labeling of Cellular and Viral DNA in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TriPPPro approach facilitates live&#8208;cell imaging of metabolically labeled cellular and viral DNA. The pronucleotide of a modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate allows the incorporation of the fast bioorthogonal 2TCOa label belonging to the iEDDA repertoire. Subsequent staining of the tagged DNA with highly reactive dye&#8208;tetrazine conjugates within minutes to hours after dye addition enables the visualization of nucleic acids in real time.







Abstract
The metabolic labeling of nucleic acids in living cells is highly desirable to track the dynamics of nucleic acid metabolism in real&#8208;time and has the potential to provide novel insights into cellular biology as well as pathogen&#8208;host interactions. Catalyst&#8208;free inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions (iEDDA) with nucleosides carrying highly reactive moieties such as axial 2&#8208;trans&#8208;cyclooctene (2TCOa) would be an ideal tool to allow intracellular labeling of DNA. However, cellular kinase phosphorylation of the modified nucleosides is needed after cellular uptake as triphosphates are not membrane permeable. Unfortunately, the narrow substrate window of most endogenous kinases limits the use of highly reactive moieties. Here, we apply our TriPPPro (triphosphate pronucleotide) approach to directly deliver a highly reactive 2TCOa&#8208;modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate reporter into living cells. We show that this nucleoside triphosphate is metabolically incorporated into de novo synthesized cellular and viral DNA and can be labeled with highly reactive and cell&#8208;permeable fluorescent dye&#8208;tetrazine conjugates via iEDDA to visualize DNA in living cells directly. Thus, we present the first comprehensive method for live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular and viral nucleic acids using a two&#8208;step labeling approach.

         <title>Anion&#8208;tethered Single Lithium&#8208;ion Conducting Polyelectrolytes through UV&#8208;induced Free Radical Polymerization for Improved Morphological Stability of Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion transport kinetics, Li0 deposition behavior, and electrochemical performances of a dual&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte and a single&#8208;ion conducting polyelectrolyte (SIC) were investigated. The SIC electrolyte showed improved Li+ transference number (0.85), uniform Li0 morphology, enhanced critical current density (2.4&#8197;mA/cm2), and durability of 4500 cycles in Li0&#8208;LiFePO4 battery.







Abstract
Single Li+ ion conducting polyelectrolytes (SICs), which feature covalently tethered counter&#8208;anions along their backbone, have the potential to mitigate dendrite formation by reducing concentration polarization and preventing salt depletion. However, due to their low ionic conductivity and complicated synthetic procedure, the successful validation of these claimed advantages in lithium metal (Li0) anode batteries remains limited. In this study, we fabricated a SIC electrolyte using a single&#8208;step UV polymerization approach. The resulting electrolyte exhibited a high Li+ transference number (t+) of 0.85 and demonstrated good Li+ conductivity (6.3&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S/cm at room temperature), which is comparable to that of a benchmark dual ion conductor (DIC, 9.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S/cm). Benefitting from the high transference number of SIC, it displayed a three&#8208;fold higher critical current density (2.4&#8197;mA/cm2) compared to DIC (0.8&#8197;mA/cm2) by successfully suppressing concentration polarization&#8208;induced short&#8208;circuiting. Additionally, the t+ significantly influenced the deposition behavior of Li0, with SIC yielding a uniform, compact, and mosaic&#8208;like morphology, while the low t+ DIC resulted in a porous morphology with Li0 whiskers. Using the SIC electrolyte, Li0||LiFePO4 cells exhibited stable operation for 4500 cycles with 70.5&#8201;% capacity retention at 22&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Rich Supramolecular Nano&#8208;Container Crosslinked Hydrogel for Lithium Extraction with Super&#8208;High Capacity and Extreme Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust fluorine&#8208;containing hydrogel was made by incorporating supramolecular nanosheets from fluorinated monomers in a one&#8208;pot polymerization. It shows a high lithium adsorption capacity (Qm Li+=122.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and selectivity for Li+. Separation of Li+/Na+ in actual wastewater is achieved with a separation factor of 153.72. The recovery capability and Li+ selectivity are associated with specific coordination between lithium and fluorine.







Abstract
Extraction and recovery of lithium from reserves play a critical role in the sustainable development of energy due to the explosive growth of the lithium&#8208;battery market. However, the low efficiency of extraction and recovery seriously threatens the sustainability of lithium supply. In this contribution, we fabricate a novel mechanically robust fluorine&#8208;rich hydrogel, showing highly efficient Li+ extraction from Li&#8208;containing solutions. The hydrogel was facilely fabricated by simple one&#8208;pot polymerization of supramolecular nanosheets of fluorinated monomers, acrylic acid and a small amount of chemical crosslinkers. The hydrogel exhibits a remarkable lithium adsorption capacity (Qm Li+=122.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and can be reused. Moreover, it can exclusively extract lithium ions from multiple co&#8208;existing metal ions. Notably, the separation of Li+/Na+ in actual wastewater is achieved with a surprising separation factor of 153.72. The detailed characterizations as well as calculation showed that the specific coordination of Li&#8722;F plays a central role for both of the striking recovery capability and selectivity for Li+. Furthermore, an artificial device was constructed, displaying high efficiency of extracting lithium in various complex actual lithium&#8208;containing wastewater. This work provides a new and promising avenue for the efficient extraction and recovery of lithium resource from complex lithium&#8208;containing solutions.

         <title>Low Ruthenium Content Confined on Boron Carbon Nitride as an Efficient and Stable Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru nanoparticles immobilized on a stable boron carbon nitride (BCN) nanosheet support show excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability. The coordination of introduced B and active N sites in BCN provides strong interaction between the Ru and the support, which facilitates Ru dispersity and promotes the catalyst's stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the BCN support can reduce the OER energy barrier and change the adsorption capacity for intermediate products.







Abstract
To date, only a few noble metal oxides exhibit the required efficiency and stability as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under the acidic, high&#8208;voltage conditions that exist during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). The high cost and scarcity of these catalysts hinder the large&#8208;scale application of PEMWE. Here, we report a novel OER electrocatalyst for OER comprised of uniformly dispersed Ru clusters confined on boron carbon nitride (BCN) support. Compared to RuO2, our BCN&#8208;supported catalyst shows enhanced charge transfer. It displays a low overpotential of 164&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, suggesting its excellent OER catalytic activity. This catalyst was able to operate continuously for over 12&#8197;h under acidic conditions, whereas RuO2 without any support fails in 1&#8197;h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the interaction between the N on BCN support and Ru clusters changes the adsorption capacity and reduces the OER energy barrier, which increases the electrocatalytic activity of Ru.

&lt;p&gt;Ru nanoparticles immobilized on a stable boron carbon nitride (BCN) nanosheet support show excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability. The coordination of introduced B and active N sites in BCN provides strong interaction between the Ru and the support, which facilitates Ru dispersity and promotes the catalyst's stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the BCN support can reduce the OER energy barrier and change the adsorption capacity for intermediate products.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Modulating Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coupling in Anti&#8208;Perovskite Nitride via Cation Doping for Efficient Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the metal&#8208;nitrogen coupling in anti&#8208;perovskite Co4N can be effective modulated by Cu doping, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation process during electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia.







Abstract
The complexes of metal center and nitrogen ligands are the most representative systems for catalyzing hydrogenation reactions in small molecule conversion. Developing heterogeneous catalysts with similar active metal&#8208;nitrogen functional centers, nevertheless, still remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that the metal&#8208;nitrogen coupling in anti&#8208;perovskite Co4N can be effective modulated by Cu doping to form Co3CuN, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation process during electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia. The combination of advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that Cu dopants strengthen the Co&#8722;N bond and upshifted the metal d&#8208;band towards the Fermi level, promoting the adsorption of NO3&#8722; and *H and facilitating the transition from *NO2/*NO to *NO2H/*NOH. Consequently, the Co3CuN delivers noticeably better NO3&#8722;RR activity than the pristine Co4N, with optimal Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and ammonia yield of 455.3&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance heterogeneous catalyst for electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Crystal Monomer to Single&#8208;Crystal Polymer Reaction Activated by a Triplet Excimer in a Zipper Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel understanding of the topochemical polymerization of bisindenedione in a single crystal has been proposed. The mechanism involves the formation of a triplet excimer, which evolves into a bonded triplet state, followed by propagation and termination.







Abstract
A combined experimental and theoretical study focused on the elucidation of the polymerization mechanism of the crystal monomer to crystal polymer reaction of a bisindenedione compound in the solid state. The experimental description and characterization of the polymer product have been reported elsewhere and, in this article, we address the first detailed description of the polymerization process. This reaction pathway consists of the initial formation of a triplet excimer state that relaxes to an intermolecularly bonded triplet state that is the starting point of the propagation step of the polymerization. The overall process can be visualized in the monomer starting state as an open zipper in which a cursor or slider is formed by light absorption and the whole zipper is then closed by propagation of the cursor. To this end, variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (ESR), femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and vibrational Raman spectroscopic data have been implemented in combination with quantum chemical calculations. The presented mechanistic insight is of great value to understand the intricacies of such an important reaction and to envisage and diversify the products produced thereof.

         <title>High Throughput Multidimensional Kinetic Screening in Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated high throughput platform is developed to screen polymerizations in multidimensions under well controlled and reproducible conditions. Via combining flow chemistry, machine automation and inline analysis, kinetic data libraries with very good accuracy (absolute error &lt;4&#8201;%) were built with a large amount of data generated from the platform.







Abstract
An automated high throughput multidimensional reaction screening platform based on an inline Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy is presented. By combining flow chemistry, machine automation and inline analysis, the platform is able to screen reactions in multidimensions (residence time, monomer concentration, degree of polymerization, reaction temperature and monomer conversion) rapidly and efficiently way. Kinetic data libraries associated with high data precision (absolute error &lt;4&#8201;%), high reproducibility and high data density are built with ease from the platform. To test the method, we screened the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of methyl acrylate in unmatched detail, and the ring opening metathesis polymerization of methyl&#8208;5&#8208;norbornene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate. The method we introduce is a key step in providing &#8220;big data&#8221; for data driven research in the future, and already at present allows for precise prediction of reaction outcomes within the high&#8208;dimensional chemical parameter space that is screened.

         <title>Using Aggregation to Chaperone Nanoparticles Across Fluid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capitalizing on the aggregation of NPs induces an unusual &#8220;single particle&#8208;aggregation&#8208;single particle&#8221; transfer process, which can be established through either ligand&#8208;exchange processes or electrostatic interactions. By introducing a jammed NP&#8208;polymer assembled layer at the liquid/liquid interface (LLI), the transfer process can be suppressed, opening a new strategy to manipulate the dispersion of nanoparticles in various liquid media.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) transfer is usually induced by adding ligands to modify NP surfaces, but aggregation of NPs oftentimes hampers the transfer. Here, we show that aggregation during NP phase transfer does not necessarily result in transfer failure. Using a model system comprising gold NPs and amphiphilic polymers, we demonstrate an unusual mechanism by which NPs can undergo phase transfer from the aqueous phase to the organic phase via a single&#8208;aggregation&#8208;single pathway. Our discovery challenges the conventional idea that aggregation inhibits NP transfer and provides an unexpected pathway for transferring larger&#8208;sized NPs (&gt;20&#8197;nm). The charged amphiphilic polymers effectively act as chaperons for the NP transfer and offer a unique way to manipulate the dispersion and distribution of NPs in two immiscible liquids. Moreover, by intentionally jamming the NP&#8208;polymer assembly at the liquid/liquid interface, the transfer process can be inhibited.

         <title>Integrated Photochromic&#8208;Photothermal Processes for Catalytic Plastic Upcycling</title>

We surpass the limitation of the existing photothermal catalysis mechanism and propose a photochromic&#8208;photothermal catalytic system based on polyol&#8208;ligated TiO2 nanocrystals. Upon sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. This process boosts photothermal efficiency and facilitates polyester glycolysis efficiency.







Abstract
Incorporating high&#8208;energy ultraviolet (UV) photons into photothermal catalytic processes may enable photothermal&#8208;photochemical synergistic catalysis, which represents a transformative technology for waste plastic recycling. The major challenge is avoiding side reactions and by&#8208;products caused by these energetic photons. Here, we break through the limitation of the existing photothermal conversion mechanism and propose a photochromic&#8208;photothermal catalytic system based on polyol&#8208;ligated TiO2 nanocrystals. Upon UV or sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols can rapidly capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. The resulting abundant defect energy levels boost sunlight&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, and simultaneously the oxygen vacancies facilitate polyester glycolysis by activating the nucleophilic addition&#8208;elimination process. As a result, compared to commercial TiO2 (P25), we achieve 6&#8208;fold and 12.2&#8208;fold performance enhancements under thermal and photothermal conditions, respectively, while maintaining high selectivity to high&#8208;valued monomers. This paradigm&#8208;shift strategy directs energetic UV photons for activating catalysts and avoids their interaction with reactants, opening the possibility of substantially elevating the efficiency of more solar&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>Accelerated Microbial Corrosion by Magnetite and Electrically Conductive Pili through Direct Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;Microbe Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrically conductive pili (e&#8208;pili) and magnetite facilitate Geobacter sulfurreducens electron uptake from metallic iron. The complex interactions between e&#8208;pili, cytochromes, and magnetite are actively researched in electrobiocorrosion. Magnetite, a common corrosion product, enhances electrobiocorrosion through a positive feedback loop. It reduces the need for cells to create electrical contacts, leading to high corrosion rate.







Abstract
Electrobiocorrosion, the process in which microbes extract electrons from metallic iron (Fe0) through direct Fe0&#8208;microbe electrical connections, is thought to contribute to the costly corrosion of iron&#8208;containing metals that impacts many industries. However, electrobiocorrosion mechanisms are poorly understood. We report here that electrically conductive pili (e&#8208;pili) and the conductive mineral magnetite play an important role in the electron transfer between Fe0 and Geobacter sulfurreducens, the first microbe in which electrobiocorrosion has been rigorously documented. Genetic modification to express poorly conductive pili substantially diminished corrosive pitting and rates of Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;microbe electron flux. Magnetite reduced resistance to electron transfer, increasing corrosion currents and intensifying pitting. Studies with mutants suggested that the magnetite promoted electron transfer in a manner similar to the outer&#8208;surface c&#8208;type cytochrome OmcS. These findings, and the fact that magnetite is a common product of iron corrosion, suggest a potential positive feedback loop of magnetite produced during corrosion further accelerating electrobiocorrosion. The interactions of e&#8208;pili, cytochromes, and magnetite demonstrate mechanistic complexities of electrobiocorrosion, but also provide insights into detecting and possibly mitigating this economically damaging process.

         <title>A Radical Pathway and Stabilized Li Anode Enabled by Halide Quaternary Ammonium Electrolyte Additives for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetrapropylammonium bromide (T3Br) additive in a Li&#8722;S electrolyte can trigger the S3.&#8722; radical pathway, which not only enhances the sulfur redox kinetics but also results in a 3D Li2S nucleation. In addition, the T3Br additive weakens the solvation structure of Li+ and creates a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface on Li anode.







Abstract
Passivation of the sulfur cathode by insulating lithium sulfide restricts the reversibility and sulfur utilization of Li&#8722;S batteries. 3D nucleation of Li2S enabled by radical conversion may significantly boost the redox kinetics. Electrolytes with high donor number (DN) solvents allow for tri&#8208;sulfur (S3&#8901;&#8722;) radicals as intermediates, however, the catastrophic reactivity of such solvents with Li anodes pose a great challenge for their practical application. Here, we propose the use of quaternary ammonium salts as electrolyte additives, which can preserve the partial high&#8208;DN characteristics that trigger the S3&#8901;&#8722; radical pathway, and inhibit the growth of Li dendrites. Li&#8722;S batteries with tetrapropylammonium bromide (T3Br) electrolyte additive deliver the outstanding cycling stability (700 cycles at 1&#8197;C with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049&#8201;% per cycle), and high capacity under a lean electrolyte of 5&#8197;&#956;Lelectrolyte&#8201;mgsulfur&#8722;1. This work opens a new avenue for the development of electrolyte additives for Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Mild Synthesis of Polychlorinated Arenes for Efficient Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with Dual Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and direct method has been developed to synthesize polychlorinated heteroatom polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through an intermediate electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex. The developed polychlorinated emitter could act as a dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diode as a result of the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of the chlorine atoms.







Abstract
Polychlorinated (hetero)arenes have shown great promise for organic optoelectronics applications. However, the harsh synthetic routes for polychlorinated compounds and the possible luminescence quenching from the compact intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking induced by chlorine atoms limit their investigations and applications in luminescent materials. Herein, two isomeric polychlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds JY&#8208;1&#8208;Cl and JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl consisting of rigidified aryl ketones and amine are designed and synthesized under mild conditions through nucleophilic chlorination intermediated by an electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex. Among them, as a result of the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induced by chlorine atoms, JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl exhibits bright monomer and dimer emissions with dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characters. Notably, compared with the non&#8208;chlorinated compounds, a high photoluminescence quantum yield is maintained after introducing multiple chlorine atoms into JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl. The first dual&#8208;TADF organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are also successfully fabricated with maximum external quantum efficiency as high as 29.1&#8201;% by employing JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl as emitter. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of polychlorinated amine&#8208;carbonyl PAHs and demonstrates the great potential of the chlorinated materials for luminescent applications.

         <title>Stereodivergent Zweifel Olefination and its Mechanistic Dichotomy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanistic dichotomy in Zweifel olefination using boronate complexes carrying two different reactive &#960;&#8208;systems is explored herein. The synthesis of vinyl heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes with up to 100&#8201;% stereoselectivity is demonstrated. A DFT calculations study allowed to highlight the mechanistic dichotomy in the stereoselective formation of E vs. Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes using different heteroarenes.







Abstract
Stereoselective Zweifel olefination using boronate complexes carrying two different reactive &#960;&#8208;systems was achieved to synthesize vinyl heteroarenes and conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes in good yield and up to 100&#8201;% stereoselectivity, which remains unexplored until now. Most importantly, we report the unprecedented formation of E vs. Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes for different heteroarenes under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) investigations unveil the mechanistic dichotomy between olefin and heteroarene activation followed by 1,2&#8208;migration, leading to E or Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes respectively. We also report a previously unknown reversal of stereoselectivity by using 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) as an electrophile. The Zweifel olefination using a boronate complex that carries two different olefins was previously unexplored due to significant challenges associated with the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins. We have solved this problem and reported the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Dinor[7]helicene and Beyond: Divergent Synthesis of Chiral Diradicaloids with Variable Open&#8208;Shell Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One starting material, two ring&#8208;forming steps, and three fusion patterns. A sequence of electrophilic cyclizations enables the first synthesis of dinor[7]helicene, a configurationally stable, redox&#8208;active diradicaloid analogue of [7]helicene. Strain&#8208;induced rearrangements of larger aromatic precursors provide access to non&#8208;benzenoid bis&#8208;helicenes, whose open&#8208;shell character depends on the connectivity between spin centers.







Abstract
Diradicaloid helicenes constructed formally by non&#8208;benzenoid double &#960;&#8208;extension of phenanthrene were synthesized by a common strategy involving double electrophilic benzannulation. Steric effects in the second benzannulation step led to considerable structural diversity among the products, yielding a symmetrical dinor[7]helicene 1 and two isomeric unsymmetrical double helicenes 2 and 3, containing a nor[5]helicene and [4]helicene fragment, respectively, in addition to a common nor[6]helicene motif. Geometries, configurational dynamics, and electronic structure of these helicenes were analyzed using solid&#8208;state structures, spectroscopic methods, and computational analyses. The open&#8208;shell character of the singlet states of these helicenes increases in the order 3&lt;1&lt;2, with strongly varying diradicaloid indexes and singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Compounds 1&#8211;3 displayed narrow optical gaps of 0.79&#8211;1.25&#8197;eV, resulting in significant absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region. They also exhibit reversible redox chemistry, each of them yielding stable radical cations, radical anions, and dianions, in some cases possessing intense NIR absorptions extending beyond 2500&#8197;nm.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Induced Charge Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering on a Semiconductor: Toward Amplification&#8208;Free Quantification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu2O nanoarray with a significant enhancement factor of 3.19&#215;1010 was developed as a highly sensitive and selective surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering device for the amplification&#8208;free SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA testing. The nanoarray chip has a low detection limit for the virus, down to 60&#8197;copies/mL within 5&#8197;min, which also enabled rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care quantification of other emerging virus variants.







Abstract
Semiconductors demonstrate great potentials as chemical mechanism&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates in determination of biological species in complex living systems with high selectivity. However, low sensitivity is the bottleneck for their practical applications, compared with that of noble metal&#8208;based Raman enhancement ascribed to electromagnetic mechanism. Herein, a novel Cu2O nanoarray with free carrier density of 1.78&#215;1021&#8197;cm&#8722;3 comparable to that of noble metals was self&#8208;assembled, creating a record in enhancement factor (EF) of 3.19&#215;1010 among semiconductor substrates. The significant EF was mainly attributed to plasmon&#8208;induced hot electron transfer (PIHET) in semiconductor which was never reported before. This Cu2O nanoarray was subsequently developed as a highly sensitive and selective SERS chip for non&#8208;enzyme and amplification&#8208;free SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA quantification with a detection limit down to 60&#8197;copies/mL within 5&#8197;min. This unique Cu2O nanoarray demonstrated the significant Raman enhancement through PIHET process, enabling rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of emerging virus variants.

The 2D components serve as a &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; to heal the defects and toughen the buried heterointerfaces, yielding an efficiency of 22.5&#8201;% for fast&#8208;annealed perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
The 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures have been widely investigated to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, rational manipulation of phase distribution and energy level alignment in such 2D/3D perovskite hybrids are still of great challenge. Herein, we successfully achieved spontaneous phase alignment of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures by concurrently introducing both 2D perovskite component and organic halide additive. The graded phase distribution of 2D perovskites with different n values and 3D perovskites induced favorable energy band alignment across the perovskite film and boosted the charge transfer at the relevant heterointerfaces. Moreover, the 2D perovskite component also acted as a &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; to simultaneously passivate the defects and release the residual tensile stress of perovskite films. Encouragingly, the blade&#8208;coated PSCs based on only &#8776;2&#8197;s in&#8208;situ fast annealed 2D/3D perovskite films with favorable energy funnels and toughened heterointerfaces achieved promising efficiencies of 22.5&#8201;%, accompanied by extended lifespan. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported efficiency for the PSCs fabricated with energy&#8208;saved thermal treatment just within a few seconds, which also outperformed those state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art annealing&#8208;free analogues. Such a two&#8208;second&#8208;in&#8208;situ&#8208;annealing technique could save the energy cost by up to 99.6&#8201;% during device fabrication, which will grant its low&#8208;coast implementation.

         <title>Electronic Interactions on Platinum/(Metal&#8208;Oxide)&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Boost Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4, with a CH4 selectivity of 100&#8201;%, is achieved on a CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst. Electronic Pt&#8722;In2O3 interactions are beneficial for charge separation and CO2 conversion to CO2&#948;&#8722;, which can be easily hydrogenated into CH4. The enhancement effect of electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions on selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 may extend to other common Pt/(metal&#8208;oxide)&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
By supporting platinum (Pt) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles on indium oxide (In2O3), we fabricated a CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst. Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) was achieved on CdS/Pt/In2O3 with electronic Pt&#8722;In2O3 interactions, with CH4 selectivity reaching to 100&#8201;%, which is higher than that on CdS/Pt/In2O3 without electronic Pt&#8722;In2O3 interactions (71.7&#8201;%). Moreover, the enhancement effect of electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions on selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 also occurs by using other common metal oxides, such as photocatalyst supports, including titanium oxide, gallium oxide, zinc oxide, and tungsten oxide. The electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions separate photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and convert CO2 into CO2&#948;&#8722;, which can be easily hydrogenated into CH4 via a CO2&#948;&#8722;&#8594;HCOO*&#8594;HCO*&#8594;CH*&#8594;CH4 path, thus boosting selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. This offers a new way to achieve selective photoreduction of CO2.

         <title>NH4+ Charge Carrier Coordinated H&#8208;Bonded Organic Small Molecule for Fast and Superstable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>

Ultrastable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks between octuple&#8208;active 2, 7&#8208;dinitropyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone and tetrahedral NH4+ charge carrier are designed, which conquers its stability barrier in aqueous electrolyte and achieves fast diffusion kinetics of non&#8208;metallic charge carrier. A unique two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron NH4+ coordination mechanism brings the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, superior rate capability and superstable cyclability.







Abstract
Organic small molecules as high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Zn&#8208;organic batteries have inspired numerous interests, but are trapped by their easy&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes. Here we knit ultrastable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks between 2, 7&#8208;dinitropyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (DNPT) and NH4+ charge carrier. DNPT with octuple&#8208;active carbonyl/nitro centers (H&#8208;bond acceptor) are redox&#8208;exclusively accessible for flexible tetrahedral NH4+ ions (H&#8208;bond donator) but exclude larger and rigid Zn2+, due to a lower activation energy (0.14 vs. 0.31&#8197;eV). NH4+ coordinated H&#8208;bonding chemistry conquers the stability barrier of DNPT in electrolyte, and gives fast diffusion kinetics of non&#8208;metallic charge carrier. A stable two&#8208;step 4e&#8722; NH4+ coordination with DNPT cathode harvests a high capacity (320&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), a high&#8208;rate capability (50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an ultralong life (60,000 cycles). This finding points to a new paradigm for H&#8208;bond stabilized organic small molecules to design advanced zinc batteries.

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen Bond Network Enables High Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aqueous hybrid high&#8208;pressure electrolyte has been developed by incorporating DMF and PEG400 as co&#8208;solvents, enabling the reconfiguration of hydrogen bonding networks in water and control over the interfacial transfer processes. This electrolyte exhibits a wider electrochemical stability window, significantly enhancing the stability and cycling lifespan of assembled zinc ion supercapacitors under high pressure.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage aqueous rechargeable energy storage devices with safety and high specific energy are hopeful candidates for the future energy storage system. However, the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes is a great challenge. Herein, inspired by density functional theory (DFT), polyethylene glycol (PEG) can interact strongly with water molecules, effectively reconstructing the hydrogen bond network. In addition, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) can coordinate with Zn2+, assisting in the rapid desolvation of Zn2+ and stable plating/stripping process. Remarkably, by introducing PEG400 and DMF as co&#8208;solvents into the electrolyte, a wide electrochemical window of 4.27&#8197;V can be achieved. The shift in spectra indicate the transformation in the number and strength of hydrogen bonds, verifying the reconstruction of hydrogen bond network, which can largely inhibit the activity of water molecule, according well with the molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and online electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OEMS). Based on this electrolyte, symmetric Zn cells survived up to 5000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high voltage aqueous zinc ion supercapacitors assembled with Zn anode and activated carbon cathode achieved 800&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides a feasible approach for constructing high&#8208;voltage alkali metal ion supercapacitors through reconstruction strategy of hydrogen bond network.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Water and Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two thiophene&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks were constructed, which enabled overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis with high production yields in the absence of sacrificial agents. A synergistic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) occurred under visible light in water and seawater to produce H2O2.







Abstract
H2O2 is a significant chemical widely utilized in the environmental and industrial fields, with growing global demand. Without sacrificial agents, simultaneous photocatalyzed H2O2 synthesis through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels from seawater is green and sustainable but still challenging. Herein, two novel thiophene&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (TD&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF) were first constructed and served as catalysts for H2O2 synthesis via indirect 2e&#8722; ORR and direct 2e&#8722; WOR channels. The photocatalytic H2O2 production performance can be regulated by adjusting the N&#8208;heterocycle modules (pyridine and triazine) in COFs. Notably, with no sacrificial agents, just using air and water as raw materials, TD&#8208;COF exhibited high H2O2 production yields of 4060&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 3364&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in deionized water and natural seawater, respectively. Further computational mechanism studies revealed that the thiophene was the primary photoreduction unit for ORR, while the benzene ring (linked to the thiophene by the imine bond) was the central photooxidation unit for WOR. The current work exploits thiophene&#8208;containing COFs for overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via ORR and WOR dual channels and provides fresh insight into creating innovative catalysts for photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Bromination, Chlorination and Thiocyanation Using Inorganic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative halogenation typically requires stoichiometric strong oxidants or electrophilic halogenating agents. It is now shown that simple inorganic halide salts can be used for halogenation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide&#8208;activated carboxylic acids under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Halodecarboxylation proceeded with LiBr and LiCl, and the generality of the conditions was demonstrated by extension to decarboxylative thiocyanation with KSCN.







Abstract
Decarboxylative halogenation reactions of alkyl carboxylic acids are highly valuable reactions for the synthesis of structurally diverse alkyl halides. However, many reported protocols rely on stoichiometric strong oxidants or highly electrophilic halogenating agents. Herein, we describe visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative halogenation reactions of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide&#8208;activated carboxylic acids that avoid stoichiometric oxidants and use inexpensive inorganic halide salts as the halogenating agents. Bromination with lithium bromide proceeds under simple, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions using an organic photoredox catalyst and no other additives, whereas dual photoredox&#8208;copper catalysis is required for chlorination with lithium chloride. The mild conditions display excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, which is demonstrated through the transformation of a diverse range of structurally complex carboxylic acid containing natural products into the corresponding alkyl bromides and chlorides. In addition, we show the generality of the dual photoredox&#8208;copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalization with inorganic salts by extension to thiocyanation with potassium thiocyanide, which was applied to the synthesis of complex alkyl thiocyanates.

&#8220;Dual&#8208;key&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221; NIR&#8208;II NSCyanine dyes have been developed by harnessing a non&#8208;symmetric strategy, which enables activatable liver imaging and therapy with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in extrahepatic diseases, including metastasis&#8208;imaging, acute gastritis&#8208;imaging, bacteria infected wound healing, and tumor ablation via combined photothermal therapy and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Conventional cyanine dyes with a symmetric structure are &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221;, which can easily accumulate in the liver and display high liver background fluorescence, inevitably interfering the accurate diagnosis and therapy in extrahepatic diseases. We herein report a platform of NIR&#8208;II non&#8208;symmetric cyanine (NSCyanine) dyes by harnessing a non&#8208;symmetric strategy, which are extremely sensitive to pH/viscosity and can be activated via a &#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221; strategy. These NSCyanine dyes with a low pKa (&lt;4.0) only show weak fluorescence at lysosome pH (key1), however, the fluorescence can be completely switched on and significantly enhanced by intracellular viscosity (key2) in disease tissues, exhibiting high target&#8208;to&#8208;liver ratios up to 19.5/1. Notably, high&#8208;contrast phototheranostics in extrahepatic diseases are achieved, including intestinal metastasis&#8208;imaging, acute gastritis&#8208;imaging, bacteria infected wound healing, and tumor ablation via targeted combined photothermal therapy and chemotherapy.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;metal Ionothermal Synthesis of Metallophthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present efficient synthesis of metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under mixed&#8208;metal ionothermal conditions starting from aryl cyanides. These conjugated COFs followed the Irving&#8211;Williams series in terms of their metal content, surface areas and pore volumes, thus offering a versatile and highly tunable platform to synthesize various COFs, and showed highly competitive CO2 capture and conversion properties.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines (PCs) are intriguing building blocks owing to their stability, physicochemical and catalytic properties. Although PC&#8208;based polymers have been reported before, many suffer from relatively low stability, crystallinity, and low surface areas. Utilizing a mixed&#8208;metal salt ionothermal approach, we report the synthesis of a series of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene and 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetracyanoanthracene to form the corresponding COFs named M&#8208;pPPCs and M&#8208;anPPCs, respectively. The obtained COFs followed the Irving&#8211;Williams series in their metal contents, surface areas, and pore volume and featured excellent CO2 uptake capacities up to 7.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 273&#8197;K, 1.1&#8197;bar. We also investigated the growth of the Co&#8208;pPPC and Co&#8208;anPPC on a highly conductive carbon nanofiber and demonstrated their high catalytic activity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction, which showed Faradaic efficiencies towards CO up to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;0.64&#8197;V vs. RHE.

         <title>Constructing Fe&#8208;N4 Sites through Anion Exchange&#8208;mediated Transformation of Fe Coordination Environments in Hierarchical Carbon Support for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;N4 sites in hierarchical carbon support composed of hollow carbon spheres (Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS) are obtained by a demonstrated in situ anion exchange process, during which the coordinating O atoms in Fe&#8208;O4 configuration are substituted by N atoms. The distinct strategy produces a large quantity of electrochemically accessible Fe&#8208;N4 sites. Thus, Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS is an outstanding electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Metal single atoms (SAs) anchored in carbon support via coordinating with N atoms are efficient active sites to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, rational design of single atom catalysts with highly exposed active sites is challenging and urgently desirable. Herein, an anion exchange strategy is presented to fabricate Fe&#8208;N4 moieties anchored in hierarchical carbon nanoplates composed of hollow carbon spheres (Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS). With the coordinating O atoms are substituted by N atoms, Fe SAs with Fe&#8208;O4 configuration are transformed into the ones with Fe&#8208;N4 configuration during the thermal activation process. Insights into the evolution of central atoms demonstrate that the SAs with specific coordination environment can be obtained by modulating in situ anion exchange process. The strategy produces a large quantity of electrochemical accessible site and high utilization rate of Fe&#8208;N4. Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS shows excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, and outstanding performance when used in rechargeable aqueous and flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries. The evolution pathway for SAs demonstrated in this work offers a novel strategy to design SACs with various coordination environment and enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

A main&#8208;group catalysis&#8208;based strategy to access 8&#8208;membered carbocycles via the direct carbofunctionalization of 2&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes is disclosed. Through the intervention of an I(I)/I(III) catalysis cycle, the synthesis of densely functionalized, fluorinated benzocyclooctenes can be achieved in an operationally simple manner. Modulating the oxidation/activation regime, and the external nucleophile, the process has been extended to unify the challenging cyclization with formation of allylic C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;C bonds (&gt;30 examples).

         <title>Solvation Modulation Enhances Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Deep Cycling of Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is reported as an electrolyte additive to achieve deep cycling of Zn anodes. HMPA reshapes the solvation structures and promotes anion (OTF&#8722;) decomposition, which in situ forms an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. More interestingly, this anion decomposition does not involve HMPA, which is beneficial for its long&#8208;term impact on the electrolyte.







Abstract
Stable Zn anodes with a high utilization efficiency pose a challenge due to notorious dendrite growth and severe side reactions. Therefore, electrolyte additives are developed to address these issues. However, the additives are always consumed by the electrochemical reactions over cycling, affecting the cycling stability. Here, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is reported as an electrolyte additive for achieving stable cycling of Zn anodes. HMPA reshapes the solvation structures and promotes anion decomposition, leading to the in situ formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. More interestingly, this anion decomposition does not involve HMPA, preserving its long&#8208;term impact on the electrolyte. Thus, the symmetric cells with HMPA in the electrolyte survive &#8776;500&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or &#8776;200&#8197;h at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Zn utilization rate of 85.6&#8201;%. The full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio=12&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.8) and a high areal capacity (6.6&#8197;mAh&#8197;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Strong Inhibition of Ice Growth by Biomimetic Crowding Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimetic the membrane&#8208;less organelles inside cells, we fabricated coacervates consisting of various components. It is firstly discovered that the crowding coacervates exhibit strong ice growth inhibition activity. It opens a completely new avenue to design ice&#8208;controlling materials for the cryopreservation of biological samples and may provide new insights into the survival of freezing&#8208;tolerant organisms.







Abstract
The freezing of biological fluids is intensively studied but remains elusive as it is affected not only by the various components but also by the crowding nature of the biological fluids. Herein, we constructed spherical crowders, fibrous crowders, and coacervates by various components ranging from surfactants to polymers and proteins, to mimic three typical crowders in biological fluids, i.e., globular proteins, fibrous networks, and condensates of biomolecules. It is elucidated that the three crowders exhibit low, moderate, and strong ice growth inhibition activity, respectively, resulting from their different abilities in slowing down water dynamics. Intriguingly, the coacervate consisting of molecules without obvious ice growth inhibition activity strongly inhibits ice growth, which is firstly employed as a highly&#8208;potent cryoprotectant. This work provides new insights into the survival of freezing&#8208;tolerant organisms and opens an avenue for the design of ice&#8208;controlling materials.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polymethacrylates made by ATRP and RAFT polymerization: High&#8208;Yielding Depolymerization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low temperature and solvent&#8208;free method to depolymerize polymers made by ATRP and RAFT is reported. By performing an efficient end&#8208;group modification, the modified polymers were subsequently successfully depolymerized, resulting in up to 90&#8201;% monomer regeneration at temperatures as low as 220&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the process was scalable and the monomer produced had high purity and could subsequently be used to make a new batch of polymer.







Abstract
Although controlled radical polymerization is an excellent tool to make precision polymeric materials, reversal of the process to retrieve the starting monomer is far less explored despite the significance of chemical recycling. Here, we investigate the bulk depolymerization of RAFT and ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers under identical conditions. RAFT&#8208;synthesized polymers undergo a relatively low&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free depolymerization back to monomer thanks to the partial in situ transformation of the RAFT end&#8208;group to macromonomer.

     alt="Solvent-Free Chemical Recycling of Polymethacrylates made by ATRP and RAFT polymerization: High-Yielding Depolymerization at Low Temperatures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low temperature and solvent-free method to depolymerize polymers made by ATRP and RAFT is reported. By performing an efficient end-group modification, the modified polymers were subsequently successfully depolymerized, resulting in up to 90&#8201;% monomer regeneration at temperatures as low as 220&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the process was scalable and the monomer produced had high purity and could subsequently be used to make a new batch of polymer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although controlled radical polymerization is an excellent tool to make precision polymeric materials, reversal of the process to retrieve the starting monomer is far less explored despite the significance of chemical recycling. Here, we investigate the bulk depolymerization of RAFT and ATRP-synthesized polymers under identical conditions. RAFT-synthesized polymers undergo a relatively low-temperature solvent-free depolymerization back to monomer thanks to the partial in situ transformation of the RAFT end-group to macromonomer. Instead, ATRP-synthesized polymers can only depolymerize at significantly higher temperatures (&amp;gt;350&#8201;&#176;C) through random backbone scission. To aid a more complete depolymerization at even lower temperatures, we performed a facile and quantitative end-group modification strategy in which both ATRP and RAFT end-groups were successfully converted to macromonomers. The macromonomers triggered a lower temperature bulk depolymerization with an onset at 150&#8201;&#176;C yielding up to 90&#8201;% of monomer regeneration. The versatility of the methodology was demonstrated by a scalable depolymerization (&#8776;10&#8197;g of starting polymer) retrieving 84&#8201;% of the starting monomer intact which could be subsequently used for further polymerization. This work presents a new low-energy approach for depolymerizing controlled radical polymers and creates many future opportunities as high-yielding, solvent-free and scalable depolymerization methods are sought.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Hydrolytically degradable block copolymer nanoparticles are prepared via reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in aqueous media. This efficient protocol involves the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMAC) using a monofunctional or bifunctional trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) precursor. DMAC monomer is employed as a co&#8208;solvent to solubilize the hydrophobic PCL chains. At an intermediate DMAC conversion of 20&#8211;60&#8201;%, the reaction mixture is diluted with water to 10&#8211;25&#8201;%&#8201;w/w solids. The growing amphiphilic block copolymer chains undergo nucleation to form sterically&#8208;stabilized PCL&#8208;core nanoparticles with PDMAC coronas. 1H&#8197;NMR studies confirm more than 99&#8201;% DMAC conversion while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) studies indicate well&#8208;controlled RAFT polymerizations (Mw/Mn&#8804;1.30). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicate spheres of 20&#8211;120&#8197;nm diameter. As expected, hydrolytic degradation occurs within days at 37&#8201;&#176;C in either acidic or alkaline solution. Degradation is also observed in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) (pH&#8197;7.4) at 37&#8201;&#176;C. However, no degradation is detected over a three&#8208;month period when these nanoparticles are stored at 20&#8201;&#176;C in deionized water (pH&#8197;6.7). Finally, PDMAC30&#8208;PCL16&#8208;PDMAC30 nanoparticles are briefly evaluated as a dispersant for an agrochemical formulation based on a broad&#8208;spectrum fungicide (azoxystrobin).

         <dc:description>
A histidine&#8208;rich endosomal escape peptide, as described by Juanjuan Du et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202304692), is capable of mediating efficient endosome&#8208;to&#8208;cytosol transport of peptide/protein cargo, depicted in the cover picture as butterflies escaping from bubbles trapping them. Once combined with antibody&#8208;mediated endocytosis, this strategy enables cell&#8208;specific cytosolic delivery of functional proteins.

A new click chemistry generated artificial metallonuclease is reported in the Research Article by Andrew Kellett et&#8197;al. (e202305759). The oxidative DNA damaging properties of a polynuclear copper binding ligand called TC&#8208;Thio is demonstrated. Copper&#8208;TC&#8208;Thio binds in the minor groove of genomic DNA and promotes damage via a superoxide linked mechanism. The inset picture shows copper ions, bound to the TC&#8208;Thio ligand, melting into the DNA duplex and filling the reaction chamber with molten liquid DNA.

Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are appealing optoelectronic devices with potential application in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area display technology and disposable devices for telecommunication, night&#8208;vision displays and phototherapeutics. Bimetallic copper(I) complexes were synthetized and investigated by Abdelaziz Jouaiti, Hai&#8208;Ching Su, Matteo Mauro et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202305569). These earth&#8208;abundant compounds were demonstrated as suitable emitters for solution&#8208;processed LECs with electroluminescence into the NIR region.

         <title>Design Strategies for Diradical Boron/Nitrogen Doped Carbon&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>

A new design strategy reported in Angewandte Chemie by Guo et&#8197;al. involving the doping of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with boron and nitrogen atoms leads to an increase of the diradical character and offers potential applications in the fields of organic electronics and spintronics.







Abstract
New heterocyclic diradicaloids based on boron and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic systems with open&#8208;shell ground&#8208;states are obtained via concomitant structural and quinoidal extensions, thus allowing to merge the best of both design strategies. A combination of experimental characterization and theoretical calculations have helped disclose their electronic structure, as well as rationalize their associated magnetic and photophysical properties, spanning the chemical space of available molecular templates for cutting&#8208;edge applications in organic electronics and spintronics.

         <title>The Metabolostasis Network and the Cellular Depository of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolites are essential building blocks required for cellular function. Yet, like proteins, they tend to form toxic aggregates. Here, we expand the resemblance between protein and metabolite self&#8208;assembly, discussing the metastability of the soluble state of the latter. We suggest that a quality&#8208;control network, termed &#8220;metabolostasis&#8221;, has evolved to regulate the storage and retrieval of aggregation&#8208;prone metabolites and prevent disease onset.







Abstract
The vital role of metabolites across all branches of life and their involvement in various disorders have been investigated for decades. Many metabolites are poorly soluble in water or in physiological buffers and tend to form supramolecular aggregates. On the other hand, in the cell, they should be preserved in a pool and be readily available for the execution of biochemical functions. We thus propose that a quality&#8208;control network, termed &#8220;metabolostasis&#8221;, has evolved to regulate the storage and retrieval of aggregation&#8208;prone metabolites. Such a system should control metabolite concentration, subcellular localization, supramolecular arrangement, and interaction in dynamic environments, thus enabling normal cellular physiology, healthy development, and preventing disease onset. The paradigm&#8208;shifting concept of metabolostasis calls for a reevaluation of the traditional view of metabolite storage and dynamics in physiology and pathology and proposes unprecedented directions for therapeutic targets under conditions where metabolostasis is imbalanced.

         <title>Recent Progress on Electrode Design for Efficient Electrochemical Valorisation of CO2, O2, and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>

Electrode design is key to developing electrochemical gas reduction reactions for sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals. This review examines the present challenges in electrode design, proposes a desirable electrode that mitigates the challenges, and provides practical solutions to construct such an electrode based on recent research.







Abstract
CO2 reduction, two&#8208;electron O2 reduction, and N2 reduction are sustainable technologies to valorise common molecules. Their further development requires working electrode design to promote the multistep electrochemical processes from gas reactants to value&#8208;added products at the device level. This review proposes critical features of a desirable electrode based on the fundamental electrochemical processes and the development of scalable devices. A detailed discussion is made to approach such a desirable electrode, addressing the recent progress on critical electrode components, assembly strategies, and reaction interface engineering. Further, we highlight the electrode design tailored to reaction properties (e.g., its thermodynamics and kinetics) for performance optimisation. Finally, the opportunities and remaining challenges are presented, providing a framework for rational electrode design to push these gas reduction reactions towards an improved technology readiness level (TRL).

         <title>Perovskite Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>

Halide perovskites have emerged as competitive scintillators for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging owing to their intrinsic characteristics. This minireview summarizes strategies for improving the light yield of halide perovskite scintillators and offers a roadmap for advancing the X&#8208;ray imaging performance. Additionally, methods for controlling the light propagation direction in halide perovskite scintillators are highlighted for improving X&#8208;ray imaging resolution.







Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) recently have emerged as one class of competitive scintillators for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging owing to its high quantum efficiency, short decay time, superior X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, low cost, and ease of crystal growth. The tunable structure and versatile chemical compositions of halide perovskites provide distinguishable advantages over traditional inorganic scintillators for optimizing scintillation performance. Since the first observation of the scintillation phenomenon in HPs, substantial efforts have been devoted to expanding the inventory of HP scintillators and regulating material properties. Understanding the relationship between the structure and scintillation properties of HP scintillators is essential for developing materials with improved X&#8208;ray detection and imaging capacities. This review summarizes strategies for improving the light yield of HP scintillators and provides a roadmap for improving the X&#8208;ray imaging performance. Additionally, methods for controlling the light propagation direction in HP scintillators are highlighted for improving X&#8208;ray imaging resolution. Finally, we highlight the current challenge in HP scintillators and provide a perspective on the future development of this emerging scintillator.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl radical diversification has emerged as one of the most powerful approaches to access various categories of valuable glycosyl compounds. Advances in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling and metallaphotoredox catalysis offer new avenues for constructing these sugar molecules with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. A summary of the most recent developments in glycosyl radical functionalization methods for carbohydrate synthesis is highlighted in this Review.







Abstract
Glycosyl radical functionalization is one of the central topics in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Recent advances in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling chemistry and metallaphotoredox catalysis provided powerful platforms for glycosyl radical diversification. In particular, the discovery of new glycosyl radical precursors in conjunction with these advanced reaction technologies have significantly expanded the space for glycosyl compound synthesis. In this Review, we highlight the most recent progress in this area starting from 2021, and the reports included will be categorized based on different reaction types for better clarity.

         <title>Fused Indacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two fused indacene dimer isomers (s&#8208;ID and as&#8208;ID) have been synthesized and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. They both display an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. s&#8208;ID has localized antiaromaticity on the s&#8208;indacene units, while as&#8208;ID shows weak global aromaticity. Additionally, as&#8208;ID has a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap as compared to s&#8208;ID.







Abstract
Polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of two or more directly fused antiaromatic subunits are rare due to their high reactivity. However, it is important to understand how the interactions between the antiaromatic subunits influence the electronic properties of the fused structure. Herein, we present the synthesis of two fused indacene dimer isomers: s&#8208;indaceno[2,1&#8208;a]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (s&#8208;ID) and as&#8208;indaceno[3,2&#8208;b]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene (as&#8208;ID), containing two fused antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or as&#8208;indacene units, respectively. Their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. 1H&#8197;NMR/ESR measurements and DFT calculations revealed that both s&#8208;ID and as&#8208;ID have an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. However, while localized antiaromaticity was observed in s&#8208;ID, as&#8208;ID showed weak global aromaticity. Moreover, as&#8208;ID exhibited a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap than s&#8208;ID. All the differences can be attributed to their distinct quinoidal substructures.

         <title>Coordination Tuning of Metal Porphyrins for Improved Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal porphyrins with a coordinatively unsaturated metal ion are designed for improved O2 evolution catalysis. By sterically protecting one porphyrin side with a cyclen, five&#8208;coordinate metal&#8208;oxo with an unoccupied trans axial site is proposed to be produced in O2 evolution. Theoretical studies showed that this five&#8208;coordinate structure enables more positively charged metal&#8208;oxo units, which is favoured for nucleophilic attack to form O&#8722;O bonds.







Abstract
The nucleophilic attack of water or hydroxide on metal&#8208;oxo units forms an O&#8722;O bond in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Coordination tuning to improve this attack is intriguing but has been rarely realized. We herein report on improved OER catalysis by metal porphyrin 1&#8208;M (M=Co, Fe) with a coordinatively unsaturated metal ion. We designed and synthesized 1&#8208;M by sterically blocking one porphyrin side with a tethered tetraazacyclododecane unit. With this protection, the metal&#8208;oxo species generated in OER can maintain an unoccupied trans axial site. Importantly, 1&#8208;M displays a higher OER activity in alkaline solutions than analogues lacking such an axial protection by decreasing up to 150&#8208;mV overpotential to achieve 10&#8197;mA/cm2 current density. Theoretical studies suggest that with an unoccupied trans axial site, the metal&#8208;oxo unit becomes more positively charged and thus is more favoured for the hydroxide nucleophilic attack as compared to metal&#8208;oxo units bearing trans axial ligands.

Here, we show that phosphate and/or biogenic amines mediate the non&#8208;enzymatic &#945;&#8208;methylenation of butyraldehyde under biocompatible reaction conditions and can be interfaced with butyraldehyde biosynthesis from D&#8208;glucose in the bacterium Escherichia coli.







Abstract
Small molecule organocatalysts are abundant in all living organisms. However, their use as organocatalysts in cells has been underexplored. Herein, we report that organocatalytic aldol chemistry can be interfaced with living Escherichia coli to enable the &#945;&#8208;methylenation of cellular aldehydes using biogenic amines such as L&#8208;Pro or phosphate. The biocompatible reaction is mild and can be interfaced with butyraldehyde generated from D&#8208;glucose via engineered metabolism to enable the production of 2&#8208;methylenebutanal (2&#8208;MB) and 2&#8208;methylbutanal (2&#8208;MBA) by anaerobic fermentation, and 2&#8208;methylbutanol (2&#8208;MBO) by whole&#8208;cell catalysis. Overall, this study demonstrates the combination of non&#8208;enzymatic organocatalytic and metabolic reactions in vivo for the sustainable synthesis of valuable non&#8208;natural chemicals that cannot be accessed using enzymatic chemistry alone.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Imaging of Nascent DNA in Live Cells by Monitoring the Fluorescence Lifetime of DNA&#8208;Incorporated Thiazole Orange&#8208;Modified Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) nucleotide&#160;modified with a thiazole orange moiety shows different fluorescence lifetimes in living cells depending on whether it is present as a free triphosphate or as a DNA&#8208;incorporated nucleotide. Due to this unique property, DNA synthesis in live cells can be monitored in real time using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.







Abstract
A modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate derivative (dCTOTP) bearing a thiazole orange moiety tethered via an oligoethylene glycol linker was designed and synthesized. The nucleotide was incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerases in vitro as well as in live cells. Upon incorporation of dCTOTP into DNA, the thiazole orange moiety exhibited a fluorescence lifetime that differed significantly from the non&#8208;incorporated (i.e. free and non&#8208;covalently intercalated) forms of dCTOTP. When dCTOTP was delivered into live U&#8208;2 OS cells using a synthetic nucleoside triphosphate transporter, it allowed us to distinguish and monitor cells that were actively synthesizing DNA in real time, from the very first moments after the treatment. We anticipate that this probe could be used to study chromatin organization and dynamics.

         <title>Accelerating Ethanol Complete Electrooxidation via Introducing Ethylene as the Precursor for the C&#8722;C Bond Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique ethylene&#8208;mediated pathway with a 100&#8201;% C1&#8208;selectivity for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is proposed for the first time based on a well&#8208;structured Pt/Al2O3@TiAl catalyst, in which Al2O3 is responsible for generating ethylene from ethanol dehydration while Pt boosts the complete oxidation of ethylene to CO2.







Abstract
The crucial issue restricting the application of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) is the incomplete and sluggish electrooxidation of ethanol due to the chemically stable C&#8722;C bond thereof. Herein, a unique ethylene&#8208;mediated pathway with a 100&#8201;% C1&#8208;selectivity for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is proposed for the first time based on a well&#8208;structured Pt/Al2O3@TiAl catalyst with cascade active sites. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) analysis disclose that ethanol is primarily dehydrated on the surface of Al2O3@TiAl and the derived ethylene is further oxidized completely on nanostructured Pt. X&#8208;ray absorption and density functional theory (DFT) studies disclose the Al component doped in Pt nanocrystals can promote the EOR kinetics by lowering the reaction energy barriers and eliminating the poisonous species. Strikingly, Pt/Al2O3@TiAl exhibits a specific activity of 3.83&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2Pt, 7.4 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and superior long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Chiroptical Amplification of Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Nucleotide&#8208;Templated Supramolecular Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented bioinspired, chiroptical amplification of induced&#8208;circularly polarized luminescence (ICPL) is demonstrated in ATP&#8208;driven cooperative supramolecular polymers. Amplification of asymmetry is achieved using a mixture of ATP and achiral pyrophosphate (PPi) guests, whereas the high luminescence is ensured by the aggregation&#8208;induced emissive nature of the monomers.







Abstract
Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from purely organic molecules holds great promise for applications in displays, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high dissymmetry values (glum) from organic chromophores remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a bioinspired approach using adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;triggered supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene diimide&#8208;derived monomer (ANSG) to induce CPL with a remarkable glum value of 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2. The ANSG molecules undergo a templated, chiral self&#8208;assembly through a cooperative growth mechanism in the presence of ATP, resulting in scrolled nanotubes with aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) and induced CPL. Furthermore, we demonstrate the concept of chiroptical amplification of induced CPL by efficiently amplifying asymmetry using a mixture of chiral ATP and achiral pyrophosphate. This innovative approach opens numerous opportunities in the emerging field of circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Coupling Titanium and Chromium Catalysis in a Reaction Network for the Reprogramming of [BH4]&#8722; as Electron Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reagent for Radical Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
From catalytic cycles to a catalytic globe by efficient coupling of two earth&#8208;abundant metals titanium and chromium. Reprogramming the typical hydride character of borohydrides to a stepwise electron and H&#8208;atom transfer reagent allows epoxide reduction, C&#8722;C bond formation and regiodivergent epoxide opening in an unusual manner by avoiding SN2&#8208;type reactivity of [BH4]&#8722;. The readily available Li[BH4] is used as sole stoichiometric reagent.







Abstract
We describe a unique catalytic system with an efficient coupling of Ti&#8208; and Cr&#8208;catalysis in a reaction network that allows the use of [BH4]&#8722; as stoichiometric hydrogen atom and electron donor in catalytic radical chemistry. The key feature is a relay hydrogen atom transfer from [BH4]&#8722; to Cr generating the active catalysts under mild conditions. This enables epoxide reductions, regiodivergent epoxide opening and radical cyclizations that are not possible with cooperative catalysis with radicals or by epoxide reductions via Meinwald rearrangement and ensuing carbonyl reduction. No typical SN2&#8208;type reactivity of [BH4]&#8722; salts is observed.

         <title>Access to Trifluoromethylketones from Alkyl Bromides and Trifluoroacetic Anhydride by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methods for direct access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones from feedstocks remain underdeveloped, partially owing to the high reactivity and instability of the trifluoroacetyl radical. Reported herein is the photocatalytic synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones from alkyl bromides and trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction features visible&#8208;light catalysis and halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT), followed by an enabling radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of the alkyl radical with a stabilized trifluoroacetyl radical.







Abstract
Aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones are a type of unique fluorine&#8208;containing subunit which play a significant role in altering the physical and biological properties of molecules. Catalytic methods to provide direct access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones are highly desirable yet remain underdeveloped, partially owing to the high reactivity and instability of trifluoroacetyl radical. Herein, we report a photocatalytic synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones from alkyl bromides with trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction features dual visible&#8208;light and halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysis, followed by an enabling radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of an alkyl radical with a stabilized trifluoromethyl radical. The reaction provides straightforward access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones from readily available and cost&#8208;effective alkyl halides and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA).

         <title>H2&#8208;free Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Butadiene by the Atomic Sieving Effect of Pd Membrane with Tree&#8208;like Pd Dendrites Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen atomic sieving of Pd&#8208;based membrane under electrochemical condition was developed for solving the challenges of high energy consumption and safety hazards of the conventional thermocatalytic selective hydrogenation route. The Pd membrane with an array of tree&#8208;like Pd nanodendrites as the core device in the developed continuous flow reactor exhibits superior catalytic performance, with an elimination of extra impurities for a high industrial applicability.







Abstract
H2&#8208;free semi&#8208;hydrogenation at room temperature shows great advantage for replacing the thermocatalytic process in industry owing to the high energy and resource saving, however, remains great challenges. Herein, a tree&#8208;like Pd dendrites array decorated Pd membrane was constructed as the core device in an electrochemistry assisted gas&#8208;fed membrane reactor for butadiene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. It reveals that hydrogen atomic sieving effect of this Pd&#8208;based membrane under electrochemical condition was the key for semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The configuration study of Pd nanostructured membrane demonstrates that the penetration of hydrogen atoms through Pd membrane from electrochemical side to chemical side is affected by the consumption of hydrogen atom in semi&#8208;hydrogenation step. Such atomic sieving property of nanostructured Pd membrane with 5.1&#8197;times increase in catalytic active surface area brings above 14&#8197;times higher in butadiene conversion than that of bare Pd foil, with &#8776;90&#8201;% of butenes selectivity at butadiene conversion &#8776;98&#8201;% over 300&#8197;h of H2&#8208;free reaction under 15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Vesicle Signal Transduction Using a Photo&#8208;Responsive Zinc Ionophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic inter&#8208;vesicle signalling system is reported in which diffusible chemical signals trigger transmembrane ion transport. Photo&#8208;activation of caged ZnII transporters triggers their release from one population of vesicles and the activation of transport in another remote population of vesicles leading to overall inter&#8208;vesicle signal transduction and amplification.







Abstract
Transmission of chemical information between cells and across lipid bilayer membranes is of profound significance in many biological processes. The design of synthetic signalling systems is a critical step towards preparing artificial cells with collective behaviour. Here, we report the first example of a synthetic inter&#8208;vesicle signalling system, in which diffusible chemical signals trigger transmembrane ion transport in a manner reminiscent of signalling pathways in biology. The system is derived from novel ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl and BODIPY photo&#8208;caged ZnII transporters, in which cation transport is triggered by photo&#8208;decaging with UV or red light, respectively. This decaging reaction can be used to trigger the release of the cationophores from a small population of sender vesicles. This in turn triggers the transport of ions across the membrane of a larger population of receiver vesicles, but not across the sender vesicle membrane, leading to overall inter&#8208;vesicle signal transduction and amplification.

         <title>An Inorganic Click Reaction for the Synthesis of Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative inorganic click reaction that proceeds in solution in the absence of a catalyst has been used as a stoppering strategy for the synthesis of interlocked molecules in good yields (ca. 65&#8201;%). The resulting organometallic rotaxanes are air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable and can be purified by column chromatography under aerobic conditions.







Abstract
We describe the use of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of a new class of inorganic rotaxanes containing gold(I) triazaphosphole stoppers. Electron&#8208;deficient bis&#8208;azides, which thread perethylated pillar[5]arene in aromatic solvents, readily react with two equivalents of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to afford interlocked molecules via an inorganic click reaction. These transformations proceed in good yields (ca. 65&#8201;%) and in the absence of a catalyst. The resulting organometallic rotaxanes are air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable and can be purified by column chromatography under aerobic conditions. The targeted rotaxanes were characterized by multi&#8208;element nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass&#8208;spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Asymmetric Dearomatization of Phenols via Ligand&#8208;Enabled Cooperative Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric dearomatization of phenols was achieved by employing chiral bifunctional phosphine ligands in cooperative gold catalysis. This transformation demonstrated a remarkable generality, affording the desired product with high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivities (ee up to 99&#8201;%).







Abstract
By employing a chiral bifunctional phosphine ligand, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed efficient and highly enantioselective dearomatization of phenols is achieved via versatile metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. The reaction is proven to be remarkably general in scope, permitting substitutions at all four remaining benzene positions, accommodating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups including strongly deactivating nitro, and allowing carbon&#8208;based groups of varying steric bulk including tert&#8208;butyl at the alkyne terminus. Moreover, besides N&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)alkynamides, the corresponding ynoates and ynones are all suitable substrates. Spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones, spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;butenolides, and spirocyclohexadenone&#8208;cyclopentenones are formed in yields up to 99&#8201;% and with ee up to 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Bis&#8208; and Tris&#8208;norbornadienes with High Energy Densities for Efficient Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In search for novel efficient energy storage systems, aryl&#8208;linked bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;norbornadienes were synthesized with promising potential for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) applications. Above all, the assembly of three quadricyclane units in one benzene derivative resulted in a material with exeptionally high energy densities of up to 734&#8197;kJ/kg.







Abstract
Molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems can convert, store and release solar energy in chemical bonds, i.e., as chemical energy. In this work, phenyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;norbornadienes are presented as promising MOST systems with very high energy densities. The substrates were synthesized by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions and their absorption properties and characteristic parameters for MOST applications were investigated. The norbornadiene derivatives showed absorption onsets of up to 386&#8197;nm and photoisomerization quantum yields of 56&#8201;% per photoisomerization event. The resulting quadricyclane products have half&#8208;lifes up to 14 d and very high energy densities of up to 734&#8197;kJ/kg. Overall, these norbornadienes fulfill necessary criteria for an optimal MOST system and are, therefore, a highly promising basis for the development of materials for efficient solar energy conversion and storage.

         <title>eHydrogenation: Hydrogen&#8208;free Electrochemical Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically generated diimide using hydrazine hydrate offers a rapid and practical method to access alkanes and amines through the eHydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, and nitro and azido groups. A wide range of substrates are reduced in high yields. The anodic transformation displays an excellent functional group tolerance, allowing for the late&#8208;stage reduction of biologically relevant compounds.







Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions are staple transformations commonly used across scientific fields to synthesise pharmaceuticals, natural products, and various functional materials. However, the vast majority of these reactions require the use of a toxic and costly catalyst leading to unpractical, hazardous and often functionally limited conditions. Herein, we report a new, general, practical, efficient, mild and high&#8208;yielding hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical method for the reduction of alkene, alkyne, nitro and azido groups. Finally, this method has been applied to deuterium labelling.

         <title>Experimental Quantification of Halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Arene van der Waals Contacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interactions are measured in 17 different solvents using molecular balances. The Me&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interaction was always found to be more favorable than any halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interaction. London dispersion interactions involving the larger, more polarizable halogen atoms are unable to outcompete the electrostatic and steric terms that determine the interaction energy trend.







Abstract
Crystallographic and computational studies suggest the occurrence of favourable interactions between polarizable arenes and halogen atoms. However, the systematic experimental quantification of halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interactions in solution has been hindered by the large variance in the steric demands of the halogens. Here we have synthesized molecular balances to quantify halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene contacts in 17 solvents and solvent mixtures using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Calculations indicate that favourable halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interactions arise from London dispersion in the gas phase. In contrast, comparison of our experimental measurements with partitioned SAPT0 energies indicate that dispersion is sufficiently attenuated by the solvent that the halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interaction trend was instead aligned with increasing exchange repulsion as the halogen increased in size (&#916;GX&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ph=0 to +1.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene contacts were slightly less disfavoured in solvents with higher solvophobicities and lower polarizabilities, but strikingly, were always less favoured than CH3&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene contacts (&#916;GMe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ph=0 to &#8722;1.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence from 2D Assemblies of LnW10 and P2W18 Polyoxometalates Clusters with Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;type AIEgens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we synthesized a two&#8208;dimensional assembly by combining a quaternary ammonium&#8208;type AIE ligand and LnW10 or P2W18 POM clusters. The co&#8208;assembly of the two can be precisely regulated at the atomic scale. The morphology and fluorescence intensity of the SLNSs can be finely tuned. Moreover, SLNSs showed excellent solvent compatibility and emitted intensely in water, chloroform, and ethanol.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) AIE&#8208;inorganic nanocomposites exhibit high stability and high fluorescence activity. However, limited by the types and properties of 2D inorganic materials, it's challenging to realize complex structures and functions. We designed a quaternary ammonium&#8208;type AIE ligand, TPECholine. We chose TPECholine and POM clusters as building blocks and synthesized a series of single&#8208;layer nanosheets (SLNSs) by assembling LnW10 or P2W18 POM clusters with TPECholine. By regulating the types of POM clusters and ligands, the morphology and fluorescence intensity of the SLNSs can be finely tuned. Due to the restriction of the intramolecular motions of AIEgens by the SLNSs, nanosheets can exhibit promoted quantum yield (up to 76&#8201;%). In addition, thanks to the sub&#8208;nanometric sizes and excess surface charges, SLNSs exhibit excellent solvent compatibility, including water, chloroform, ethanol, etc. And the nanosheets showed high fluorescence intensity in these solvents.

         <title>Interfacial Assembly of Nanocrystals on Nanofibers with Strong Interaction for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 38, September 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial assembly method to arrange metal nanocrystals on fiber substrates with strong interaction is demonstrated for optimized electrocatalytic performance. The obtained Fe/NFs assembly structure is proposed as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction to N2, which achieves a high nitrate removal capacity of 2317&#8197;mg N/g Fe and N2 selectivity up to 97.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional fiber architecture serves as an excellent catalyst support. The orderly arrangement of active materials on such a fiber substrate can enhance catalytic performance by exposing more active sites and facilitating mass diffusion; however, this remains a challenge. We developed an interfacial assembly strategy for the orderly distribution of metal nanocrystals on different fiber substrates to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. Using electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) as a representative reaction, the iron&#8208;based nanofibers (Fe/NFs) assembly structure achieved an excellent nitrate removal capacity of 2317&#8197;mg N/g Fe and N2 selectivity up to 97.2&#8201;%. This strategy could promote the rational design and synthesis of fiber&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-dimensional fiber architecture serves as an excellent catalyst support. The orderly arrangement of active materials on such a fiber substrate can enhance catalytic performance by exposing more active sites and facilitating mass diffusion; however, this remains a challenge. We developed an interfacial assembly strategy for the orderly distribution of metal nanocrystals on different fiber substrates to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. Using electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR) as a representative reaction, the iron-based nanofibers (Fe/NFs) assembly structure achieved an excellent nitrate removal capacity of 2317&#8197;mg N/g Fe and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity up to 97.2&#8201;%. This strategy could promote the rational design and synthesis of fiber-based electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&#8220;A great surprise was that out of the 20 base pairs in the iHRAS dimer, only two are canonical &#8230; One hurdle in the iHRAS journey was coordinating students&#226; research efforts across multiple years. Research is not a full&#8208;time job for undergraduates. And even the most dedicated students typically spend only two or three years in the lab&#8230;&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Yatsunyk and Schneekloth Labs.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Kevin Li and Liliya Yatsunyk, Swarthmore College PA (USA) and by John Schneekloth, Jr, (Jay) National Cancer Institute, Frederick MD (USA). They recently published an article on the first crystal structure of an intercalated motif (i&#8208;motif or iM) from the HRAS oncogene involved in many cancers. The iHRAS structure was solved to 1.8&#8197;&#197; resolution. It contains a tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer of two iMs each with six C&#8722;C+ base pairs. The structure is unique in that only two base pairs out of 20 are canonical. The extensive network of capping and connecting interactions is unprecedented. The unique structural elements (loops/connecting region) may be targeted by ligands or proteins as cancer therapies. iHRAS represents the first crystallized iM&#8208;forming structure from a human promoter. &#8220;Crystal Structure of an iM from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter&#8221;, K.

         <title>Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Geminal Cross Couplings of Dihaloalkanes with Cr Catalysis: Rapid Access to Tertiary and Quaternary Alkanes via a Metal&#8211;Carbene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable&#160;the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#160;cleavage of two&#160;geminal&#160;bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8211;C/C&#8211;Si or C&#8211;C/C&#8211;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada&#8208;type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C&#8211;halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8211;C and C&#8211;Si bonds via a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three&#8208;component geminal cross couplings are value&#8208;addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Porous Ionic Liquids for Coupling Natural Gas Purification with Waste Gas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry. We here report a type of porous ionic liquids (PILs) that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products. The PILs are synthesized through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step surface modification of ionic liquids (ILs) onto UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH nanocrystals. The introduction of free tertiary amine groups on the nanocrystal surface endows these PILs with an exceptional ability to enrich H2S from CO2 and CH4 with impressive selectivity, while the permanent pores of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH act as containers to store an exceptionally higher amount of the selectively captured H2S than the corresponding nonporous ILs. Simultaneously, the tertiary amines as dual functional moieties offer effective catalytic sites for the conversion of the H2S stored in PILs into 3&#8208;mercaptoisobutyric acid, a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Captopril (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations help understand both the mechanisms of separation and catalysis performance, confirming that the tertiary amines as well as the permanent pores in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH play vital roles in the whole procedure.</dc:description>

The introduction of free tertiary amine groups on the nanocrystal surface endows these PILs with an exceptional ability to enrich H2S from CO2 and CH4 with impressive selectivity, while the permanent pores of UiO-66-OH act as containers to store an exceptionally higher amount of the selectively captured H2S than the corresponding nonporous ILs. Simultaneously, the tertiary amines as dual functional moieties offer effective catalytic sites for the conversion of the H2S stored in PILs into 3-mercaptoisobutyric acid, a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Captopril (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations help understand both the mechanisms of separation and catalysis performance, confirming that the tertiary amines as well as the permanent pores in UiO-66-OH play vital roles in the whole procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Display Selection of a Hybrid Foldamer&#8208;Peptide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanding the chemical diversity of peptide macrocycle libraries for display selection is desirable to improve their potential at binding biomolecular targets. We now have implemented a considerable expansion through a large aromatic helical foldamer inclusion. A helical aromatic foldamer was identified that undergoes flexizyme&#8208;mediated tRNA acylation and is capable of initiating ribosomal translation with yields sufficiently high to perform an mRNA display selection of macrocyclic foldamer&#8208;peptide hybrids. A hybrid macrocyle nanomolar binder to the C&#8208;lobe of the E6AP HECT domain was selected that showed a highly converged peptide sequence. A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that both the peptide and foldamer are helical in an intriguing reciprocal stapling fashion. The strong residue convergence could be rationalized based on their involvement in specific interactions with the target protein. The foldamer stabilizes the peptide helix through stapling and through contacts with key residues. These results altogether represent a significant extension of the chemical space amenable to display selection and highlight possible benefits of inserting an aromatic foldamer into a peptide macrocycle for the purpose of protein recognition.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide complex with alkynes possessing boryl or silyl capping groups resulted in formation of unprecedented tetracopper(I) &#181;&#8208;acetylide/diyne complexes that were characterized by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These compounds possess an unusual &#181;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode for the bridging organic fragment, enforced by the rigid and dinucleating nature of the ligand utilized. Thus, the central &#960; system remains unperturbed and accessible for subsequent reactivity and modification. This has been corroborated by addition of a fifth copper atom, giving rise to a pentacopper acetylide complex. This work may provide a new approach by which metal&#8208;metal cooperativity can be exploited in the transformation of acetylide and diyne groups to a variety of substrates, or as a starting point for the controlled synthesis of copper(I) alkyne&#8208;containing clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete Peripheral Fluorination of the Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor in Organic Solar Cells Yields Efficiency over 19%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the intrinsically flexible molecular skeletons and loose aggregation, organic semiconductors, like small molecular acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), greatly suffer from larger structural/packing disorders and weaker intermolecular interactions comparing to their inorganic counterparts, further leading to hindered exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge carrier migration in resulting OSCs. To overcome this challenge, complete peripheral fluorination was performed on basis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series SMAs, rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding the molecular backbone. Benefitting from the broad 2D backbone, more importantly, strengthened fluorine&#8208;induced secondary interactions, CH8F and its D18 blends afford much enhanced and more ordered molecular packings accompanying with enlarged dielectric constants, reduced exciton binding energies and more obvious fibrillary networks comparing to CH6F controls. Consequently, D18:CH8F&#8208;based OSCs reached an excellent efficiency of 18.80%, much better than that of 17.91% for CH6F&#8208;based ones. More excitingly, by employing D18&#8208;Cl that possesses a highly similar structure to D18 as a third component, the highest efficiency of 19.28% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based OSCs has been achieved so far. Our work demonstrates the dramatical structural multiformity of CH&#8208;series SMAs, meanwhile, their high potential for constructing record&#8208;breaking OSCs through peripheral fine&#8208;tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small&#8208;molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report two novel three&#8208;dimensional copper&#8208;benzoquinoid metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu4L3]n and [Cu4L3&#183;Cu(iq)3]n (LH4 = 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahydroxybenzene, iq = isoquinoline). Spectroscopic techniques and computational studies reveal the unprecedented mixed valency in MOFs, formal Cu(I)/Cu(III). This is the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids. The coordination between the mixed&#8208;valence metal and redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent ligand L, which promotes through&#8208;bond charge transfer between Cu metal sites, allows better metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap of the d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, leading to strong long&#8208;range delocalization and semiconducting behavior.

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2&#160;Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emission and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We prove that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in&#8208;situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in&#8208;situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote formation of *OCHO intermediate, but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OHeq)2(OAcax)2]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long&#8208;circulating tumor&#8208;targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well. The complexes showed massively prolonged plasma half&#8208;life and distinctly improved anticancer activity in vivo compared to oxaliplatin. Taken together, the newly developed synthetic platform allows the simple and specific insertion of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes. This will enable the attachment of three different (bioactive) moieties generating targeted triple&#8208;action platinum(IV) prodrugs within one single platinum complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions between Polyvinyl Chloride and Conjugated Polymers Enable Excellent Mechanical Properties and High Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of insulating polymers into conjugated polymers has been widely explored as a strategy to improve mechanical properties of flexible organic electronics. However, phase separation due to the immiscibility of these polymers has limited their effectiveness. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel non&#8208;covalent interaction that enhances the miscibility between insulating and conjugated polymers, resulting in improved mechanical properties. Specifically, we added polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to the conjugated polymer PM6 and observed a significant increase in solution viscosity, indicative of favorable miscibility between the two polymers. This phenomenon has been rarely observed in other insulating/conjugated polymer composites. Thin films of PM6/PVC exhibited a much&#8208;improved crack&#8208;onset strain of 19.35%, compared to 10.12% for pristine PM6 films. Analysis revealed that a "cyclohexyl&#8208;like" structure formed through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVC and PM6 acted as a cross&#8208;linking site in the thin films, leading to improved mechanical properties. Moreover, PM6/PVC blend films demonstrated excellent thermal and bending stability when applied as an electron donor in organic solar cells. These findings provide new insights into non&#8208;covalent molecular interactions that can be utilized to enhance the properties of conjugated polymers and may have potential applications in flexible organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Delocalization Enables Sulfone&#8208;based Single&#8208;solvent Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMB), although providing high energy density, face the grand challenge of identifying good electrolyte solvents for cycling. Common solvents are either stable against lithium metal anode or stable against LiNixMnyCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. An example is the sulfone solvent. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the solvent electrons by introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li+. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMBs under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21 mg/cm2 NMC811 and 50 &#956;m Li) with 90% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Pb&#8208;Modified Ultrathin RuCu Nanoflowers for Active, Stable, and CO&#8208;resistant Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>blem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H2 to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru&#8208;based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO&#8208;resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of *H, strengthen *OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) suggest that Pb acted as oxygen&#8208;rich site to regulate the behavior of the linear CO adsorption. The optimized Pb1.04&#8208;Ru92Cu8/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10 A mgRu&#8208;1 and 5.55 mA cm&#8722;2, which are ~10 and ~31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru&#8208;based catalyst with high activity and strong CO&#8208;resistance for alkaline HOR, which may promote the fundamental researches on the rational design of functional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Prospects of Holey Two&#8208;dimensional Platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced electrocatalysts can enable the widespread implementation of clean energy technologies. This paper reviews an emerging class of electrocatalytic materials comprising holey two&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;group metal (h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGM) nanosheets, which are categorically challenging to synthesize but inherently rich in all the qualities necessary to counter the kinetic and thermodynamic challenges of an electrochemical conversion process with high catalytic efficiency and stability. Although the 2D anisotropic growth of typical nonlayered metal crystals has succeeded and partly improved their atom&#8208;utilization efficiency, regularly distributed in&#8208;planar porosity can further optimize three critical factors that govern efficient electrocatalysis process: mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reactivity. However, producing such advanced morphological features within h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGMs is difficult unless they are specially engineered using approaches such as templating or kinetic ramification during 2D growth or controlled etching of preformed 2D&#8208;PGM solids. Therefore, this review highlighting the successful fabrication of various porous PGM nanosheets and their electrocatalytic benefits involving smart nanoscale features could inspire next&#8208;generation scientific and technological innovations toward securing a sustainable energy future.</dc:description>

         <title>Eutectic&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte with the Enhanced Lithium Salt Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deployment of lithium metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries with polymer electrolytes has been recognized as a promising approach to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technologies. However, the practical application of the polymer electrolytes is currently constrained by various challenges, including low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrochemical window, and poor interface stability. To address these issues, a novel eutectic&#8208;based polymer electrolyte consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) is developed. The research results demonstrate that the interactions between SN and PEGMEA promote the dissociation of the lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) salt and increase the concentration of free Li+. The well&#8208;designed eutectic&#8208;based PAN1.2&#8208;SPE (PEGMEA: SN=1: 1.2 mass ratio) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.30 mS cm&#8208;1 at 30 &#176;C and superior interface stability with Li anode. The Li/Li symmetric cell based on PAN1.2&#8208;SPE enables long&#8208;term plating/stripping at 0.3 and 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, and the Li/ LiFePO4 cell achieves superior long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.3% after 1500 cycles). Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 pouch cells employing PAN1.2&#8208;SPE demonstrate excellent cycling and safety characteristics. This study presents a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes and promotes the practical application of high&#8208;stable lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Metal&#8208;Oxide Reducibility for Efficient C&#8208;H Bond Activation in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowing the structure of catalytically active species/phases and providing methods for their purposeful generation are two prerequisites for the design of catalysts with desired performance. Herein, we introduce a simple method for precise preparation of supported/bulk catalysts. It utilizes the ability of metal oxides to dissolve and to simultaneously precipitate during their treatment in an aqueous ammonia solution. Applying this method for a conventional VOx&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites was tuned simply by changing pH value of the solution. These sites affect the strength of V&#8208;O&#8208;Al bonds of isolated VOx species and thus the reducibility of the latter. This method is also applicable for controlling the reducibility of bulk catalysts as demonstrated for a CeO2&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 system. The application potential of the developed catalysts was confirmed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and in the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Our approach is extendable to the preparation of any metal oxide catalysts dissolvable in an ammonia solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Nanohoop Polymers based on Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalenes for Charge Storage in Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiaromatic dibenzopentalenes in nanohoop polymers invoke an intriguing interplay of linear vs. radial conjugation, depending on the electronic nature of the comomoner unit, and improved charge storage properties due to the presence of the nanohoops compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer.







Abstract
With their bent &#960;&#8208;systems, cyclic conjugation and inherent cavities, conjugated nanohoops are attractive for organic electronics applications. For ease of processing and morphological stability, an incorporation into polymers is desirable, but to date was hampered with few exceptions by synthetic difficulties. We herein present a unique strategy for the synthesis of conjugated nanohoop polymers using a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) as central connector. We demonstrate this versatility by synthesizing three electronically diverse copolymers with dithienyldiketo(pyrrolopyrrol), fluorene and carbazole comonomers, and report the first donor&#8208;acceptor nanohoop polymer. Optoelectronic investigations reveal the prevalence of cyclic or linear conjugation, depending on the comonomer unit, and ambipolar electrochemical properties through the antiaromatic character of the DBP units. As the first report on using conjugated nanohoops for charge storage as positive electrode materials, we show a significant improvement in battery performance in a nanohoop&#8208;containing polymer compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer. We believe this study will pave the way for the synthesis of a diverse range of nanohoop polymers and further stimulate their exploration for charge storage in batteries.

         <title>An S=1 Iron(IV) Intermediate Revealed in a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first non&#8208;heme enzymatic S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate is discovered via transient kinetics and spectroscopic (M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, and XANES) characterizations. This novel species is a key intermediate to enable the oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation in the biosynthesis of ovothiol&#8197;A.







Abstract
Ergothioneine (ESH) and ovothiol A (OSHA) are two natural thiol&#8208;histidine derivatives. ESH has been implicated as a longevity vitamin and OSHA inhibits the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma. The key biosynthetic step of ESH and OSHA in the aerobic pathways is the O2&#8208;dependent C&#8722;S bond formation catalyzed by non&#8208;heme iron enzymes (e.g., OvoA in ovothiol biosynthesis), but due to the lack of identification of key reactive intermediate the mechanism of this novel reaction is unresolved. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a kinetically competent S=1 iron(IV) intermediate supported by a four&#8208;histidine ligand environment (three from the protein residues and one from the substrate) in enabling C&#8722;S bond formation in OvoA from Methyloversatilis thermotoleran, which represents the first experimentally observed intermediate spin iron(IV) species in non&#8208;heme iron enzymes. Results reported in this study thus set the stage to further dissect the mechanism of enzymatic oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the OSHA biosynthesis pathway. They also afford new opportunities to study the structure&#8208;function relationship of high&#8208;valent iron intermediates supported by a histidine rich ligand environment.

         <title>Bimetallic Anionic Organic Frameworks with Solid&#8208;State Cation Conduction for Charge Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP metal&#8211;organic frameworks, comprising a cation&#8208;rich phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, exhibit a high cation content, possess two distinct binding sites (&#8722;O[Li/Na]A and &#8722;O[Li/Na]B) and reversible redox chemistry. These MOFs demonstrate solid&#8208;state conduction of Li+ and Na+ ions, making them the first reported MOFs with such properties.







Abstract
A new phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, with the general formula of A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP (wherein A is Li+ or Na+, and DOBDP6&#8722; is the 2,5&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediphosphate ligand) is prepared and characterized for energy storage applications. With four alkali cations per formula unit, the A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP MOF is found to be the first example of non&#8208;solvated cation conducting MOF with measured conductivities of 5.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8208; phases, indicating phase and composition effects of Li+ and Na+ shuttling through the channels. Three orders of magnitude increase in ionic conductivity is further attained upon solvation with propylene carbonate, placing this system among the best MOF ionic conductors at room temperature. As positive electrode material, Li4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP delivers a specific capacity of 140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high average discharge potential of 3.2&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) with 90&#8201;% of capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles. The significance of this research extends from the development of a new family of electroactive phosphonate&#8208;based MOFs with inherent ionic conductivity and reversible cation storage, to providing elementary insights into the development of highly sought yet still evasive MOFs with mixed&#8208;ion and electron conduction for energy storage applications.

         <title>Evading the Illusions: Identification of False Peaks in Micro&#8208;Raman Spectroscopy and Guidelines for Scientific Best Practice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy is a great analysis tool but the spectra are sometimes difficult to interpret due to the occurrence of spectral artefacts. This paper dives into the details of many spurious signals and spectral artefacts that occur in Raman spectra, explains their origin, and provides the tools to identify and avoid them.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;Raman spectroscopy is an important analytical tool in a large variety of science disciplines. The technique is suitable for both identification of chemical bonds and studying more detailed phenomena like molecular interactions, material strain, crystallinity, defects, and bond formations. Raman scattering has one major weakness however: it is a very low probability process. The weak signals require very sensitive detection systems, which leads to a high probability of picking up signals from origins other than the sample. This complicates the analysis of the results and increases the risk of misinterpreting data. This work provides an overview of the sources of spurious signals occurring in Raman spectra, including photoluminescence, cosmic rays, stray light, artefacts caused by spectrometer components, and signals from other compounds in or surrounding the sample. The origins of these false Raman peaks are explained and means to identify and counteract them are provided.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Effect in a Covalent&#8211;Organic Framework with Imidazole Groups Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic media is irrepressible. Here, we report an imidazole&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst, which exhibits a better performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in an acidic electrolyte than a neutral electrolyte.







Abstract
Solvent effect plays an important role in catalytic reaction, but there is little research and attention on it in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, we report a stable covalent&#8208;organic framework (denoted as PcNi&#8208;im) with imidazole groups as a new electrocatalyst for eCO2RR to CO. Interestingly, compared with neutral conditions, PcNi&#8208;im not only showed high Faraday efficiency of CO product (&#8776;100&#8201;%) under acidic conditions (pH &#8776; 1), but also the partial current density was increased from 258 to 320&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. No obvious degradation was observed over 10&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The mechanism study shows that the imidazole group on the framework can be protonated to form an imidazole cation in acidic media, hence reducing the surface work function and charge density of the active metal center. As a result, CO poisoning effect is weakened and the key intermediate *COOH is also stabilized, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction rate.

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Decarboxylative Olefination Driven by Alternating Polarity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical conversion of unactivated carboxylic acids to olefins under alternating polarity is reported. By modulating electrode surface quality and local acidity, chemoselective Hofer&#8208;Moest reactivity is realized on conventionally difficult substrates, including primary and secondary unactivated carboxylic acids. This simple protocol is exceptionally scalable (1&#8197;kg) and cost&#8208;effective.







Abstract
A mild, scalable (kg) metal&#8208;free electrochemical decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to olefins is disclosed. Numerous applications are presented wherein this transformation can simplify alkene synthesis and provide alternative synthetic access to valuable olefins from simple carboxylic acid feedstocks. This robust method relies on alternating polarity to maintain the quality of the electrode surface and local pH, providing a deeper understanding of the Hofer&#8208;Moest process with unprecedented chemoselectivity.

         <title>Analysis of Rhizonin Biosynthesis Reveals Origin of Pharmacophoric Furylalanine Moieties in Diverse Cyclopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic origin of rhizonins, hepatotoxic cyclopeptides with unusual 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, has been elucidated. Functional analysis of the biosynthesis gene cluster, labeling experiments, and heterologous reconstitution revealed the biosynthetic precursors and a novel dioxygenase (RhzB) that catalyzes Fua formation and allowed the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster by genome mining.







Abstract
Rhizonin A and B are hepatotoxic cyclopeptides produced by bacterial endosymbionts (Mycetohabitans endofungorum) of the fungus Rhizopus microsporus. Their toxicity critically depends on the presence of 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, which also occur in pharmaceutically relevant cyclopeptides of the endolide and bingchamide families. The biosynthesis and incorporation of Fua by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), however, has remained elusive. By genome sequencing and gene inactivation we elucidated the gene cluster responsible for rhizonin biosynthesis. A suite of isotope labeling experiments identified tyrosine and l&#8208;DOPA as Fua precursors and provided the first mechanistic insight. Bioinformatics, mutational analysis and heterologous reconstitution identified dioxygenase RhzB as necessary and sufficient for Fua formation. RhzB is a novel type of heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenases (HDAO) that enabled the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster through genome mining.

         <title>Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Chemical Regulation of Reactive X Species for Versatile Disease Treatments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides a summary of the chemistry and mechanisms governing reactive species (RXS) based nanomedicine, focusing on metabolic regulation, the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination. The challenges and future prospects associated with RXS for disease treatments are further discussed, aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of RXS&#8208;based nanomedicine and open new avenues for improved therapeutic interventions.







Abstract
Reactive X species (RXS), encompassing elements such as O, N, C, S, Se, Cl, Br, I, and H, play vital roles in cell biology and physiological function, impacting cellular signal transduction, metabolic regulation, and disease processes. The redox unbalance of RXS is firmly implicated in an assortment of physiological and pathological disorders, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the intricate nature and multifactorial dependence of RXS pose challenges in comprehending and precisely modulating their biological behavior. Nanomaterials with distinct characteristics and biofunctions offer promising avenues for generating or scavenging RXS to maintain redox homeostasis and advance disease therapy. This minireview provides a tutorial summary of the relevant chemistry and specific mechanisms governing different RXS, focusing on cellular metabolic regulation, stress responses, and the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination. The challenges associated with chemically regulating RXS for diverse disease treatments are further discussed along with the future prospects, aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of RXS&#8208;based nanomedicine and open new avenues for improved therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Nucleophilic Carbenes Derived from Dichloromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalysts promote cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane as a methylene source. An asymmetric variant using a chiral pyridine&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand provides access to pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aryl cyclopropyl carboxylates in highly enantioenriched form. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of a nucleophilic nickel carbene that reacts by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination pathway.







Abstract
Nickel PyBox catalysts promote nucleophilic cyclopropanation reactions using CH2Cl2 as a methylene source and Mn as a stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope includes a broad range of alkenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, including esters, amides, ketones, nitriles, sulfones, phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl groups, and electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Enantioselective cyclopropanations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters have been developed using chiral PyBox ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a (PyBox)Ni=CH2 species, which adds to the alkene by a stepwise [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination mechanism. DFT models provide a rationale for the nucleophilic character of the nickel carbene and the sense of enantioinduction.

         <title>NADH Photosynthesis System with Affordable Electron Supply and Inhibited NADH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

An innovative NADH photosynthesis system is developed, in which the oxidation of biomass derivatives is used as an electron supply module (ESM) to supply electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is used as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Benefiting from the inhibition of REM, the NADH photosynthesis system exhibits a two&#8208;fold enhancement in the NADH yield compared with the system without REM.







Abstract
Photosynthesis offers a green approach for the recycling of nicotinamide cofactors primarily NADH in bio&#8208;redox reactions. Herein, we report an NADH photosynthesis system where the oxidation of biomass derivatives is designed as an electron supply module (ESM) to afford electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is designed as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Glucose as the electron donor guarantees the reaction sustainability accompanied with oxidative products of gluconic acid and formic acid. Meanwhile, enzyme cascades of SOD/CAT greatly eliminate ROS, leading to a &#8776;2.00&#8208;fold elevation of NADH yield (61.1&#8201;% vs. 30.7&#8201;%). The initial reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOF) increased by 2.50&#8197;times and 2.54&#8197;times, respectively, compared with those systems without REM. Our study establishes a novel and efficient platform for NADH photosynthesis coupled to biomass&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach for the synthesis of hierarchical biomaterials. Hence,it is essential to directly observe the assembly dynamics and structural evolution using in situ characterization approaches. These measurements reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism for improving the accuracy of biomaterials design.







Abstract
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly of hierarchical materials is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach to synthesizing across scales with considerable energy, health, environment, sustainability, and information technology applications. To achieve desired functions in biomaterials, it is essential to directly observe assembly dynamics and structural evolutions that reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism. This review will summarize the current understanding of biomolecular assembly mechanisms based on in situ characterization and discuss the broader significance and achievements of newly gained insights. In addition, we will also introduce how emerging deep learning/machine learning&#8208;based approaches, multiparametric characterization, and high&#8208;throughput methods can boost the development of biomolecular self&#8208;assembly. The objective of this review is to accelerate the development of in situ characterization approaches for biomolecular self&#8208;assembly and to inspire the next generation of biomimetic materials.

         <title>Modulating Ligand&#8208;Exchange Dynamics on Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Reversible Sorting and Hybridization of Miktoarm Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra possess logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics that can only be activated at high temperatures. They have been applied as crosslinker templates for the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers with target compositions by thermal annealing of the mixture of star homo&#8208;polymers. The reversible sorting process can be conducted through a typical solvent extraction procedure.







Abstract
The precise synthesis of miktoarm star polymers (MSPs) remains one of the great challenges in synthetic chemistry due to the difficulty in locating appropriate structural templates and polymer grafting/growing strategies with high selectivity and efficiency. Herein, &#8776;2&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed from the coordination of isophthalic acid (IPA) and Cu2+, are applied as templates for the precise synthesis of 24&#8208;arm MSPs for their unique logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics. Six different polymers are prepared with IPA as an end group and they further coordinated with Cu2+ to afford the corresponding 24&#8208;arm star homo&#8208;polymers. MSPs can be obtained by mixing targeted homo&#8208;arm star polymers in solutions upon thermal annealing. The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned by the recipe of the star polymer mixtures used. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo&#8208;arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction procedure. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted through the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.

We report a rare polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction displays broad scope with mechanistic investigations supporting a unique synergistic activation pathway that displays chemoselectivity for styrene boronic acids in the presence of other SOMOphiles. SOMO=singly occupied molecular orbital.







Abstract
We report the development of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through an unusual polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition mechanism that is orthogonal to established processes. Synergistic activation of the radical precursor and organoboron are critical mechanistic events. Activation of an N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester by coordination to boron enables electron transfer, with decomposition leading to a nucleofuge rebound, activating the organoboron to radical addition. The unique mechanism enables chemoselective coupling of styrene boronic acids in the presence of other alkene radical acceptors. The scope and limitations of the reaction, and a detailed mechanistic investigation are presented.

         <title>An RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzyme That Requires an Organic Solvent to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme was derived from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool by forcing the sequences to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent in aqueous solution. The DNAzyme was isolated via a counter&#8208;selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by a positive selection in the same buffered solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO, and its activity was shown to be dependent on the presence of the cosolvent.







Abstract
Engineering functional nucleic acids that are active under unusual conditions will not only reveal their hidden abilities but also lay the groundwork for pursuing them for unique applications. Although many DNAzymes have been derived to catalyze diverse chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, no prior study has been set up to purposely derive DNAzymes that require an organic solvent to function. Herein, we utilized in vitro selection to isolate RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool that were &#8220;compelled&#8221; to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent, via counter selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by positive selection in the same solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO. This experiment led to the discovery of a new DNAzyme that requires 35&#8201;% DMSO for its catalytic activity and exhibits drastically reduced activity without DMSO. This DNAzyme also requires divalent metal ions for catalysis, and its activity is enhanced by monovalent ions. A minimized, more efficient DNAzyme was also derived. This work demonstrates that highly functional, organic solvent&#8208;dependent DNAzymes can be isolated from random&#8208;sequence DNA libraries via forced in vitro selection, thus expanding the capability and potential utility of catalytic DNA.

         <title>Flexible, Miniaturized Sensing Probes Inspired by Biofuel Cells for Monitoring Synaptically Released Glutamate in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by the structure and working principle of biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting devices have the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of structural and functional maladaptive changes in neural circuits after a variety of CNS trauma and diseases.







Abstract
Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50&#8197;&#956;m, can detect real&#8208;time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by the structure and working principle of biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting devices have the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of structural and functional maladaptive changes in neural circuits after a variety of CNS trauma and diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50&#8197;&#956;m, can detect real-time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices. These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Low&#8208;Valence Single Atoms by Constructing Metalloid Tungsten Carbide Supports for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence single&#8208;atom sites are induced and stabilized by constructing a metalloid tungsten carbide support (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd), leading to the realization of superior mass activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Designing novel single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supports to modulate the electronic structure is crucial to optimize the catalytic activity, but rather challenging. Herein, a general strategy is proposed to utilize the metalloid properties of supports to trap and stabilize single&#8208;atoms with low&#8208;valence states. A series of single&#8208;atoms supported on the surface of tungsten carbide (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a facile pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WCx, the single&#8208;atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low&#8208;valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal&#8208;metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low&#8208;valence single atoms on the WCx surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru&#8208;WCx exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively. In&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis demonstrates that an ideal dual&#8208;sites cooperative mechanism achieves a suitable adsorption balance of Had and OHad, resulting in an energetically favorable Volmer step. This work offers new guidance for the precise construction of highly active SACs.

         <title>Manganese/Cobalt Bimetallic Relay Catalysis for Divergent Dehydrogenative Difluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for the divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products were concisely constructed.







Abstract
The involvement of manganese radical for halogen atom transfer (XAT) reactions has been esteemed as one reliable method but encountered with limited catalytic models. In this paper, a novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse terminal, cyclic and internal alkenes as well as tetrasubstituted alkenes are found to be good coupling partners to deliver difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products, accompanied with the production of H2 as the by&#8208;product. This bimetallic relay strategy features broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility. Its success represents an important step&#8208;forward to expedite the construction of a rich library of difluoroalkylated products.

         <title>Hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Anisotropic Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)&#8208;dioxin linked covalent organic framework, denoted as HD&#8208;COF, was designed, and synthesized. The unique &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages in the HD&#8208;COF structure led to efficient anisotropic charge transport. In situ formed HD&#8208;COF film demonstrated enhanced electric conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with magic blue.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with efficient charge transport is of immense interest for applications in optoelectronic devices. To enhance COF charge transport properties, electroactive building blocks and dopants can be used to induce extended conduction channels. However, understanding their intricate interplay remains challenging. We designed and synthesized a tailor&#8208;made COF structure with electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) core units and planar dioxin (D) linkages, denoted as HD&#8208;COF. With the support of theoretical calculations, we found that the HAT units in the HD&#8208;COF induce strong, eclipsed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The unique stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages leads to efficient anisotropic charge transport. We fabricated HD&#8208;COF films to minimize the grain boundary effect of bulk COFs, which resulted in enhanced conductivity. As a result, the HD&#8208;COF films showed an electrical conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate.

Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach was proposed to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows with integrated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties.

Herein, we present a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows (MBs) that integrate 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties. By introducing ring strain into MBs through tethering the bow limb, we can harness the intrinsic mechanical forces to drive multistep aryl shifts from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208; to the ortho&#8208;position. Through the use of precise intramolecular strain, the seemingly impractical [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift was realized, resulting in the formation of ortho&#8208;disubstituted products. The solvent and temperature play a crucial role in the occurrence of the [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. The free energy calculations with inclusion of solvation support a feasible mechanism, which entails multistep carbocation rearrangements, for the formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. By exploring the application of molecular strain in synthetic chemistry, this research offers a promising direction for developing new tools and strategies towards precision organic synthesis.

         <title>Enhanced Li+ Diffusion and Lattice oxygen Stability by the High Entropy Effect in Disordered&#8208;Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy strategy improves the Li+ diffusion and oxygen lattice stability of the Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalts cathode during charging, and enables multiple 3d TM to participate in charge compensation cooperatively, resulting in better cycling retention and higher reversible capacity.







Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalt oxides (DRXs) are a promising new class of cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their natural abundance, low cost and great electrochemical performance. High entropy strategy in Mn&#8208;based DRXs appears to be an effective strategy for improving the rate capability, but it suffers from challenges including capacity degradation. The present paper reports a new group of high entropy DRXs (HE DRX) based on Ni2+&#8208;Nb5+ pair; the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of DRXs with an increasing transition metal (TM) species are systematically investigated. An explanation is proposed for how the crystal field stability energy determines that HE DRX could exist in single Rocksalt solid solution structures. We further reveal that the charge compensation mechanism in HE DRX is the result of various TM synergistic effect. More importantly, through various in situ and ex situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the effective integration of more TM cation species within the HE DRX framework promotes better Li+ diffusion and improves lattice oxygen stability, consequently increasing capacity upon cycling.

         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrated the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction is revealed to take place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron type nucleophilic substitution&#8208;triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional group compatibility. A mechanism involving aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis is at the verge of emerging as the method of choice for the generation and visualization of unstable or unconventional molecules, which could not be obtained via traditional synthetic methods. A case in point is the on&#8208;surface synthesis of the structurally elusive cyclotriphosphazene (P3N3), an inorganic aromatic analogue of benzene. Here, we report the preparation of this fleetingly existing species on Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces at 5.2 K through molecu&#173;lar manipulation with unprecedented precision, i.e., voltage pulse&#8208;induced sextuple dechlorina&#173;tion of an ultra&#8208;small (about 6 &#197;) hexachlorophosphazene P3N3Cl6&#160;molecule by the tip of a scan&#173;ning probe microscope. Real&#8208;space atomic&#8208;level imaging of cyclotriphosphazene reveals its planar&#160;D3h&#8208;symmetric ring structure. Furthermore, this demasking strategy has been expanded to generate cyclotriphosphazene from a hexaazide precursor P3N21&#160;via a different stimulation method (photolysis) for complementary measurements baby matrix isolation infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy Toward pH&#8208;Resistant Phenolic Fluorophores for High&#8208;Fidelity Sensing and Bioimaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl alcohol&#8208;type or phenolic fluorophores offer diverse opportunities for developing bioimaging agents and fluorescence probes. Due to the inherently acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH&#8208;dependent emission signals. Therefore, except for developing pH probes, the pH&#8208;dependent nature of phenolic fluorophores should be considered in bioimaging applications but has been neglected. Here we show that a simple structural remedy converts conventional phenolic fluorophores into pH&#8208;resistant derivatives, which also offer &#8220;medium&#8208;resistant&#8221; emission properties. The structural modification involves a single&#8208;step introduction of a hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor such as morpholine nearby the phenolic hydroxyl group, which also leads to emission bathochromic shift, increased Stokes shift, enhanced photo&#8208;stability and stronger emission for several dyes. The strategy greatly expands the current fluorophores&#8217; repertoire for reliable bioimaging applications, as demonstrated here with ratiometric imaging of cells and tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost the Electrocatalytic Water Splitting&#160; of Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a Ni3N/NiO Heterojunction at Industrial Current&#160;Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and stable hydrogen production catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (EWS) at industrial current densities remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a heterostructure&#8208;induced&#8208;strategy to optimize the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) and the EWS activity of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO. Density function theory (DFT) calculations firstly predicted that the Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures can improve the structural stability, electronic distributions, and orbital coupling of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO, compared to Ru&#8208;Ni3N and Ru&#8208;NiO, which accordingly decreases energy barriers and increases the electroactivity for EWS. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO catalyst with 2D Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures nanosheet array, uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, and strong MSI, was successfully constructed in the experiment, which owns an excellent HER and OER activity with overpotentials of 190 mV and 385 mV at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO&#8208;based EWS device can realize an industrial current density (1000 mA cm&#8722;2) at 1.74 V and 1.80 V under alkaline pure water and seawater conditions, respectively. Additionally, it also achieves a high durability of 1000 h (@ 500 mA cm&#8722;2) in alkaline pure water.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapidly synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis toward Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently faces mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;beared porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi&#8208;in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediates binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9% at 800 mA cm&#8722;2, superior to those in traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE high to 41.1% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here disclose that the incorporation of thiophene rings into a seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine in a fused fashion produces a useful antiaromatic core for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. In contrast to dibenzazepine derivatives with bent structures, dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives with electron&#8208;accepting groups adopt flat conformations in the ground state. The dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives exhibited broad absorption spectra that cover the visible region as well as sharp emission bands in the NIR region, which are considerably red&#8208;shifted relative to those of the dibenzo&#8208;fused congeners. Theoretical study revealed two contradictory effects of the less&#8208;aromatic thiophene&#8208;fused structure, i.e., the enhancement of the antiaromaticity of the adjacent azepine ring and the relief of the antiaromaticity through the contribution of a quinoidal resonance form. The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron&#8208;accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878 nm in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions. &#65279;Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro&#8208;environment to provide stronger interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for ternary mixtures, affording one of the highest C2H4 productivity of 1.35 mmol g&#8722;1. This material is highly stable and can be easily synthesized at kilogram&#8208;scale from cheap raw materials using a water&#8208;based green synthesis. The benchmark combination of excellent separation properties with high stability and low cost in scalable MOF&#8208;303 has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct selectivity control in solar&#8208;driven bio&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acid conversion: a comparison of Pt nanoparticles and atomically dispersed Pt on CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic lignocellulose conversion is a promising strategy for the sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals, but selectivity control remains a challenging goal in this field. Here, we report efficient and selective conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids to tartaric acid derivatives, &#945;&#8208;keto acids, and H2 using Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. Pt nanoparticles on CdS selectively produce tartaric acid derivatives via C&#8208;C coupling, while atomically dispersed Pt on CdS switches product selectivity to oxidation reaction to produce &#945;&#8208;keto acids. The atomically dispersed Pt species stabilized by Pt&#8208;S bonds promote the activation of hydroxyl group and thus switch product selectivity from tartaric acid derivatives to &#945;&#8208;keto acids. A broad range of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids was applied for preparing the corresponding tartaric acid derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids over the two Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. This work highlights the unique performance of metal sulfides in coupling reactions and demonstrates a strategy for rationally tuning product selectivity by engineering the interaction between metal sulfide and cocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Assembly of Cu Nanoclusters with Enhanced Electrochemcial Excitation and Radiative Transition for Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper   nanoclusters (CuNCs) are emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters with unique molecule&#8208;like electronic structures, high abundance, and low cost. However, the synthesis of CuNCs with high ECL efficiency and stability in a scalable manner remains challenging. Here, we report a facile gram&#8208;scale approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled CuNCs (CuNCsAssy) induced by ligands with exceptionally boosted anodic ECL and stability. Compared to the disordered aggregates that are inactive in ECL, the CuNCsAssy shows a record anodic ECL efficiency for CuNCs (10%, wavelength&#8208;corrected, relative to Ru(bpy)3Cl2/tripropylamine). Mechanism studies revealed the unusual dual functions of ligands in simultaneously facilitating electrochemical excitation and radiative transition. Moreover, the assembly addressed the limitation of poor stability of conventional CuNCs. As a proof of concept, an ECL biosensor for alkaline phosphatase detection was successfully constructed with an ultralow limit of detection of 8.1&#215;10&#8208;6 U/L.</dc:description>

         <title>Sabatier Relations in Electrocatalysts Based on High&#8208;entropy Alloys with Wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band Centers for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li&#8208;ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457 Wh kg&#8208;1), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas&#8208;solid reaction between O2 and Li2O2. Despite many catalysts are developed for accelerating the conversion process, the lack of design guidance for achieving high performance makes catalysts exploring aleatory. The Sabatier principle is an acknowledged theory connecting the scaling relationship with heterogenous catalytic activity, providing a tradeoff strategy for the topmost performance. Herein, a series of catalysts with wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers (i.e., wide range of adsorption strength) are elaborately constructed via high&#8208;entropy strategy, enabling an in&#8208;depth study of the Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for LOBs. A volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity emerges. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a moderate d&#8208;band center with appropriate adsorption strength propels the catalysts up to the top. As a demonstration of concept, the LOB using FeCoNiMnPtIr as catalyst provides an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of over 80%, and works steadily for 2000 h with a high fixed specific capacity of 4000 mAh g&#8208;1. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle as a guidance for designing advanced heterogenous catalysts assembled in LOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;encapsulating Cofactor and Enzymes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Multienzyme Cascade Reactions with Cofactor Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach that confines a cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is presented. The system features excellent cargo loading, cascade activity recovery, and cofactor recycling capabilities. The success of the approach depends on the polyelectrolyte interacting with the HOF monomers in place of enzymes and anchoring cofactors and enzymes within the HOFs.







Abstract
Use of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for enzyme immobilization faces challenges in the improvement of enzyme activity recovery and the assembly of cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme systems. Herein, we report a polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach (PAEA) that enables two cascades with four oxidoreductases and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) cofactors co&#8208;encapsulated in BioHOF&#8208;1 with excellent cargo loading and over 100&#8201;% cascade activity. The key role of the polyelectrolyte is to coat enzymes and tether NAD(P)H, thus interacting with HOF monomers in place of enzymes, avoiding the destruction of enzymes by HOF monomers. The versatility and efficiency of PAEA are further illustrated by an HOF&#8208;101&#8208;based bio&#8208;nanoreactor. Moreover, the immobilization by PAEA makes enzymes and NAD(P)H display excellent stability and recyclability. This study has demonstrated a facile and versatile PAEA for fabricating cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade nanoreactors with HOFs.

         <title>Electrochemical Nanoreactor Provides a Comprehensive View of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Cancer&#8208;drug Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transducing the tightly&#8208;channeled catalytic activity of &#8220;nanoconfined&#8221; enzyme cascades into electrical current affords a powerful and novel way to observe specific enzyme reactions, directly and in real time. Here, the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221; is used to extract detailed kinetic and mechanistic information on the inhibitory action of a high&#8208;profile cancer drug that inhibits a common cancer&#8208;associated variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).







Abstract
The ability to control enzyme cascades entrapped in a nanoporous electrode material (the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221;, e&#8208;Leaf) has been exploited to gain detailed kinetic insight into the mechanism of an anti&#8208;cancer drug. Ivosidenib, used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, acts on a common cancer&#8208;linked variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1 R132H) inhibiting its &#8220;gain&#8208;of&#8208;function&#8221; activity&#8212;the undesired reduction of 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) to the oncometabolite 2&#8208;hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The e&#8208;Leaf quantifies the kinetics of IDH1 R132H inhibition across a wide and continuous range of conditions, efficiently revealing factors underlying the inhibitor residence time. Selective inhibition of IDH1 R132H by Ivosidenib and another inhibitor, Novartis 224, is readily resolved as a two&#8208;stage process whereby initial rapid non&#8208;inhibitory binding is followed by a slower step to give the inhibitory complex. These kinetic features are likely present in other allosteric inhibitors of IDH1/2. Such details, essential for understanding inhibition mechanisms, are not readily resolved in conventional steady&#8208;state kinetics or by techniques that rely only on measuring binding. Extending the new method and analytical framework presented here to other enzyme systems will be straightforward and should rapidly reveal insight that is difficult or often impossible to obtain using other methods.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation Allows Protecting Group&#8208;Free and Stereoselective O&#8208;Glycosylation of Carboxylic Acids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids was reported. This transformation, which employs bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities.







Abstract
Here we report a simple and general method to achieve fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids, employing bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities. Both the donor activation stage and the glycosidic bond forming stage of the process are compatible with free hydroxyl groups, thereby allowing for the use of fully unprotected glycosyl donors. This transformation is stereoconvergent, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions at ambient temperature with visible light (455&#8197;nm) irradiation, and displays remarkable scope with respect to both reaction partners. Many natural products and commercial drugs, including an acid derived from the complex anticancer agent taxol, were efficiently glycosylated. Experimental studies provide insights into the origin of the stereochemical outcome.

This transformation is stereoconvergent, occurs under mild and metal-free conditions at ambient temperature with visible light (455&#8197;nm) irradiation, and displays remarkable scope with respect to both reaction partners. Many natural products and commercial drugs, including an acid derived from the complex anticancer agent taxol, were efficiently glycosylated. Experimental studies provide insights into the origin of the stereochemical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Along the Nonpolar Axis in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
So far, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has been discussed based on the classical explanation that photocurrent originates from macroscopic polarization. Herein, we report the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs. The light polarization dependence is consistent with the shift current mechanism, which possesses effective features, such as ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature.







Abstract
The origin of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was considered as a built&#8208;in electric field formed by the macroscopic polarization of materials. Alternatively, the &#8220;shift current mechanism&#8221; has been gradually accepted as the more appropriate description of the BPVE. This mechanism implies that the photocurrent generated by the BPVE is a topological current featuring an ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature, which is very attractive for photodetector applications. Meanwhile, the origin of the BPVE in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has not been discussed and is still widely accepted as the classical mechanism without any experimental evidence. Herein, we observed the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs, which is inconsistent with the classical explanation. Furthermore, based on the nonlinear optical tensor correlation, we substantiated that the BPVE in OIHPs is originated in the shift current mechanism.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of the Ser&#8208;Phosphorylation Pattern on the DNA&#8208;Binding Activity of Max Transcription Factor Using Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared by a practical strategy to probe the impact of Ser phosphorylation. The phosphorylation pattern was found to play a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but did not significant affect sequence specificity. The insight gained on the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation sheds light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful method to investigate how post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) influence TF&#8208;DNA interactions and impact gene expression. Among these TFs, Max plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of 15&#8201;% of the genome. The activity of Max is regulated by PTMs; Ser&#8208;phosphorylation at the N&#8208;terminus is considered one of the key regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we developed a practical synthetic strategy to prepare homogeneous full&#8208;length Max for the first time, to explore the impact of Max phosphorylation. We prepared a focused library of eight Max variants, with distinct modification patterns, including mono&#8208;phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated analogues at Ser2/Ser11 as well as fluorescently labeled variants through native chemical ligation. Through comprehensive DNA binding analyses, we discovered that the phosphorylation position plays a crucial role in the DNA&#8208;binding activity of Max. Furthermore, in vitro high&#8208;throughput analysis using DNA microarrays revealed that the N&#8208;terminus phosphorylation pattern does not interfere with the DNA sequence specificity of Max. Our work provides insights into the regulatory role of Max&#8242;s phosphorylation on the DNA interactions and sequence specificity, shedding light on how PTMs influence TF function.

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H Amidation for the Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A camphorsulfonic acid&#8208;based directing group was designed for the Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, allowing the synthesis of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic studies provided insights into the matched/mismatched effect observed in the C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines.







Abstract
Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo&#8208;protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2&#8208;diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents. It was found applicable to both &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, for which a two&#8208;step protocol involving intermolecular olefin hydroamination and C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation was developed. Kinetic and computational studies provided insights into the observed reactivity difference between pairs of diastereoisomeric substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of C60/[10]CPP&#8208;Catenanes by Regioselective, Nanocapsule&#8208;Templated Bingel Bis&#8208;Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of three approaches (tether, nanohoop template &amp; supramolecular shadow mask) enabled the itero&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of [2]catenanes via bis&#8208;addition of bis&#8208;bromomalonates to the complex C60&#8834;[10]CPP. The use of a &#8220;traceless&#8221; nanocapsule shadow mask was key for obtaining 87&#8201;% selectivity for the &#8220;in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242; product, where the formation of a total of 22 isomers is theoretically possible.







Abstract
The addition of two unsymmetric malonate esters to the Buckminster fullerene C60 can lead to 22 spectroscopically distinguishable isomeric products and therefore represents a formidable synthesis challenge. In this work, we achieve 87&#8201;% selectivity for the formation of a single (in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3) isomer by combining three approaches: (i) we use a starting material, in which the two malonates are covalently connected (tether approach); (ii) we form the strong supramolecular complex of C60 with the shape&#8208;persistent [10]CPP macrocycle (template approach) and (iii) we embed this complex further within a self&#8208;assembled nanocapsule (shadow mask approach). Variation of the spacer chain shed light on the limitations of the approach and the ring dynamics in the unusual [2]catenanes were studied in silico with atomistic resolution. This work significantly widens the scope of mechanically interlocked architectures comprising cycloparaphenylenes (CPP).

         <title>Selectivity Control in the Direct CO Esterification over Pd@UiO&#8208;66: The Pd Location Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Pd nanoparticles into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibits high selectivity for dimethyl carbonate (DMC), while Pd nanoparticles on MOFs and other supports give high selectivity for dimethyl oxalate (DMO) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite. The Lewis acid microenvironment surrounding Pd NPs is responsible for the reversed product selectivity.







Abstract
The selectivity control of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite toward dimethyl oxalate (DMO) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC) remains a grand challenge. Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X=&#8208;H, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;NH2), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO&#8208;66, displays high selectivity (89&#8201;%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.

&lt;p&gt;The selectivity control of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite toward dimethyl oxalate (DMO) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC) remains a grand challenge. Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO-66-X (X=-H, -NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), affording Pd@UiO-66-X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO-66, displays high selectivity (89&#8201;%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO-66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr-oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO-66 and Pd/UiO-66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flux&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Y2Ti2O5S2 for Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) were synthesized in a flux environment. Significantly reduced particle sizes and enhanced photocatalytic performance were observed, indicating the utility of flux&#8208;assisted methods in the preparation of oxysulfide photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is an ideal means of producing hydrogen in a sustainable manner, and developing highly efficient photocatalysts is a vital aspect of realizing this process. The photocatalyst Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) is capable of absorbing at wavelengths up to 650&#8197;nm and exhibits outstanding thermal and chemical durability compared with other oxysulfides. However, the photocatalytic performance of YTOS synthesized using the conventional solid&#8208;state reaction (SSR) process is limited owing to the large particle sizes and structural defects associated with this synthetic method. Herein, we report the synthesis of YTOS particles by a flux&#8208;assisted technique. The enhanced mass transfer efficiency in the flux significantly reduced the preparation time compared with the SSR method. In addition, the resulting YTOS showed improved photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution activity when loaded with Rh and Co3O4 co&#8208;catalysts, respectively. These improvements are attributed to the reduced particle size and enhanced crystallinity of the material as well as the slower decay of photogenerated carriers on a nanosecond to sub&#8208;microsecond time range. Further optimization of this flux&#8208;assisted method together with suitable surface modification is expected to produce high&#8208;quality YTOS crystals with superior photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Absolute CO2/Xenon Separation in Ultramicropore MOF for Anesthetic Gases Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery device is highly needed to guarantee sufficient supply for clinical anesthetic purposes. Herein, an innovative way to recover Xe in exhaled anesthetic gases by using hydrolytically stable NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni MOF is reported. The unprecedented CO2/Xe selectivity (825) of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery in exhaled gases, making it an ideal adsorbent for actual Xe anesthesia gas regeneration.







Abstract
Xe is an ideal anesthetic gas, but it has not been widely used in practice due to its high cost and low output. Closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling is an economically viable method to ensure adequate supply in medical use. Herein, we design an innovative way to recover Xe by using a stable fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni to eliminate CO2 from moist exhaled anesthetic gases. Unlike other Xe recovery MOFs with low Xe/CO2 selectivity (less than 10), NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve absolute molecular sieve separation of CO2/Xe with excellent CO2 selectivity (825). Mixed&#8208;gas breakthrough experiments assert the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni as a molecular sieve adsorbent for the effective and energy&#8208;efficient removal of carbon dioxide with 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery. Absolute CO2/Xe separation in NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni makes closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling can be easily realized, demonstrating the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni for important anesthetic gas regeneration under ambient conditions.

         <title>Supramolecular Memristor Based on Bistable [2]Catenanes: Toward High&#8208;Density and Non&#8208;Volatile Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular memristors have been successfully fabricated through the introduction of a bistable [2]catenane, which can stablize charge injection effciently. The AuTS&#8208;S&#8208;C3&#8208;SO3&#8722;Na+//[2]catenane//Ga2O3/EGaIn junctions serve as both resistive switches and diodes. The non&#8208;volatile memristors undergo repeated switching cycles of over 1000&#8197;times and a retention time exceeding 500&#8197;seconds under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for data storage and neuromorphic computing calls for innovative, high&#8208;density solutions, such as resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM). However, the integration of resistive switching and rectification at the nanoscale remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we introduce a bistable [2]catenane&#8208;based supramolecular junction that simultaneously functions as a resistive switch and a diode. All supramolecular junctions are highly stable and reproducible over thousands of resistive switching cycles, because the nano&#8208;confinement of two mechanically interlocked rings can stabilize the radical states of pyridinium moieties under ambient conditions. The successful realization of supramolecular junctions in functionality with a thickness of approximately 2&#8197;nm presents a promising avenue for the development of molecule&#8208;scale based RRAM for a better solution to high density and energy efficiency.

         <title>Combinatorial Screening of Water/Proton Permeation of Self&#8208;Assembled Pillar[5]arene Artificial Water Channel Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary combinations of pillararenes libraries have been used to construct selective artificial water channels that present increased water transport activities across lipid bilayers compared to their components A&#8211;D. These channels are capable of transporting water at a rate that is one order of magnitude below that of the natural aquaporins.







Abstract
Artificial water channels (AWCs) that selectively transport water and reject ions through bilayer membranes have potential to act as synthetic Aquaporins (AQPs). AWCs can have a similar osmotic permeability, better stability, with simpler manufacture on a larger&#8208;scale and have higher functional density and surface permeability when inserted into the membrane. Here, we report the screening of combinatorial libraries of symmetrical and unsymmetrical rim&#8208;functionalized PAs A&#8211;D that are able to transport ca. 107&#8211;108 water molecules/s/channel, which is within 1 order of magnitude of AQPs&#8217; and show total ion and proton rejection. Among the four channels, C and D are 3&#8211;4&#8197;times more water permeable than A and B when inserted in bilayer membranes. The binary combinations of A&#8211;D with different molar ratios could be expressed as an independent (linear ABA), a recessive (inhibition AB, AC, DB, ACA), or a dominant (amplification, DBD) behavior of the water net permeation events.

         <title>Biaxially&#8208;Strained Phthalocyanine at Polyoxometalate@Carbon Nanotube Heterostructure Boosts Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising non&#8208;precious molecular catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To enhance its catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability, a host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to fabricate one&#8208;dimensional ternary heterostructure of FePc&#8208;polyoxometalate@carbon nanotubes. The polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated nanotubes are able to tune the structure and ORR performances of FeN4 centers.

Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) with unique FeN4 site has attracted increasing interests as a promising non&#8208;precious catalyst. However, the plane symmetric structure endows FePc with undesired catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel one&#8208;dimensional heterostructured ORR catalyst by coupling FePc at polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanotubes (FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NTs) using host&#8208;guest chemistry. The encapsulation of polyoxometalates can induce a local tensile strain of single&#8208;walled NTs to strengthen the interactions with FePc. Both the strain and curvature effects of {PW12}@NT scaffold tune the geometric structure and electronic localization of FeN4 centers to enhance the ORR catalytic performance. As expected, such a heterostructured FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NT electrocatalyst exhibits prominent durability, methanol tolerance, and ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#8197;V and a low Tafel slope of 30.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline medium. Besides, the assembled zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrates an ultrahigh power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, excellent charge/discharge ability and long&#8208;term stability over 500&#8197;h, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 cathode. This study offers a new strategy to design novel heterostructured catalysts and opens a new avenue to regulate the electrocatalytic performance of phthalocyanine molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising non-precious molecular catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To enhance its catalytic activity and long-term durability, a host-guest self-assembly strategy is employed to fabricate one-dimensional ternary heterostructure of FePc-polyoxometalate@carbon nanotubes. The polyoxometalate-encapsulated nanotubes are able to tune the structure and ORR performances of FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8211;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8210;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Stacking and Aggregation Optimization of Photoactive Layer through Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer is a critical but challenging issue in developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Herein, two structurally similar analogues of anthra[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (ADT) and naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (NDT) are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer. We clarify that the perpendicular arrangements of NDT can enlarge the molecular packing space and improve the face&#8208;on stacking of Y6 during the film formation, favoring a more compact and ordered long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction after the removal of NDT under thermal annealing. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked herringbone&#8208;arrangement of ADT along with its non&#8208;volatilization under thermal annealing can induce the coexistence of face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on stacking of blend film. As a result, the NDT treatment shows encouraging effect in improving the photovoltaic performance of devices based on various systems. Particularly, a remarkable PCE of 18.85% is achieved in the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated by NDT additive, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 16.41% for the control device. This work offers a promising strategy to regulate the molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer towards significantly improved performance and stability of organic solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition&#8208;metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D&#8208;incorporation (D&#8208;inc, up to &gt; 99%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiment and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late&#8208;stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report    a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in oC), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key   *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8208; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in Mononuclear Yb/Sm Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based upconversion luminescence transforming high&#8208;energy photons into low&#8208;energy photons is an attractive anti&#8208;Stokes shift process for fundamental research and promising applications. In this work, we developed the upconversion luminescence in co&#8208;crystal assemblies consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes. The characteristic visible emissions of Sm3+ were observed under the excitation of absorption band of Yb3+ at 980 nm. A series of co&#8208;crystal assemblies were investigated based on mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes, and the strongest luminescence was obtained when the molar concentration between Yb3+ and Sm3+ is equivalent. The crystal structure was fully characterized by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and upconverting energy transfer mechanisms were verified as cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion. This is the first example of Sm3+&#8208;based upconverting luminescence in discrete lanthanide complexes which present as co&#8208;crystal assemblies at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol&#8208;containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent. The best performing cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF hybrid catalyzes hydrogen production with an average HER rate up to 38 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 in ethanol/phosphate buffer solution under 4 h illumination. Ultrafast transient optical spectroscopy characterizations and charge carrier analysis reveal that the alcohol contents functioning as hole scavengers could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes of COFs to form aldehydes and protons. The consumption of the photogenerated holes thus suppresses exciton recombination of COFs and improves the ratio of free electrons that were effectively utilized to drive catalytic reaction for HER. This work demonstrates a great potential of COF&#8208;catalyzed HER using alcohol solvents as hole scavengers and provides an example toward realizing the accessibility to the scope of reaction conditions and a greener route for energy conversion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report an azide-functionalized cobaloxime proton-reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster-type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime-modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol-containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent.

         <title>Photochemical Desaturation and Epoxidation with Oxygen by Sequential Flavin Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, flavoenzymes mediate mechanistically unrelated transformations such as desaturations and epoxidations with oxygen from air. We disclose the combination of both activities in a sequential fashion using molecular flavin catalysts in the organic laboratory. Our protocol consists of initial photochemical desaturation of silyl enol ethers and subsequent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketone formation with molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Catalytic desaturations are important strategies for the functionalization of organic molecules. In nature, flavoenzymes mediate the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds by concomitant cofactor reduction. Contrary to many laboratory methods for these reactions, such as the Saegusa&#8208;Ito oxidation, no transition metal reagents or catalysts are required. However, a molecular flavin&#8208;mediated variant has not been reported so far. We disclose a photochemical approach for silyl enol ether oxidation, which leads to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (13 examples) in very good yields. The flavin catalysts are stable throughout the desaturation reaction, and we successfully applied them in a subsequent aerobic epoxidation by simply changing the reaction conditions. This protocol allowed us to directly convert silyl enol ethers into &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketones in a one&#8208;pot fashion (12 examples). Sequential flavin catalysis is not limited to one specific reactivity combination and can, inter alia, couple the photochemical oxidation with radical additions. We anticipate that flavin&#8208;catalyzed desaturation will be applicable to other substrate classes and that its sequential catalytic activity will enable rapid substrate diversification.

         <title>Electrochemical Reversible Reforming between Ethylamine and Acetonitrile on Heterostructured Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a successful development of an ethylenediamine&#8208;acetonitrile electrochemical reversible reformation system was achieved, utilizing a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 heterostructured catalyst synthesized through an in situ construction strategy as the multifunctional catalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of electrocatalysts is essential to achieve desirable performance of electrochemical synthesis process. Heterostructured catalysts have thus attracted widespread attention due to their multifunctional intrinsic properties, and diverse catalytic applications with corresponding outstanding activities. Here, we report an in situ restoration strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Such Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit excellent activity and selectivity towards reversible electrochemical reforming of ethylamine and acetonitrile. In the acetonitrile reduction process, Pd acts as reaction center, while Ni(OH)2 provide proton hydrogen through promoting the dissociation of water. Also ethylamine oxidation process can be achieved on the surface of the heterostructured nanosheets with abundant Ni(II) defects. More importantly, an electrolytic cell driven by solar cells was successfully constructed to realize ethylamine&#8208;acetonitrile reversible reforming. This work demonstrates the importance of heterostructure engineering in the rational synthesis of multifunctional catalysts towards electrochemical synthesis of fine chemicals.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Transfer&#8208;Based High&#8208;Capacity Organic Lithium&#8208;Iodine (Chlorine) Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The static organic lithium&#8208;iodine (chlorine) batteries fueled by brand&#8208;new three&#8208;electron redox chemistry (redox couples: I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0) with electrochemically active tetrabutylammonium triiodide cathode exhibit the excellent specific energy density, representing a significant advancement in the field of halogen battery.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type batteries apply the principle that more charge transfer is preferable. The underutilized electron transfer mode within two undermines the electrochemical performance of halogen batteries. Here, we realised a three&#8208;electron transfer lithium&#8208;halogen battery based on I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0 couples by using a common commercial electrolyte saturated with Cl&#8722; anions. The resulting Li||tetrabutylammonium triiodide (TBAI3) cell exhibits three distinct discharging plateaus at 2.97, 3.40, and 3.85&#8197;V. Moreover, it has a high capacity of 631&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1I (265&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1electrode, based on entire mass loading) and record&#8208;high energy density of up to 2013&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1I (845&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1electrode). To support these findings, experimental characterisations and density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the redox chemistry involved in this novel interhalogen strategy. We believe our paradigm presented here has a foreseeable inspiring effect on other halogen batteries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pursuit.

         <title>Harnessing Transition Metal Scaffolds for Targeted Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious threats to public health but the problem is compounded by the lack of new drugs with new modes of action in the development pipeline. In this review, we spotlight four emerging antibacterial strategies that take advantages of the unique chemical properties of transition metal complexes, namely Trojan horse, triggered warhead release, &#8220;new&#8208;to&#8208;nature&#8221; chemistry, and biomimetic reactions. We further propose that transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible using pure organic scaffolds.







Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance, caused by persistent adaptation and growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to overprescribed antibiotics, poses one of the most serious and urgent threats to global public health. The limited pipeline of experimental antibiotics in development further exacerbates this looming crisis and new drugs with alternative modes of action are needed to tackle evolving pathogenic adaptation. Transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible using pure organic scaffolds. We spotlight four emerging strategies to harness these unique properties to develop new targeted antibacterial agents.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation&#8208;Induced Glycolate Aldol Additions of Silyl Glyoxylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral (diene)Rh(I) complex catalyzes the enantioselective three&#8208;component coupling reaction of silyl glyoxylates, boronic acids, and aldehydes to yield complex fully substituted mandelates. Notable features include the mild generation of chiral Rh&#8208;enolates by 1,2&#8208;Brook rearrangement and, from that point, modular preparation of glycolate aldol adducts.







Abstract
(Diene)Rh(I) complexes catalyze the stereoselective three&#8208;component coupling of silyl glyoxylates, arylboronic acids, and aldehydes to give glycolate aldol products. The participation of Rh&#8208;alkoxides in the requisite Brook rearrangement was established through two component Rh&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silyl glyoxylates with ArB(OH)2 to give silyl&#8208;protected mandelate derivatives. The intermediacy of a chiral Rh&#8208;enolate was inferred through enantioselective protonation using a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyst. Diastereoselective three&#8208;component couplings with aldehydes as terminating electrophiles to give racemic products were best achieved with a bulky aryl ester on the silyl glyoxylate reagent. Optimal enantioselective couplings were carried out with the tert&#8208;butyl ester variant using an anisole&#8208;derived enantiopure tricyclo[3.2.2.02,4]nonadiene ligand.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Diene)Rh(I) complexes catalyze the stereoselective three-component coupling of silyl glyoxylates, arylboronic acids, and aldehydes to give glycolate aldol products. The participation of Rh-alkoxides in the requisite Brook rearrangement was established through two component Rh-catalyzed couplings of silyl glyoxylates with ArB(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give silyl-protected mandelate derivatives. The intermediacy of a chiral Rh-enolate was inferred through enantioselective protonation using a chiral Rh-catalyst. Diastereoselective three-component couplings with aldehydes as terminating electrophiles to give racemic products were best achieved with a bulky aryl ester on the silyl glyoxylate reagent. Optimal enantioselective couplings were carried out with the &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl ester variant using an anisole-derived enantiopure tricyclo[3.2.2.0&lt;sup&gt;2,4&lt;/sup&gt;]nonadiene ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multitargeting Prodrugs that Release Oxaliplatin, Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine are Potent Inhibitors of Tumor Growth and Effective Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtIV prodrug (2) can release Gem, Oxal, and Dox in their active form upon cellular reduction. It effectively induces release of ICD markers, DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells and exhibited superior in vivo tumor growth inhibition in two murine models (LLC and CT26) with significantly lower body weight loss. An ICD re&#8208;challenge study showed better tumor free survival compared to the FDA drugs.







Abstract
A multitargeting prodrug (2) that releases gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin in their active form in cancer cells is a potent cytotoxic agent with nM IC50s; it is highly selective to cancer cells with mean selectivity indices to human (136) and murine (320) cancer cells. It effectively induces release of DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells facilitating more efficient phagocytosis by J774 macrophages than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration. The viability of CT26 cells co&#8208;cultured with J774 macrophages and treated with 2 was reduced by 32&#8201;% compared to the non&#8208;treated cells, suggesting a synergistic antiproliferative effect between the chemical and immune reactions. 2 inhibited in vivo tumor growth in two murine models (LLC and CT26) better than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration with significantly lower body weight loss. Mice inoculated with CT26 cells treated with 2 showed slightly better tumor free survival than doxorubicin.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Unstrained Heterocycles Using Cobalt Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt catalysts promote enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of unstrained heterocycles by the reductive addition of 1,1&#8208;dichloroalkenes. The products are acyclic homoallylic alcohols containing a vinylzinc motif, which can be further functionalized with an electrophile. Mechanistic studies suggest that ring&#8208;opening occurs by an outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by a Zn(II) Lewis acid.







Abstract
Cobalt catalysts promote highly enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans using vinylidenes. The products are acyclic organozinc compounds that can be functionalized with an electrophile. The proposed mechanism involves the generation of a cobalt vinylidene species that adds to the alkene by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition pathway. Ring&#8208;opening then occurs via outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by coordination of a ZnX2 Lewis acid to the alkoxide leaving group. DFT models reveal that competing inner&#8208;sphere syn &#946;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;O elimination pathways are suppressed by the geometric constraints of the metallacycle intermediate. These models rationalize the observed stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

         <title>Enzymatic Oxy&#8208; and Amino&#8208;Functionalization in Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygenation and amination reactions are widely spread in synthetic chemistry to produce valuable compounds. Nowadays, the importance of sustainable strategies to introduce oxygen and amino functionalities into organic molecules is increasing. This review discusses recent examples of multi&#8208;step biocatalytic cascades involving oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions to produce value&#8208;added compounds such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are a powerful tool for building complex molecules containing oxygen and nitrogen functionalities. Moreover, the combination of multiple enzymes in one pot offers the possibility to minimize downstream processing and waste production. In this review, we illustrate various recent efforts in the development of multi&#8208;step syntheses involving C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming enzymes to produce high value&#8208;added compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors. Both in vitro and in vivo examples are discussed, revealing the respective advantages and drawbacks. The use of engineered enzymes to boost the cascades outcome is also addressed and current co&#8208;substrate and cofactor recycling strategies are presented, highlighting the importance of atom economy. Finally, tools to overcome current challenges for multi&#8208;enzymatic oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions are discussed, including flow systems with immobilized biocatalysts and cascades in confined nanomaterials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Phase&#8208;Separating Fluorescent Molecules for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we designed a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compound that forms molecular coacervates based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the aqueous solution. The molecular coacervates deliver proteins into mammalian cells and disperse the payload within the cytosol upon photoillumination. This work showcases a small&#8208;molecule coacervation system and photoresponsive cytosolic protein delivery.







Abstract
Cellular membranes, including the plasma and endosome membranes, are barriers to outside proteins. Various vehicles have been devised to deliver proteins across the plasma membrane, but in many cases, the payload gets trapped in the endosome. Here we designed a photo&#8208;responsive phase&#8208;separating fluorescent molecule (PPFM) with a molecular weight of 666.8 daltons. The PPFM compound condensates as fluorescent droplets in the aqueous solution by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), which disintegrate upon photoirradiation with a 405&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) lamp within 20&#8197;min or a 405&#8197;nm laser within 3&#8197;min. The PPFM coacervates recruit a wide range of peptides and proteins and deliver them into mammalian cells. Photolysis disperses the payload from condensates into the cytosolic space. Altogether, a type of small molecules that are photo&#8208;responsive and phase separating are discovered; their coacervates can serve as transmembrane vehicles for intracellular delivery of proteins, whereas photo illumination triggers the cytosolic distribution of the payload.

         <title>Superparamagnetic Composite Nanobeads Anchored with Molecular Glues for Ultrasensitive Label&#8208;free Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coverage of label&#8208;free proteomics for precious trace specimens is limited due to redundant pretreatments. We design molecular glue&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles equipped with protein anchors to capture proteins in complex trace biological samples. We propose a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) in one single tube to reduce protein loss for ultrasensitive proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry has emerged as a mainstream technique for label&#8208;free proteomics. However, proteomic coverage for trace samples is constrained by adsorption loss during repeated elution at sample pretreatment. Here, we demonstrated superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles functionalized with molecular glues (MGs) to enrich proteins in trace human biofluid. We showed high protein binding (&gt;95&#8201;%) and recovery (&#8776;90&#8201;%) rates by anchor&#8208;nanoparticles. We further proposed a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) method that enabled unbiased protein capture, protein digestion and pure peptides elution in one single tube. We demonstrated SWAP to quantify over 2500 protein groups with 100 HEK 293T cells. We adopted SWAP to profile proteomics with trace aqueous humor samples from cataract (n=15) and wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (n=8) patients, and quantified &#8776;1400 proteins from 5&#8197;&#956;L aqueous humor. SWAP simplifies sample preparation steps, minimizes adsorption loss and improves protein coverage for label&#8208;free proteomics with previous trace samples.

We adopted SWAP to profile proteomics with trace aqueous humor samples from cataract (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=15) and wet age-related macular degeneration (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=8) patients, and quantified &#8776;1400 proteins from 5&#8197;&#956;L aqueous humor. SWAP simplifies sample preparation steps, minimizes adsorption loss and improves protein coverage for label-free proteomics with previous trace samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Templated Total Synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;Methanobactin OB3b
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;methanobactin OB3b, a unique carcerand&#8208;like chalkophore, is reported. Key features were a cyclodehydratation&#8208;thioacylation sequence for accessing two unprecedented azlactone building blocks and metal ion&#8208;templation for enabling cyclization of the methanobactin peptide backbone.







Abstract
Methanobactin OB3b (Mbn&#8208;OB3b) is a unique natural product with stunning affinity for copper ions (Ka&#8776;Cu(I) 1034). Here, we report the first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;bound methanobactin OB3b featuring as key transformations a cyclodehydration&#8208;thioacylation sequence, to generate the conjugated heterocyclic systems, and a copper&#8208;templated cyclization, to complete the caged structure of the very sensitive target compound.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorbing Monodispersed Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light absorption were developed based on resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). Interesting properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance are demonstrated with the monodisperse oligomers. The pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169&#8197;nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the tetramer as the electron acceptor shows a peak specific detectivity of 2.98&#215;1011 Jones at 1180&#8197;nm under zero bias, which is among the best for NIR II OPDs.







Abstract
Organic molecules with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR II) light absorption are essential for many biological and opto&#8208;electronic applications. Herein, we report monodispersed oligomers as NIR II light absorber using a new molecular design strategy of resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). We synthesize a series of monodispersed oligomers with thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TB), which contains resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, as the repeating unit. The TB pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169&#8197;nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the TB tetramer as the electron acceptor shows the specific detectivity of 2.98&#215;1011 Jones at 1180&#8197;nm under zero bias. This performance is among the best for NIR II OPDs. These results indicate a new kind of NIR II absorbing molecules as excellent opto&#8208;electronic materials.

         <title>Functionalization of Pentacene: A Facile and Versatile Approach to Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes has proven to be the key step in the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Despite their highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs also exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
In this work, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) starting from the functionalized pentacene was established. A series of novel PAHs 1&#8211;4 and their derivatives were synthesized through a simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes 5&#8211;8 as a key step. All the molecules were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied in detail. Interestingly, the most striking feature of 1&#8211;4 is their highly contorted carbon structures and the accompanying helical chirality. In particular, the optical resolution of 2 was successfully achieved by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC, and the enantiomers were characterized by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence spectroscopy. Despite the highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields, implying the potential utility of this series PAHs as high&#8208;quality organic laser dyes. By using a self&#8208;assembly method with the help of epoxy resin, a bottle microlaser based on 3&#8201;a was successfully illustrated with a lasing wavelength of 567.8&#8197;nm at a threshold of 0.3&#8197;mJ/cm2. We believe that this work will shed light on the chemical versatility of pentacene and its derivatives in the construction of novel functionalized PAHs.

         <title>Asymmetric Allenylation of Alkynes mediated by Chiral Organoselenated Reagents under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium&#8208;mediated methodology for the asymmetric synthesis of allenyl amides is described. This was achieved in two steps from simple alkynes, and features highly stereocontrolled &#946;&#8208;H&#8208;syn&#8208;eliminations of vinyl selenoxides performed with good yields and ee up to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reactivity of novel chiral lactamide&#8208;substituted diselenide&#8208;based reagents under oxidative conditions was exploited to develop a metal&#8208;free method for the preparation of enantioenriched allenylamides from simple alkynes in good yields, and with enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The key of the success in this method is attributed to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded lactamide appendages that ensure configurational stability of chiral vinyl selenoxide intermediates for an optimal enantiotopic &#946;&#8208;syn&#8208;elimination step.

         <title>Taming of Furfurylidenes by Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Catalysts: Preparation and Functionalization of Optically Active 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (Trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although 2&#8208;furyl&#8208;carbenes (furfurylidenes) are prone to instantaneous electrocyclic ring opening, chiral [BiRh]&#8208;paddlewheel complexes empowered by London dispersion allow (trifluoromethyl)furfurylidene metal complexes to be generated from a bench&#8208;stable triftosylhydrazone precursor. These reactive intermediates engage in asymmetric [2+1] cycloadditions and hence open entry into valuable trifluoromethylated cyclopropane or &#8722;cyclopropene in optically active form, which are important building blocks for medicinal chemistry but difficult to make otherwise.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy&#8208;atom tunneling limits the lifetime and observability of bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene, a key intermediate in the rearrangement of phenylcarbene. Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene had been proposed as the primary intermediate of the rearrangement of phenylcarbene, but despite many efforts evaded its characterization even in cryogenic matrices. By introducing fluorine substituents into the ortho&#8208;positions of the phenyl ring of phenylcarbene, the highly strained cyclopropene 1,5&#8208;difluorobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene becomes stable enough to be characterized in cryogenic matrices. However, even at 3 K this cyclopropene is only metastable and rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to the corresponding cycloheptatetraene. Calculations suggest that the fluorination is necessary to slow down the tunneling rearrangement of the bicycloheptatriene. The parent bicycloheptatriene rapidly rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunnelling and therefore cannot be detected in cryogenic matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Supramolecular Networks: Emergent Sensing from Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular differentiation by supramolecular sensors is typically achieved through sensor arrays, relying on the pattern recognition responses of large panels of isolated sensing elements. Here we report a new one&#8208;pot systems chemistry approach to differential sensing in biological solutions. We constructed an adaptive network of three cross&#8208;assembling sensor elements with diverse analyte&#8208;binding and photophysical properties. This robust sensing approach exploits complex interconnected sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte equilibria, producing emergent supramolecular and photophysical responses unique to each analyte. We characterize the basic mechanisms by which an adaptive network responds to analytes. The inherently data&#8208;rich responses of an adaptive network discriminate among very closely related proteins&#160;and protein mixtures&#160;without relying on designed protein recognition elements. We show that a single adaptive sensing solution provides better analyte discrimination using fewer response observations than a sensor array built from the same components. We also show the network&#8217;s ability to adapt and respond to changing biological solutions over time.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and Propane over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite: Insights into Reaction Mechanism and Product Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite (CuMOR) is capable of activation of C&#8208;H bonds in C1&#8208;C3 alkanes, albeit there are remarkable differences between the functionalization of ethane and propane compared to methane. The reaction of ethane and propane with CuMOR results in the formation of ethylene and propylene, while the reaction of methane predominantly yields methanol and dimethyl ether. By combining in situ FTIR and MAS NMR spectroscopies as well as time&#8208;resolved Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the reaction mechanism was derived, which differs significantly for each alkane. The formation of ethylene and propylene proceeds via oxidative dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes with selectivity above 95% for ethane and above 85 % for propane. The formation of stable &#960;&#8208;complexes of olefins with CuI sites, formed upon reduction of CuII&#8208;oxo species, protects olefins from further oxidation and/or oligomerization. This is different from methane, the activation of which proceeds via oxidative hydroxylation leading to the formation of surface methoxy species bonded to the zeolite framework. Our findings constitute one of the major steps in the direct conversion of alkanes to important commodities and open a novel research direction aiming at the selective synthesis of olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Lead for Tin in PbHfO3: Noncubic Structure of SnHfO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The removal of lead from commercialized perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics has been a recent major topic in materials research owing to legislation in many countries. In this regard, Sn(II)&#8208;perovskite oxides have garnered keen interest due to their predicted large spontaneous electric polarizations and isoelectronic nature for substitution of Pb(II) cations. However, they have not been considered synthesizable owing to their high metastability. Herein, the perovskite lead hafnate, i.e., PbHfO3 in space group Pbam, is shown to react with SnClF at a low temperature of 300 &#176;C, and resulting in the first complete Sn(II)&#8208;for&#8208;Pb(II) substitution, i.e. SnHfO3. During this topotactic transformation, a high purity and crystallinity is conserved with Pbam symmetry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, elemental analysis, and 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. In situ diffraction shows SnHfO3 also possesses reversible phase transformations and is potentially polar between ~130&#8208;200 &#176;C. This so&#8208;called &#8216;de&#8208;leadification&#8217; is thus shown to represent a highly useful strategy to fully remove lead from perovskite&#8208;oxide&#8208;based piezoceramics and opening the door to new explorations of polar and antipolar Sn(II)&#8208;oxide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Interphasial Pre&#8208;lithiation and Reinforcement of Micro&#8208;Si Anode through Fluorine&#8208;free Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micro&#8208;sized silicon (mSi) anodes offer advantages in cost and tap density over nanosized counterparts. However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)&#8208;free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre&#8208;lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F&#8208;free electrolyte brings unprecedented F&#8208;free interphase that also enables the high&#8208;performance mSi electrode (80 wt% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900 mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This work confirms the feasibility of F&#8208;free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost&#8208;advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferric Single&#8208;Site Catalyst Confined in a Zeolite Framework for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a highly efficient approach for propene industry that is commonly catalyzed by noble Pt or toxic Cr catalysts and suffers from coking. In this work, zeolite framework confined ferric catalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal procedure. The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedron, which was beneficial for the selectively dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95% propene selectivity and over 99% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had silanol free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable and coke free, with the deactivation constant of 0.01 h&#8208;1. This study provided a guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation over early&#8208;transition metal.</dc:description>

The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedron, which was beneficial for the selectively dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95% propene selectivity and over 99% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had silanol free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable and coke free, with the deactivation constant of 0.01 h-1. This study provided a guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non-oxidative dehydrogenation over early-transition metal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Manganese and Iminium Catalysis: Selective Hydroalkenylation of Unsaturated Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of synergistic catalytic strategy can usually circumvent the intrinsic limitations of one catalytic system. In this communication, we disclose a cooperative catalysis strategy of manganese and iminium catalysis to realize selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Its success stems from the LUMO activation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds with secondary amines as the organocatalyst and the synergistic HOMO activation of alkenylboronic acids with Mn2(CO)8Br2. This protocol exhibits several synthetic advances, e.g., simple operation, good functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. The theoretical calculation indicates the migratory insertion followed by demetallation&#8208;isomerization process is kinetically more favorable than Michael&#8208;like nucleophilic addition. The use of proline&#8208;derived organocatalyst together with mangansese(I) catalyst can deliver the desired products in moderate enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Electrolyte Concentration and Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Surface toward Actuating Fast Zn2+ Dehydration for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional porous coating on zinc electrode is emerging as a powerful ionic sieve to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby improving highly reversible aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, the ultrafast charge rate is limited by the substantial cation transmission strongly associated with dehydration efficiency. Here, we unveil the entire dynamic process of solvated Zn2+ ions&#8217; continuous dehydration from electrolyte across the MOF&#8208;electrolyte interface into channels with the aid of molecular simulations, taking zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The moderate concentration of 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte being advantageous over other concentrations possesses the homogeneous water&#8208;mediated ion pairing distribution, resulting in the lowest dehydration energy, which elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying such concentration adopted by numerous experimental studies. Furthermore, we show that modifying linkers on the ZIF&#8208;7 surface with hydrophilic groups such as &#8208;OH or &#8208;NH2 can weaken the solvation shell of Zn2+ ions to lower the dehydration free energy by approximately 1 eV, and may improve the electrical conductivity of MOF. These results shed light on the ions delivery mechanism and pave way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities through atomic&#8208;scale modification of functional porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Bis(oxalate)borate Additive for Self&#8208;repairing Zincophilic Solid Electrolyte Interphases towards Ultrahigh&#8208;rate and Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in Zn anode stabilization but its long&#8208;term effectiveness at high rates is still challenged. Herein, to achieve superior long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate Zn anode, an exquisite electrolyte additive, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), is proposed to in&#8208;situ derive a highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI and to dynamically patrol its cycling&#8208;initiated defects. Profiting from the as&#8208;constructed real&#8208;time, automatic SEI repairing mechanism, the Zn anode can be cycled with distinct reversibility over 1800 h at an ultrahigh current density of 50 mA cm&#8208;2, presenting a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity up to 45 Ah cm&#8722;2. The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO2 and Zn||NaV3O8 full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500 cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy sources.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystals (LCs) is a fascinating method for controlling the organization of discrete molecules into nanostructured functional materials. Although LCs are traditionally processed in thin film, their confinement within micrometre&#8208;sized droplets has recently revealed new properties and functions for the design of next&#8208;generation soft responsive materials. These recent findings have enabled a wealth of unprecedented applications in photonics (e.g., reflectors, lasing materials), sensing (e.g., detection of biomolecules, pathogens), soft robotics (e.g., micropumps, artificial muscles), and beyond. This minireview focuses on recent developments in the design of LC emulsions and highlights a variety of novel potential applications.

         <title>Programmable and self&#8208;healable liquid crystal elastomer actuators based on halogen bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shape&#8208;changing polymeric materials have gained significant attention in the field of bioinspired soft robotics. However, challenges remain in versatilizing the shape&#8208;morphing process to suit different tasks and environments, and in designing systems that combine reversible actuation and self&#8208;healing ability. Here, we report halogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that can be arbitrarily shape&#8208;programmed and that self&#8208;heal under mild thermal or photothermal stimulation. We incorporate halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating diiodotetrafluorobenzene molecules as dynamic supramolecular crosslinks into the LCEs and show that these relatively weak crosslinks are pertinent for their mechanical programming and self&#8208;healing. Utilizing the halogen&#8208;bonded LCEs, we demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept soft robotic motions such as crawling and rolling with programmed velocities. Our results showcase halogen bonding as a promising, yet unexplored tool for the preparation of smart supramolecular constructs for the development of advanced soft actuators.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Proteins with highly hydrophobic regions or aggregation&#8208;prone sequences are typically difficult targets for chemical synthesis at the current stage, as obtaining such type of peptides via solid phase peptide synthesis requires sophisticated operations. Herein, we report the N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) as robust and effective building blocks to allow direct synthesis of difficult peptides/proteins via a kinked backbone strategy. The effectiveness and easy accessibility of NBDs have been well demonstrated in our chemical syntheses of various challenging peptides/proteins, including chemokine, therapeutic hormones, histone and glycosylated erythropoietin.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Subphthalocyanine Cage as Catalytic Container for the Functionalization of Fullerenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first example of a supramolecular cage that works as a catalytic molecular reactor to perform transformations over fullerenes in aqueous medium. Taking advantage of the ability of metallo&#8208;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine (SubPc) capsules to form stable host:guest complexes with C60, we have prepared a water&#8208;soluble cage that provides a hydrophobic environment for conducting cycloadditions over encapsulated C60, namely, Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with anthracene. Indeed, the presence of catalytic amounts of solubilized SubPc cage promotes co&#8208;encapsulation of insoluble C60 and anthracene substrates, allowing the reaction to occur inside the cavity under mild conditions. The lower stability of the host:guest complex with the C60 cycloadduct facilitates displacement by pristine C60, allowing catalytic turnover. Moreover, bis&#8208;addition compounds are regioselectively formed inside the cage when using excess anthracene.</dc:description>
