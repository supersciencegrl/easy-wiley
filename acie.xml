         <title>N,O&#8208;Benzylidene Acetal Dipeptides (NBDs) Enable the Synthesis of Difficult Peptides via a Kinked Backbone Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) can serve as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and highly effective building blocks to enable syntheses of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked peptide backbone strategy. The scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis and the proven effectiveness for the synthesis of difficult peptides render NBDs valuable tools for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in both academic research and industrial applications.







Abstract
Proteins with highly hydrophobic regions or aggregation&#8208;prone sequences are typically difficult targets for chemical synthesis at the current stage, as obtaining such type of peptides via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis requires sophisticated operations. Herein, we report N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) as robust and effective building blocks to allow the direct synthesis of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked backbone strategy. The effectiveness and easy accessibility of NBDs have been well demonstrated in our chemical syntheses of various challenging peptides and proteins, including chemokine, therapeutic hormones, histone, and glycosylated erythropoietin.

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis Towards Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy was developed to facilitate both C2H4 epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO) and CO2 reduction to C2H4 for improved tandem electrosynthesis of EO from CO2 and water, using single&#8208;atom Pt anchored on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) with a high atomic utilization and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O with stable Cu+ species as highly efficient anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively.







Abstract
The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently has a mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4 to EO and CO2 to C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediate binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2&#8201;%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9&#8201;% at 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to those in the traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE as high as 41.1&#8201;% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.

         <title>Merging the Isonitrile&#8208;Tetrazine (4+1) Cycloaddition and the Ugi Four&#8208;Component Reaction into a Single Multicomponent Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multicomponent process combining the features of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4 +1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction was developed. The multicomponent reaction takes advantage of the click reactivities of the first step and provides access to so&#8208;far inaccessible chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are of utmost importance at generating a unique, wide, and complex chemical space. Herein we describe a novel multicomponent approach based on the combination of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4+1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction to generate pyrazole amide derivatives. The scope of the reaction as well as mechanistic insights governing the 4H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;imine tautomerization are provided. This multicomponent process provides access to a new chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives and offers a tool for peptide modification and stapling.

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(Alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system has been developed for efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores with high site selectivity. The excellent functional group compatibility, scalability, use of readily available starting materials, and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization underscore the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research.







Abstract
Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapid synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.

         <dc:description>
An azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks is developed for achieving the enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in alcohol&#8208;containing solutions without any sacrificial agent.







Abstract

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Afterglow for White&#8208;Light Emission and Information Encryption Based on Carbazole Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;mode emission materials, combining phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, offer promising opportunities for white&#8208;light afterglow. However, the delayed fluorescence lifetime is usually significantly shorter than that of phosphorescence, limiting the duration of white&#8208;light emission. In this study, a carbazole&#8208;based host&#8208;guest system that can be activated by both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light is reported to achieve balanced phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, resulting in a long&#8208;lived white&#8208;light afterglow. Our study demonstrated the critical role of a charge transfer state in the afterglow mechanism, where the charge separation and recombination process directly determined the lifetime of afterglow. Simultaneously, an efficient reversed intersystem crossing process was obtained between the singlet and triplet charge transfer states, which further boosted the delayed fluorescence properties of the doping system. As a result, delayed fluorescence lifetime was successfully prolonged to approach that of phosphorescence. This work presents a delayed fluorescence lifetime improvement strategy via doping method to realize durable white&#8208;light afterglow.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photon&#8208;upconversion in organic molecular systems is one of the promising technologies for future energy harvesting systems because these systems can generate excitons that possess higher energy than excitation energy. The photon&#8208;upconversion caused by absorbing ambient heat as additional energy is particularly interesting because it could ideally provide a light&#8208;driving cooling system. However, only a few organic molecular systems have been reported. Here, we report the anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1 eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state. The anti&#8208;Stokes shift corresponded well to the 1&#8208;0 vibration transition from the ground state to the excited singlet state, and we further evaluated a correlation between the activation energy for the ASPL intensity and the TADF process. Our demonstration underlines that MR&#8208;TADF molecules have become a novel class of ASPL materials for various future applications, such as light&#8208;driving cooling systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia via Tuning of N&#8208;Intermediate Adsorption on a Zn&#8722;Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;doped Cu catalyst is used for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. The Faradaic efficiency of NH3 can reach 98.4&#8201;% with a yield rate of 5.8&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1. The Zn dopants play a key role in modulating the adsorption strength of intermediates, enhancing the conversion of nitrite, altering the configuration of adsorbed *NO species to bridge adsorption, and reducing the energy barrier, leading to the high catalytic performance in NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.







Abstract
The renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;powered electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) has garnered significant interest as an eco&#8208;friendly and promising substitute for the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the sluggish kinetics hinders its application at a large scale. Herein, we first calculated the N&#8208;containing species (*NO3 and *NO2) binding energy and the free energy of the hydrogen evolution reaction over Cu with different metal dopants, and it was shown that Zn was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we designed and synthesized Zn&#8208;doped Cu nanosheets, and the as&#8208;prepared catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3. The maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of NH3 could reach 98.4&#8201;% with an outstanding yield rate of 5.8&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is among the best results up to date. The catalyst also had excellent cycling stability. Meanwhile, it also presented a FE exceeding 90&#8201;% across a wide potential range and NO3&#8722; concentration range. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Zn doping could modulate intermediates adsorption strength, enhance NO2&#8722; conversion, change the *NO adsorption configuration to a bridge adsorption, and decrease the energy barrier, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>Distinct Selectivity Control in Solar&#8208;Driven Bio&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Hydroxyl Acid Conversion: A Comparison of Pt Nanoparticles and Atomically Dispersed Pt on CdS</title>

         <dc:description>
Distinct selectivity control along with highly efficient H2 production are achieved in photocatalytic conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids by tuning the nature of Pt species deposited on CdS.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic lignocellulose conversion is a promising strategy for the sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals, but selectivity control remains a challenging goal in this field. Here, we report efficient and selective conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids to tartaric acid derivatives, &#945;&#8208;keto acids, and H2 using Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. Pt nanoparticles on CdS selectively produce tartaric acid derivatives via C&#8722;C coupling, while atomically dispersed Pt on CdS switches product selectivity to the oxidation reaction to produce &#945;&#8208;keto acids. The atomically dispersed Pt species stabilized by Pt&#8722;S bonds promote the activation of the hydroxyl group and thus switch product selectivity from tartaric acid derivatives to &#945;&#8208;keto acids. A broad range of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids was applied for preparing the corresponding tartaric acid derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids over the two Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. This work highlights the unique performance of metal sulfides in coupling reactions and demonstrates a strategy for rationally tuning product selectivity by engineering the interaction between metal sulfide and cocatalyst.

         <title>Alternatives to Styrene&#8208; and Diisobutylene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Membrane Protein Solubilization via Nanodisc Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene&#8208; and diisobutylene&#8208;based amphiphilic copolymers are invaluable tools for the extraction of integral membrane proteins. However, they have several issues that limit their efficacy and applicability. A tailorable polymeric platform is now introduced that overcomes many of these limitations, including having low UV absorbance, high protein extraction yields, and retention of native&#8208;like protein structure, as well as being readily synthesized.







Abstract
Styrene&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (SMAs), and related amphiphilic copolymers, are promising tools for isolating and studying integral membrane proteins in a native&#8208;like state. However, they do not exhibit this ability universally, as several reports have found that SMAs and related amphiphilic copolymers show little to no efficiency when extracting specific membrane proteins. Recently, it was discovered that esterified SMAs could enhance the selective extraction of trimeric Photosystem I from the thylakoid membranes of thermophilic cyanobacteria; however, these polymers are susceptible to saponification that can result from harsh preparation or storage conditions. To address this concern, we herein describe the development of &#945;&#8208;olefin&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (&#945;MAs) that can extract trimeric PSI from cyanobacterial membranes with the highest extraction efficiencies observed when using any amphiphilic copolymers, including diisobutylene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic acid (DIBMA) and functionalized SMA samples. Furthermore, we will show that &#945;MAs facilitate the formation of photosystem I&#8208;containing nanodiscs that retain an annulus of native lipids and a native&#8208;like activity. We also highlight how &#945;MAs provide an agile, tailorable synthetic platform that enables fine&#8208;tuning hydrophobicity, controllable molar mass, and consistent monomer incorporation while overcoming shortcomings of prior amphiphilic copolymers.

     alt="Alternatives to Styrene- and Diisobutylene-Based Copolymers for Membrane Protein Solubilization via Nanodisc Formation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Styrene- and diisobutylene-based amphiphilic copolymers are invaluable tools for the extraction of integral membrane proteins. However, they have several issues that limit their efficacy and applicability. A tailorable polymeric platform is now introduced that overcomes many of these limitations, including having low UV absorbance, high protein extraction yields, and retention of native-like protein structure, as well as being readily synthesized.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Dispersion of Rhodium Clusters into Isolated Single Atoms at Low Temperature and the Consequences for CO Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh clusters undergo partial dispersion upon exposure to oxygen at room temperature. The extent of dispersion increases at higher temperatures and is higher for smaller clusters. The dispersed Rh single atoms show two orders of magnitude higher activity than nanoparticles.







Abstract
Understanding the dynamic structural evolution of supported metal clusters under reaction conditions is crucial to develop structure reactivity relations. Here, we followed the structure of different size Rh clusters supported on Al2O3 using in situ/operando spectroscopy and ex situ aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy. We report a dynamic evolution of rhodium clusters into thermally stable isolated single atoms upon exposure to oxygen and during CO oxidation. Rh clusters partially disperse into single atoms at room temperature and the extent of dispersion increases as the Rh size decreases and as the reaction temperature increases. A strong correlation is found between the extent of dispersion and the CO oxidation kinetics. More importantly, dispersing Rh clusters into single atoms increases the activity at room temperature by more than two orders of magnitude due to the much lower activation energy on single atoms (40 vs. 130&#8197;kJ/mol). This work demonstrates that the structure and reactivity of small Rh clusters are very sensitive to the reaction environment.

         <title>Molecular Stacking and Aggregation Optimization of Photoactive Layer through Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally similar analogues of ADT and NDT are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer for organic solar cells. It is found that the molecular packing behaviors and volatilization of solid additive show significant impact in regulating the morphological properties of photoactive layer, and thus photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
Regulating molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer is a critical but challenging issue in developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Herein, two structurally similar analogues of anthra[2,3&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (ADT) and naphtho[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (NDT) are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer. We clarify that the perpendicular arrangements of NDT can enlarge the molecular packing space and improve the face&#8208;on stacking of Y6 during the film formation, favoring a more compact and ordered long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction after the removal of NDT under thermal annealing. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked herringbone&#8208;arrangement of ADT along with its non&#8208;volatilization under thermal annealing can induce the coexistence of face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on stacking of blend film. As a result, the NDT treatment shows encouraging effect in improving the photovoltaic performance of devices based on various systems. Particularly, a remarkable PCE of 18.85&#8201;% is achieved in the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated by NDT additive, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 16.41&#8201;% for the control device. This work offers a promising strategy to regulate the molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer towards significantly improved performance and stability of organic solar cells.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Microcapsules Harnessing the COVID&#8208;19 Immune Response for Cancer Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vector&#8208;functionalized lentivirus&#8208;loaded DNA tetrahedra&#8208;modified stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogel microcapsules act as active carriers for gene expression in cancer cells and immunogenetic therapy of cancer cells. This is exemplified by designing Alpha&#8208;fetoprotein (AFP)&#8208;aptamer or miRNA&#8208;responsive carriers, expressing green fluorescence protein and the AFP&#8208;stimulated expression of the spike protein, harnessing the COVID&#8208;19 immune response for cancer therapy.







Abstract
The combination of gene therapy and immunotherapy concepts, along recent advances in DNA nanotechnology, have the potential to provide important tools for cancer therapies. We present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive microcapsules, loaded with a viral immunogenetic agent, harnessing the immune response against the Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID&#8208;19, to selectively attack liver cancer cells (hepatoma) or recognize breast cancer or hepatoma, by expression of green fluorescence protein, GFP. The pH&#8208;responsive microcapsules, modified with DNA&#8208;tetrahedra nanostructures, increased hepatoma permeation by 50&#8201;%. Incorporation of a GFP&#8208;encoding lentivirus vector inside the tumor&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;stimulated miRNA&#8208;triggered and Alpha&#8208;fetoprotein&#8208;dictated microcapsules enables the demonstration of neoplasm selectivity, with approximately 5,000&#8208;, 8,000&#8208; and 50,000&#8208;fold more expression in the cancerous cells, respectively. The incorporation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in the gene vector promotes specific recognition of the immune&#8208;evading hepatoma by the COVID&#8208;19&#8208;analogous immune response, which leads to cytotoxic and inflammatory activity, mediated by serum components taken from vaccinated or recovered COVID&#8208;19 patients, resulting in effective elimination of the hepatoma (&gt;85&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Catalytic Photochemical Deracemization via Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical deracemization offers a unique opportunity to directly obtain enantiopure compounds from their racemates. Short&#8208;lived intermediates play a key role in the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. The review covers comprehensively the research performed in the area and discusses current developments.







Abstract
Upon irradiation in the presence of a suitable chiral catalyst, racemic compound mixtures can be converted into enantiomerically pure compounds with the same constitution. The process is called photochemical deracemization and involves the formation of short&#8208;lived intermediates. By opening different reaction channels for the forward reaction to the intermediate and for the re&#8208;constitution of the chiral molecule, the entropically disfavored process becomes feasible. Since the discovery of the first photochemical deracemization in 2018, the field has been growing rapidly. This review comprehensively covers the research performed in the area and discusses current developments. It is subdivided according to the mode of action and the respective substrate classes. The focus of this review is on the scope of the individual reactions and on a discussion of the mechanistic details underlying the presented reaction.

A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host have been prepared and used to stain living cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging for the first time. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells indicate the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.







Abstract
Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady&#8208;state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA&#8208;UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic host has been synthesised. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long&#8208;lived anti&#8208;Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure. Our TTA&#8208;UC NPs are highly promising stains for lifetime imaging microscopy, affording excellent image contrast and potential for oxygen mapping that is ripe for further exploitation.

         <title>Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable and self&#8208;healable liquid crystal elastomer actuator was synthesized by integrating dynamic halogen bonds into an Aza&#8211;Michael addition&#8208;based elastomer network. The obtained LCE not only exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing properties without destroying the liquid crystalline alignment but also allows for dynamic shape programming and corresponding soft robotic demonstrations.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;changing polymeric materials have gained significant attention in the field of bioinspired soft robotics. However, challenges remain in versatilizing the shape&#8208;morphing process to suit different tasks and environments, and in designing systems that combine reversible actuation and self&#8208;healing ability. Here, we report halogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that can be arbitrarily shape&#8208;programmed and that self&#8208;heal under mild thermal or photothermal stimulation. We incorporate halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating diiodotetrafluorobenzene molecules as dynamic supramolecular crosslinks into the LCEs and show that these relatively weak crosslinks are pertinent for their mechanical programming and self&#8208;healing. Utilizing the halogen&#8208;bonded LCEs, we demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept soft robotic motions such as crawling and rolling with programmed velocities. Our results showcase halogen bonding as a promising, yet unexplored tool for the preparation of smart supramolecular constructs for the development of advanced soft actuators.

         <title>A General Strategy Toward pH&#8208;Resistant Phenolic Fluorophores for High&#8208;Fidelity Sensing and Bioimaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the polar and acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH and medium&#8208;dependent emission signals, which complicates bioimaging experimental design and reduces the data reliability. We developed a single&#8208;step functionalization that makes phenolic fluorophores pH and medium&#8208;resistant. The new fluorophores can be used for high&#8208;fidelity sensing and bioimaging applications.







Abstract
Aryl alcohol&#8208;type or phenolic fluorophores offer diverse opportunities for developing bioimaging agents and fluorescence probes. Due to the inherently acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH&#8208;dependent emission signals. Therefore, except for developing pH probes, the pH&#8208;dependent nature of phenolic fluorophores should be considered in bioimaging applications but has been neglected. Here we show that a simple structural remedy converts conventional phenolic fluorophores into pH&#8208;resistant derivatives, which also offer &#8220;medium&#8208;resistant&#8221; emission properties. The structural modification involves a single&#8208;step introduction of a hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor such as morpholine nearby the phenolic hydroxyl group, which also leads to emission bathochromic shift, increased Stokes shift, enhanced photo&#8208;stability and stronger emission for several dyes. The strategy greatly expands the current fluorophores&#8217; repertoire for reliable bioimaging applications, as demonstrated here with ratiometric imaging of cells and tissues.

         <title>Lithium Bis(oxalate)borate Additive for Self&#8208;repairing Zincophilic Solid Electrolyte Interphases towards Ultrahigh&#8208;rate and Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the environment&#8208;patrolling behavior of biological dendrite cells for pathogen inactivation, a dynamic patrolling system targeted to cycling&#8208;induced defects of solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes. Owing to the self&#8208;repairing feature of zincophilic SEI empowered by lithium bis(oxalate)borate additive, Zn anode presents an impressive lifespan up to 1800&#8197;h at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, attaining a fabulous cumulative capacity of 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in Zn anode stabilization but its long&#8208;term effectiveness at high rates is still challenged. Herein, to achieve superior long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate Zn anode, an exquisite electrolyte additive, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), is proposed to in situ derive a highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI and to dynamically patrol its cycling&#8208;initiated defects. Profiting from the as&#8208;constructed real&#8208;time, automatic SEI repairing mechanism, the Zn anode can be cycled with distinct reversibility over 1800&#8197;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, presenting a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity up to 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO2 and Zn||NaV3O8 full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500&#8197;cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy sources.

         <title>An Aqueous Redox Flow Battery Using CO2 as an Active Material with a Homogeneous Ir Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) system using CO2 as an active material with a homogeneous Ir catalyst. The RFB exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis using an on&#8208;line setup showed the high valence state of IrIV worked as active species.







Abstract
For the application of CO2 as an energy storage material, a H2 storage system has been proposed based on the interconversion of CO2 and formic acid (or formate). However, energy losses are inevitable in the conversion of electrical energy to H2 as chemical energy (&#8776;70&#8201;% electrical efficiency) and H2 to electrical energy (&#8776;40&#8201;% electrical efficiency). To overcome these significant energy losses, we developed a system based on the interconversion of CO2 and formate for the direct storage and generation of electricity. In this paper, we report an aqueous redox flow battery system using homogeneous Ir catalysts with CO2&#8208;formate redox pair. The system exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. During charging&#8208;discharging, in situ fluorescence X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy based on an online setup indicated that the active species was in a high valence state of IrIV.

         <title>Exploiting the Use of the Decarboxylative S&#8208;Alkylation Reaction to Produce Self&#8208;Blowing, Recyclable Polycarbonate Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;blown polycarbonate foam was prepared by exploiting the use of decarboxylative S&#8208;alkylation to generate CO2 in situ.







Abstract
Polymeric foams are widely used in many industrial applications due to their light weight and superior thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Currently, increasing research efforts is being directed towards the development of greener foam formulations that circumvent the use of isocyanates/blowing agents that are commonly used in the production of foam materials. Here, a straightforward, one&#8208;pot method is presented to prepare self&#8208;blown polycarbonate (PC) foams by exploiting the (decarboxylative) S&#8208;alkylation reaction for in situ generation of the blowing agent (CO2). The concomitant formation of a reactive alcohol intermediate promotes a cascade ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonates to yield a cross&#8208;linked polymer network. It is shown that these hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized polycarbonate&#8208;based foams can be easily recycled into films through thermal compression molding. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that complete hydrolytic degradation of the foams is possible, thus offering the potential for zero&#8208;waste materials. This straightforward and versatile process broadens the scope of isocyanate&#8208;free, self&#8208;foaming materials, opening a new pathway for next&#8208;generation environmentally friendly foams.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Cleavage of Lignin Models by a Soluble Perylene Diimide/Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene diimide (PDI) S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst selectively cleaves the C&#8722;C bond of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Rigid polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) enhances organic solvent solubility and inhibits agglomeration of the PDI. Synergy between POSS and S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions enables efficient dispersion of POSS&#8208;PDI on a carbon nitride surface for better solar utilization and accelerated charge separation.







Abstract
3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PDI) is one of the best n&#8208;type organic semiconductors and an ideal light&#8208;driven catalyst for lignin depolymerization. However, the charge localization effect and the excessively strong intermolecular aggregation trend in PDI result in rapid electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8722;h+) recombination, which limits photocatalytic performance. Herein, polymeric carbon nitride/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane PDI (p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by the solvent evaporation&#8208;deposition method for C&#8722;C bond selective cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Based on the material characterization results, the synergic role of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction maintains appropriate aggregation domains, achieves better solar light utilization, faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, and greater redox capacity. Notably, the 3&#8201;% p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI heterostructure exhibits a remarkable enhancement in cleavage conversion efficiency, achieving approximately 16.42 and 2.57 times higher conversion rates compared to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane modified PDI (POSS&#8208;PDI) and polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN), respectively.

         <title>Motorized Photomodulator: Making A Non&#8208;photoresponsive Supramolecular Gel Switchable by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a molecular motor as a photoswitchable cross&#8208;linker that co&#8208;assembles with a non&#8208;photoresponsive gelator enables reversible control over gel and solution states. This has led to a typical H&#8208;bond&#8208;based gel system that has the ability to respond to light irradiation, with creation of a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition.







Abstract
Introducing photo&#8208;responsive molecules offers an attractive approach for remote and selective control and dynamic manipulation of material properties. However, it remains highly challenging how to use a minimal amount of photo&#8208;responsive units to optically modulate materials that are inherently inert to light irradiation. Here we show the application of a light&#8208;driven rotary molecular motor as a &#8220;motorized photo&#8208;modulator&#8221; to endow a typical H&#8208;bond&#8208;based gel system with the ability to respond to light irradiation and create a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition. The key molecular design feature is the introduction of a minimal amount (2&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of molecular motors into the supramolecular network as photo&#8208;switchable non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers. Advantage is taken of the subtle interplay of the large geometry change during photo&#8208;isomerization of the molecular motor guest and the dynamic nature of a supramolecular gel host system. As a result, a tiny amount of molecular motors is enough to switch the mechanical modulus of the entire supramolecular systems. This study proves the concept of designing photo&#8208;responsive materials with minimum use of non&#8208;covalent light&#8208;absorbing units.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sodium single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) enables high rate capability and stable cycling of Na&#8214;Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% and a capacity retention of more than 84&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered a potential alternative to high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high reactivity of metallic sodium towards common liquid organic electrolytes renders such battery technology particularly challenging. Herein, we propose a multi&#8208;block single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) doped with ethylene carbonate as suitable electrolyte system for SMBs. This novel SIPE provides a very high ionic conductivity (2.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and an electrochemical stability window of about 4.1&#8197;V at 40&#8201;&#176;C, enabling stable sodium stripping and plating and excellent rate capability of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells up to 2&#8197;C. Remarkably, such cells provide a capacity retention of about 85&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C thanks to the very high Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%), resulting from an excellent interfacial stability towards sodium metal and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.

         <title>Boosting the Proton&#8208;coupled Electron Transfer via Fe&#8722;P Atomic Pair for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS, operando XAFS measurements, and DFT calculations revealed that Fe1&#8208;P/NG accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process of CO2 electroreduction by promoting the dissociation of water over the P sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalytic activity, but poor kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps still limit the overall performance toward the industrial scale. Here, we constructed a Fe&#8722;P atom paired catalyst onto nitrogen doped graphitic layer (Fe1/PNG) to accelerate PCET step. Fe1/PNG delivers an industrial CO current of 1&#8197;A with FECO over 90&#8201;% at 2.5&#8197;V in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly, overperforming the CO current of Fe1/NG by more than 300&#8201;%. We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8722;P atom pair using operando techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO2, and enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. This atom&#8208;pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8722;P atom pair using &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and enhancing the activity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. This atom-pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single-atom catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Spatially Programmable DNA Nanorobot Arm to Modulate Anisotropic Gold Nanoparticle Assembly by Enzymatic Excision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports a spatially programmable enzymatic nanorobot arm to modulate the anisotropic assembly of DNA/AuNP superstructures. By specifically controlling nicking excisions on the AuNP surfaces, DNA modifications were generated on a single nanoparticle, thus facilitating anisotropic AuNP assembly. The SPEE strategy is extended to DNA origami surfaces to establish a AuNP assembly platform in a programmable spatially regulated manner.







Abstract
Programmable assembly of gold nanoparticle superstructures with precise spatial arrangement has drawn much attention for their unique characteristics in plasmonics and biomedicine. Bio&#8208;inspired methods have already provided programmable, molecular approaches to direct AuNP assemblies using biopolymers. The existing methods, however, predominantly use DNA as scaffolds to directly guide the AuNP interactions to produce intended superstructures. New paradigms for regulating AuNP assembly will greatly enrich the toolbox for DNA&#8208;directed AuNP manipulation and fabrication. Here, we developed a strategy of using a spatially programmable enzymatic nanorobot arm to modulate anisotropic DNA surface modifications and assembly of AuNPs. Through spatial controls of the proximity of the reactants, the locations of the modifications were precisely regulated. We demonstrated the control of the modifications on a single 15&#8197;nm AuNP, as well as on a rectangular DNA origami platform, to direct unique anisotropic AuNP assemblies. This method adds an alternative enzymatic manipulation to DNA&#8208;directed AuNP superstructure assembly.

         <title>Degradable and Recyclable Polyesters from Multiple Chain Length Bio&#8208; and Waste&#8208;Sourceable Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters derived from multiple chain length dicarboxylate feedstocks, as obtained from valorization of waste polyethylene or oxidation of bio&#8208;based fatty acids, exhibit high density polyethylene&#8208;like properties, are ductile materials processable into films and fibers, and can be depolymerized enabling chemical recycling or biodegradation in the environment.







Abstract
Monomers sourced from waste or biomass are often mixtures of different chain lengths; e.g. catalytic oxidation of polyethylene waste yields mixtures of dicarboxylic acids (DCAs). Yet, polyesters synthesized from such monomer mixtures have rarely been studied. We report polyesters based on multiple linear aliphatic DCAs, present in chain length distributions that vary in their centers and ranges. We demonstrate that these materials can adopt high&#8208;density polyethylene&#8208;like solid state structures, and are ductile (e.g. Et 610&#8197;MPa), allowing for injection molding, or film and fiber extrusion. Melting and crystallization points of the polyesters show no odd&#8208;even effects as dipoles cannot favorably align in the crystal, similar to traditional odd carbon numbered, long&#8208;chain DCA polyesters. Biodegradation studies of 13C&#8208;labelled polyesters in soil reveal rapid mineralization, and depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

         <title>Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing for the Detection of MicroRNAs: Towards Liquid Biopsy on a Chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementation of point of care (PoC) devices for miRNA detection in clinical oncology is urgently needed. Here, the main field of applications and the most promising biosensing platforms for sensitive miRNA detection are discussed. The need to establish multidisciplinary networks to boost biosensing technologies and bring them to the clinic to develop and spread PoC is also highlighted. The outlook is to improve the access to molecular diagnostics tools to all patients.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) testing is revolutionizing the healthcare sector improving patient care in daily hospital practice and allowing reaching even remote geographical areas. In the frame of cancer management, the design and validation of PoC enabling the non&#8208;invasive, rapid detection of cancer markers is urgently required to implement liquid biopsy in clinical practice. Therefore, focusing on stable blood&#8208;based markers with high&#8208;specificity, such as microRNAs, is of crucial importance. In this work, we highlight the potential impact of circulating microRNAs detection on cancer management and the crucial role of PoC testing devices, especially for low&#8208;income countries. A detailed discussion about the challenges that should be faced to promote the technological transfer and clinical use of these tools has been added, to provide the readers with a complete overview of potentialities and current limitations.

         <title>Retrosynthetic Analysis Applied to Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis of Four Rh(II)&#8208;Based Complexes as Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Clip&#8208;off Chemistry, a retrosynthetic analysis step based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds enables defining the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this new approach is used to synthesize four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.







Abstract
Clip&#8208;off Chemistry is a synthetic strategy that our group previously developed to obtain new molecules and materials through selective cleavage of bonds. Herein, we report recent work to expand Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by introducing into it a retrosynthetic analysis step that, based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds, enables one to define the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we have validated our new approach by synthesising and characterising four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MFI&#8208;Type Zeolite Flow Battery Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MFI&#8208;type zeolite membranes with sub&#8208;nano&#8208;straight channels effectively inhibit the migration of vanadium ions while accelerating the proton transport, which enables good flow battery performance.







Abstract
Vanadium flow battery (VFB) is one of the most reliable stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage technologies, and a membrane with high vanadium resistance and proton conductivity is essential for manufacturing high&#8208;performance VFBs. In this study, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane was fabricated from zeolite nanosheet modules, which displayed excellent vanadium resistance (0.07&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and proton conductivity (0.16&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), yielding a coulombic efficiency of 93.9&#8201;%, a voltage efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%, and an energy efficiency of 82.3&#8201;% at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The self&#8208;discharge period of a VFB equipped with 2D MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane increased up to 116.2&#8197;h, which was significantly longer than that of the commercial perfluorinated sulfonate membrane (45.9&#8197;h). Furthermore, the corresponding battery performance remained stable over 1000 cycles (&gt;1500&#8197;h) at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These findings demonstrate that 2D MFI&#8208;type membranes are promising ion&#8208;conductive membranes applicable for stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Merging Manganese and Iminium Catalysis: Selective Hydroalkenylation of Unsaturated Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones has been accomplished via synergistic HOMO and LUMO activation by means of manganese and iminium catalysis. The use of chiral organocatalysts could provide the corresponding products with moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The use of synergistic catalytic strategy can usually circumvent the intrinsic limitations of one catalytic system. In this communication, we disclose a cooperative catalysis strategy of manganese and iminium catalysis to realize selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Its success stems from the LUMO activation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds with secondary amines as the organocatalyst and the synergistic HOMO activation of alkenylboronic acids with Mn2(CO)8Br2. This protocol exhibits several synthetic advances, e.g., simple operation, good functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. The theoretical calculation indicates the migratory insertion followed by demetallation&#8208;isomerization process is kinetically more favorable than Michael&#8208;like nucleophilic addition. The use of proline&#8208;derived organocatalyst can deliver the desired products in moderate enantioselectivity.

         <title>S&#8208;Block Potassium Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalyst with K&#8722;N4 Configuration Derived from K+/Polydopamine for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An s&#8208;block Potassium single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a K&#8208;N4 configuration was prepared and used as a highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The excellent ORR activity is attributed to K/C atoms acting as dual adsorption sites, which can synergistically optimize the free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and tune the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Currently, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) research mainly focuses on transition metal atoms as active centers. Due to their delocalized s/p&#8208;bands, the s&#8208;block main group metal elements are typically regarded as catalytically inert. Herein, an s&#8208;block potassium SAC (K&#8722;N&#8722;C) with K&#8208;N4 configuration is reported for the first time, which exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability under alkaline conditions. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) is up to 0.908&#8197;V, and negligible changes in E1/2 are observed after 10,000 cycles. In addition, the K&#8722;N&#8722;C offers an exceptional power density of 158.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability up to 420&#8197;h in a Zn&#8208;air battery. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that K&#8722;N&#8722;C has bifunctional active K and C sites, can optimize the free energy of ORR reaction intermediates, and adjust the rate&#8208;determining steps. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) results showed that the s orbitals of K played a major role in the adsorption of intermediates, which was different from the d orbitals in transition metals. This work significantly guides the rational design and catalytic mechanism research of s&#8208;block SACs with high ORR activity.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Cobalt/Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysts for Synergistically Boosting Hydrogen Generation from Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed N&#8208;coordinated Co/Cu dual&#8208;metal sites were designed and constructed for improved dehydrogenation of formic acid. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the Co/Cu dual&#8208;metal sites synergistically improve the performance of the optimized catalytic system. The presented work describes catalysts based on low&#8208;cost earth abundant dual&#8208;metal sites as promising candidates for H2 storage and delivery.







Abstract
The development of practical materials for (de)hydrogenation reactions is a prerequisite for the launch of a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, we present the design and construction of an atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal site Co/Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst allowing significantly improved dehydrogenation of formic acid, which is available from carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. The active catalyst centers consist of specific CoCuN6 moieties with double&#8208;N&#8208;bridged adjacent metal&#8208;N4 clusters decorated on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support. At optimal conditions the dehydrogenation performance of the nanostructured material (mass activity 77.7&#8197;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) is up to 40&#8197;times higher compared to commercial 5&#8201;% Pd/C. In situ spectroscopic and kinetic isotope effect experiments indicate that Co/Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C promoted formic acid dehydrogenation follows the so&#8208;called formate pathway with the C&#8722;H dissociation of HCOO* as the rate&#8208;determining step. Theoretical calculations reveal that Cu in the CoCuN6 moiety synergistically contributes to the adsorption of intermediate HCOO* and raises the d&#8208;band center of Co to favor HCOO* activation and thereby lower the reaction energy barrier.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Induced Radical&#8208;Radical Heterocoupling Boosts Photodriven Oxidative Esterification of Benzyl Alcohol over Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co@NC catalyst combined the action of localized surface&#8208;plasmon resonance (LSPR) and photothermal conversion to deliver high reaction rates and selectivity for the oxidation of alcohols to esters under base&#8208;free conditions. The catalytic activity increased by a factor of 7.8 compared with that under direct heating.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of alcohols under mild conditions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in the bulk and fine chemical industry, which usually requires environmentally unfriendly oxidants and bases that are difficult to separate. Here, a plasmonic catalyst of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Co nanoparticles (Co@NC) with an excellent catalytic activity towards selective oxidation of alcohols is demonstrated. With light as only energy input, the plasmonic Co@NC catalyst effectively operates via combining action of the localized surface&#8208;plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the photothermal effects to achieve a factor of 7.8&#8197;times improvement compared with the activity of thermocatalysis. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of 15.6&#8197;h&#8722;1 is obtained under base&#8208;free conditions, which surpasses all the reported catalytic performances of thermocatalytic analogues in the literature. Detailed characterization reveals that the d states of metallic Co gain the absorbed light energy, so the excitation of interband d&#8208;to&#8208;s transitions generates energetic electrons. LSPR&#8208;mediated charge injection to the Co@NC surface activates molecular oxygen and alcohol molecules adsorbed on its surface to generate the corresponding radical species (e.g., &#8901;O2&#8722;, CH3O&#8901; and R&#8208;&#8901;CH&#8208;OH). The formation of multi&#8208;type radical species creates a direct and forward pathway of oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol to speed up the production of esters.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, economical, and direct approach to access &#945;,&#946;&#8208;deuterated styrene compounds via triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;mediated electrochemical deuteration of styrenes and derivatives through electrochemical deuterium atom transfer (eDAT) has been developed. This approach tolerated a wide range of styrenes and 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes, and the extension to late stage deuteration of complex molecules and their derivatives showed a potential prospect.







Abstract
Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition&#8208;metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D&#8208;incorporation (D&#8208;inc, up to &gt;99&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiments and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late&#8208;stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.

&lt;p&gt;A general, economical, and direct approach to access &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-deuterated styrene compounds via triphenylphosphine (TPP)-mediated electrochemical deuteration of styrenes and derivatives through electrochemical deuterium atom transfer (eDAT) has been developed. This approach tolerated a wide range of styrenes and 1-phenyl-1,3-dienes, and the extension to late stage deuteration of complex molecules and their derivatives showed a potential prospect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition-metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D-incorporation (D-inc, up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiments and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late-stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Promoted Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage Employing a Reusable Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and robust nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits highly selective C&#8722;C/C=C bond cleavage reactivity in the presence of air (O2) and water (H2O) under comparably mild conditions. The present atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N sites can efficiently activate O2 and H2O to generate singlet 1O2 and hydroxide species, which take selectively part in the C&#8722;C bond cleavage and lead to a significant promotion in activity.







Abstract
The development of methods for selective cleavage reactions of thermodynamically stable C&#8722;C/C=C bonds in a green manner is a challenging research field which is largely unexplored. Herein, we present a heterogeneous Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with highly dispersed iron centers that allows for the oxidative C&#8722;C/C=C bond cleavage of amines, secondary alcohols, ketones, and olefins in the presence of air (O2) and water (H2O). Mechanistic studies reveal the presence of water to be essential for the performance of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C system, boosting the product yield from &lt;1&#8201;% to &gt;90&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and control experiments suggest the singlet 1O2 and hydroxide species generated from O2 and H2O, respectively, take selectively part in the C&#8722;C bond cleavage. The broad applicability (&gt;40 examples) even for complex drugs as well as high activity, selectivity, and durability under comparably mild conditions highlight this unique catalytic system.

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks with well&#8208;organized low&#8208;dimensional architectures provide significant thermodynamic and/or kinetic benefits for diverse applications. We present here the controlled synthesis of a novel class of hierarchical zirconium&#8208;porphyrin frameworks (ZrPHPs) with nanosheet&#8208;assembled hexagonal prism morphology. The crystal growth behaviors and structural evolution of ZrPHPs in an additive&#8208;modulated hydrothermal synthesis are examined, showing an &#8220;assembly&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;reassembly&#8221; mechanism towards the formation of 2D nanosheets with ordered arrangement. Because of the highly&#8208;accessible active sites harvesting broadband photons, ZrPHPs serve as adaptable photocatalysts to regulate macromolecular synthesis under full&#8208;range visible light and natural sunlight. An initiator&#8208;free, oxygen&#8208;tolerant photopolymerization system is established, following a distinctive mechanism involving direct photo&#8208;induced electron transfer to dormant species and hole&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation. Specifically, ZrPHPs provides a surface&#8208;confined effect towards the propagating chains which inhibits their recombination termination, enabling the highly&#8208;efficient synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight polymers (Mn &gt; 1,500,000) with relatively low dispersity (&#272; ~ 1.5).</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Uniform DNA Monolayers Generated by Freezing&#8208;Directed Assembly on Gold Surfaces Enable Robust Electrochemical Sensing in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assembling DNA on solid surfaces is fundamental to surface&#8208;based DNA technology. However, precise control over DNA conformation and organization at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces remains a challenge, resulting in limited stability and sensitivity in biosensing applications. We herein communicate a simple and robust method for creating highly uniform DNA monolayers on gold surfaces by a freeze&#8208;thawing process. Using Raman spectroscopy, fluorescent imaging, and square wave voltammetry, we demonstrate that thiolated DNA is concentrated and immobilized on gold surfaces with an upright conformation. Moreover, our results reveal that the freezing&#8208;induced DNA surfaces are more uniform, leading to improved DNA stability and target recognition. Lastly, we demonstrate the successful detection of a model drug in undiluted whole blood while mitigating the effects of biofouling. Our work not only provides a simple approach to tailor the DNA&#8208;gold surface for biosensors but also sheds light on the unique behavior of DNA oligonucleotides upon freezing on the liquid&#8208;solid interface.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The pharmacokinetics of pharmaceutical drugs can be improved by replacing C&#8211;H bonds with the more stable C&#8211;D bonds at the alpha&#8208;position to heteroatoms, which is a typical metabolic site for CYP.

Herein, we established a novel concept for preparing breakthrough deuterated reagents for the successful synthesis of complicated drug skeletons with deuterium atoms at the alpha&#8208;position to heteroatoms. (dn&#8208;Alkyl)diphenylsulfonium salts (1&#8208;dn), prepared from the corresponding nondeuterated forms using inexpensive and abundant D2O as the deuterium source with base, were used as electrophilic alkylating reagents. Additionally, 1&#8208;dn was efficiently transformed into dn&#8208;alkylazide/halides as coupling partners and dn&#8208;alkylamine as nucleophiles. Furthermore, liver microsomal metabolism studys revealed deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE) in 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework to Upgrade Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborately designed multifunctional electrocatalysts capable of promoting Li+ and CO2 transport are essential for upgrading the cycling stability and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with open channels and easily functionalized surfaces hold great potential for applications in efficient cathodes of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, a robust HOFS (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) is introduced for the first time as a co&#8208;catalyst in the cathode material of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with cyano groups located periodically in the pore can induce homogeneous deposition of discharge products and accommodate volumetric expansion of discharge products during cycling. Besides, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 enables effective interaction between Ru0 nanoparticles and cyano groups, thus forming efficient and uniform catalytic sites for CRR/CER. Moreover, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with regularly arranged open channels are beneficial for CO2 and Li+ transport, enabling rapid redox kinetic conversion of CO2. Therefore, the HOF&#8208;based Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are capable of stable operation at 400 mA g&#8208;1 for 1800 h and maintain a low overpotential of 1.96 V even at high current densities up to 5 A g&#8208;1. This work provides valuable guidance for developing multifunctional HOF&#8208;based catalysts to upgrade the longevity and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of a Pyrene&#8208;substituted Diamide and its Ensemble of Kinetically Trapped Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevalence of kinetically accessible states in supramolecular polymerization pathways has been exploited to control the growth of the polymer and thereby to obtain niche morphologies. Yet, these pathways themselves are not easily amenable for experimental delineation but could potentially be understood through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Herein, we report an extensive investigation of the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;substituted diamide (PDA) monomers in solution, conducted using atomistic MD simulations and advanced sampling methods. We characterize such kinetic and thermodynamic states, as well as the transition pathways and free energy barriers between them. PDA forms a dimeric segment with the N&#8208; to C&#8208;termini vectors of the diamide moieties arranged either in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel fashion. This characteristic, combined with the molecule&#8217;s torsional flexibility and pyrene&#8208;solvent interactions, presents an ensemble of molecular configurations contributing to the kinetic state in the polymerization pathway. While this ensemble primarily comprises short oligomers containing a mix of anti&#8208;parallel and parallel dimeric segments, the thermodynamic state of the assembly is a right&#8208;handed polymer featuring parallel ones alone. Our work thus offers an approach by which the landscape of any specific supramolecular polymerization can be deconstructed.</dc:description>

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed with identification of bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) to play a dual role: efficient Lewis acid and source of bromide nucleophile. This work represents a novel and efficient approach for the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo [3.3.1] nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform in the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products or drug molecules. The substrate scope was investigated with 27 successful examples that employ 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes as diverse substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization with good to excellent yields. Finally, we showcased the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total syntheses of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in total 9&#8208;14 steps. This work significantly expands the synthetic utility of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring and Improvement of Cs2NaHoCl6 Cryolite Crystals via Sb3+/Yb3+ Alloying for Versatile Photoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites are currently gaining significant attention owing to their exceptional environmental friendliness, structural adjustability as well as self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. However, stable and efficient double perovskite with multimode luminescence and tunable spectra are still urgently needed for multifunctional photoelectric application. Herein, holmium based cryolite materials (Cs2NaHoCl6) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence were successfully synthesized. By the further alloying of Sb3+ (s&#8208;p transitions) and Yb3+ (f&#8208;f transitions) ions, its luminescence properties can be well modulated, originating from tailoring band gap structure and enriching electron transition channels. Upon Sb3+ substitution in Cs2NaHoCl6, additional absorption peaking at 334 nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Meanwhile, not only the typical NIR emission around 980 nm of Ho3+ is enhanced, but also the red and NIR emissions show a diverse range of anti&#8208;thermal quenching photoluminescence behaviors. Furthermore, through designing Yb3+&#160;doping, the up&#8208;conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange) and Yb3+ doping concentration (red&#8208;to&#8208;green). Through a combined experimental&#8208;theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb3+/Yb3+&#160;in Cs2NaHoCl6, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Dioxygenation of alkenes leads to a structural motif ubiquitous in organic synthons, natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Straightforward and green synthesis protocols starting from abundant raw materials are required for facile and sustainable access to these crucial moieties. Especially industrially abundant aliphatic alkenes have proven to be arduous substrates in sustainable 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation methods. Here, we report a highly efficient electrocatalytic diacetoxylation of alkenes under ambient conditions using a simple iodobenzene mediator and acetic acid as both the solvent and an atom&#8208;efficient reactant. This transition metal&#8208;free method is applicable to a wide range of alkenes, even challenging feedstock alkenes such as ethylene and propylene, with a broad functional group tolerance and excellent faradaic efficiencies up to 87%. In addition, this protocol can be extrapolated to alkenoic acids, resulting in cyclization of the starting materials to valuable lactone derivatives. With aromatic alkenes, a competing mechanism of direct anodic oxidation exists which enables reaction under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic method is extensively investigated with cyclic voltammetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Frontier Molecular Orbital Engineering: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is of great strategic significance to develop highly efficient narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be utilized to manufacture ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays and meet or approach the requirements of Broadcast Television 2020 (B.T.2020) color gamut standards. This motif poses challenges for molecular design and synthesis, especially for developing generality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular structures. The emergence of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters has ingeniously solved the problems and demonstrated bright application prospects in the field of UHD displays, sparking a research boom. This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, with emphasis on the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) strategy. It combines the outstanding advantages of MR framework and donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, and can achieve red&#8208;shift and narrowband emission simultaneously, which is of great significance in the development of long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters with emission maxima especially exceeding 500 nm. We hope that this Minireview would provide some inspiration for what could transpire in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbene Relay Strategy for Cascade Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion reactions that involve stabilized electrophilic metallocarbenes are of great importance for installing &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms to carbonyl compounds. Nevertheless, the limited availability of carbene precursors restricts the introduction of only a single heteroatom. In this report, we describe a new approach based on an I(III)/S(VI) reagent that promotes the cascade insertion of heteroatoms. This is achieved by sequentially generating two &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted metal carbenes in one reaction. We found that this mixed I(III)/S(VI) ylide reacts efficiently with a transition metal catalyst and an X&#8208;H bond (where X = O, N). This transformation leads to the sequential formation of a sulfoxonium&#8208; and an X&#8208;substituted Rh&#8208;carbenes, enabling further reactions with another Y&#8208;H. Remarkably, a wide range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,O&#8208;, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,N&#8208;, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;N,N&#8208;subsituted ketones can be prepared under mild ambient conditions. In addition, we successfully demonstrated other cascades, such as CN/CN double amidation, C&#8208;H/C&#8208;S double insertion, and C&#8208;S/Y&#8208;H double insertion (where Y = S, N, O, C). Notably, the latter two cascades enabled the simultaneous installation of three functional groups to the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyl compounds in a single step. These reactions demonstrate the versatility of our approach, allowing for the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms using a common precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective De Novo Synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diaryl Ketones from Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are structural motifs commonly present in bioactive molecules, and they are also valuable building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones bearing a tertiary stereogenic center remains largely unsolved. Herein, we report a catalytic de novo enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from simple alkynes via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A broad range of enolizable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are prepared in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The described protocol also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology reported, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8211;Temperature&#8211;Transformation (TTT) Diagram of Battery&#8208;Grade Li&#8208;Garnet Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Temperature Sustainable Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and affordable synthesis of Li+ functional ceramics is crucial for the scalable production of solid electrolytes for batteries. Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8722;d (LLZO), especially its cubic phase (cLLZO), attracts attention due to its high Li+ conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. However, high sintering temperatures raise concerns about the cathode interface stability, production costs, and energy consumption for scalable manufacture. We show an alternative &#8220;sinter&#8208;free&#8221; route to stabilize cLLZO as films at half of its sinter temperature. Specifically, we establish a time&#8211;temperature&#8211;transformation (TTT) diagram which captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirm stabilization of thin&#8208;film cLLZO at record low temperatures of 500 &#176;C. Our findings pave the way for low&#8208;temperature processing via TTT diagrams, which can be used for battery cell design targeting reduced carbon footprints in manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Stress&#8208;strain in Barium Titanate Piezocatalysts Enabling Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Batteries with Low Overpotential and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising candidates for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, whereas their commercial application is hindered due to poor cyclic stability caused by the sluggish kinetics and cathode passivation. Herein, the intrinsic stress originated from the growth and decomposition of the discharge product (lithium peroxide, Li2O2) is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to induce the built&#8208;in electric field, further improving the reaction kinetics and interfacial Lithium ion (Li+) transport during cycling. Piezopotential caused by the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain of solid Li2O2 is capable of providing the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, enhancing the Li+ transfer, and thus improving the redox reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Combined with a variety of in situ characterizations, the catalytic mechanism of barium titanate (BTO), a typical piezoelectric material, was systematically investigated, and the effect of stress&#8208;strain transformation on the electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li+ interface transport for the Li&#8722;O2 batteries is clearly established. The findings provide deep insight into the surface coupling strategy between intrinsic stress and electric fields to regulate the electrochemical reaction kinetics behavior and enhance the interfacial Li+ transport for battery system.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Enamides or Enecarbamates with Racemic &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic methods which control multiple stereogenic centers simultaneously are highly desirable in modern organic synthesis and chemical manufacturing. Herein, we report a regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation process which proceeds with simultaneous control of vicinal stereocenters originating from two readily accessible partners, prochiral internal alkenes (enamides or enecarbamates) and racemic alkyl electrophiles (&#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts). This reaction produces high&#8208;value &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives under mild conditions and with precise selectivity. Preliminary studies of the mechanism indicate that the reaction involves an enantioselective syn&#8208;hydronickelation to generate an enantiomerically enriched alkylnickel(II) species. Subsequent enantioconvergent alkylation with a racemic alkyl electrophile generates the desired product as a single stereoisomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aminomethylation of Alkyl Halides Enabled by Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling of alkyl halides and tertiary amines offers a promising tool for the rapid decoration of amine skeletons. However, this approach has not been well established, partially due to the challenges in precisely distinguishing and controlling the reactivity of amine&#8208;coupling partners and their product homologues. Herein, we developed a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system for the aminomethylation of alkyl halides through radical&#8208;involved C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond formation, allowing for the synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines that are of interest in organic synthesis but not easily prepared by other methods. Mechanistic studies disclosed that sterically hindered N&#8208;substituents are key to activate the amine coupling partners by tuning their redox potentials to drive the reaction forward.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific modification of thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules has been recognized as a versatile and powerful strategy for probing our biological systems and discovering novel therapeutics. The addition of lipophilic silicon moiety opens up new avenues for multi&#8208;disciplinary research with broad applications in both the medicinal and material sciences. However, adhering to the strict biocompatibility requirements, and achieving the introduction of labile silicon handle and high chemo&#8208;selectivity have been formidable. In this paper, we report silicon&#8208;based conjugating reagents including &#946;&#8208;trialkylsilyl and silyl ether&#8208;tethered alkynones that selectively react with thiols under physiological conditions. The pH&#8208;neutral, metal&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free reaction yields stable products with broad substrate compatibility and full retention of silicon handles in most cases. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is applicable in the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and payloads, thereby expanding the toolbox of thiol conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photolabile Curcumin&#8208;Diazirine Analogue Enables Phototherapy with Physically and Molecularly Produced Light for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs has recently witnessed substantial achievement. To further enhance the pool of drug candidates, it is crucial to explore non&#8208;traditional therapeutic avenues. In this study, we present the use of a photolabile curcumin&#8208;diazirine analogue, CRANAD&#8208;147, to induce changes in properties, structures (sequences), and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species both in cells and in vivo. This manipulation was achieved through irradiation with LED light or molecularly generated light, dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, emitted by the chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. Next, aided by molecular chemiluminescence imaging, we demonstrated that the combination of CRANAD&#8208;147/LED or CRANAD&#8208;147/ADLumin&#8208;4 (molecular light) could effectively slow down the accumulation of A&#946;s in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo. Leveraging the remarkable tissue penetration capacity of molecular light, phototherapy employing the synergistic effect of a photolabile A&#946; ligand and molecular light emerges as a promising alternative to conventional AD treatment interventions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;driven azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch has been designed. Reversible modulation of the polarization inversion and on&#8208;off&#8208;switchable circularly polarized luminescence in a helical superstructure have also been demonstrated.







Abstract
The development of chiral optical active materials with switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals remains a challenge. Here an azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch, (S, R, S)&#8208;switch 1 and (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, are designed and prepared with an (R)&#8208;binaphthyl azo group as a chiral photosensitive moiety and two (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;binaphthyl fluorescent molecules with opposite or the same handedness as chiral fluorescent moieties. Both switches exhibit reversible trans/cis isomerization when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light and 520&#8197;nm green light in solvent and liquid crystal (LC) media. In contrast with the control (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, when switch 1 is doped into nematic LCs, polarization inversion and switching&#8208;off of the CPL signals are achieved in the resultant helical superstructure upon irradiation with 365&#8197;nm UV and 520&#8197;nm green light, respectively. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the system is basically unchanged during this switching process. In particular, these variations of the CPL signals could be recovered after heating, realizing the true sense of CPL reversible switching. Taking advantage of the unique CPL switching, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for &#8220;a dual&#8208;optical information encryption system&#8221; based on the above CPL active material is demonstrated.

         <title>Photo&#8208;thermal Cooperative Carbonylation of Ethanol with CO2 on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source into value&#8208;added esters is of considerable significance and interest, while remains of great challenge due to the harsh conditions for activation of inert CO2 in that the harsh conditions result in undesired activation of &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H and even cleavage of C&#8208;C bond in ethanol to deteriorate the specific activation of O&#8208;H bond. Herein, we propose  a photo&#8208;thermal cooperative strategy for carbonylation of ethanol with CO2, in which CO2 is activated to reactive CO via photo&#8208;catalysis with the assistance of *H from thermally&#8208;catalyzed dissociation of alcoholic O&#8208;H bond.  To achieve this proposal, an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy both abundant SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O (Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x) has been designed. A production of up to 320 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 85.6% to targeted alcoholic O&#8208;H activation has been afforded in photo&#8208;thermal assisted gas&#8208;solid process  under 3.29 W cm&#8208;1 of UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation (144 oC) and 0.2 MPa CO2. In the photo&#8208;driven activation of CO2 and following carbonylation, CO2 activation energy decreases to 12.6 kJ mol&#8208;1, and the cleavage of alcoholic &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H bond has been suppressed.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose  a photo-thermal cooperative strategy for carbonylation of ethanol with CO2, in which CO2 is activated to reactive CO via photo-catalysis with the assistance of *H from thermally-catalyzed dissociation of alcoholic O-H bond.  To achieve this proposal, an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy both abundant SrTiCuO3-x supported Cu2O (Cu2O-SrTiCuO3-x) has been designed. A production of up to 320 &#956;mol g-1 h-1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 85.6% to targeted alcoholic O-H activation has been afforded in photo-thermal assisted gas-solid process  under 3.29 W cm-1 of UV-Vis light irradiation (144 oC) and 0.2 MPa CO2.

         <title>Integrated Tandem Electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical Coupling of Biomass and Nitrate to Sustainable Alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alanine is widely employed for synthesizing polymers, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Electrocatalytic coupling of biomass molecules and waste nitrate is attractive for the nitrate removal and alanine production under ambient conditions. However, the reaction efficiency is relatively low due to the activation of the stable substrates, and the coupling of two reactive intermediates remains challenging. Herein, we realize the integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electochemical synthesis of alanine from the biomass&#8208;derived pyruvic acid (PA) and waste nitrate (NO3&#8208;) catalyzed by PdCu nano&#8208;bead&#8208;wires (PdCu NBWs). The overall reaction pathway is demonstrated as a multiple&#8208;step catalytic cascade process via coupling the reactive intermediates NH2OH and PA on the catalyst surface. Interestingly, in this integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical catalytic cascade process, Cu facilitates the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to NH2OH intermediates, which chemically couple with PA to form the pyruvic oxime, and Pd promotes the electrochemical reduction of pyruvic oxime to the desirable alanine. This work provides a green strategy to convert waste NO3&#8208; to wealth and enriches the substrate scope of renewable biomass feedstocks to produce high&#8208;value amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bismuth&#8208;Based Zeolitic Organic Framework with Coordination&#8208;Linked Metal Cages for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) have emerged as one of the most promsing catalysts for energy conversion, but they suffer from either weak bonding between metal&#8208;organic cubes (MOCs) that decrease their stability during catalysis processes or low activity due to inadequate active sites. In this work, through ligand&#8208;directing strategy, we successfully obtain an unprecedented bismuth&#8208;based ZMOF (Bi&#8208;ZMOF) featuring a ACO topological crystal structure with strong coordination bonding between the Bi&#8208;based cages. As a result, it enables efficient reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) with Faradaic efficiency as high as 91%. A combination of in&#8208;situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals that the Bi&#8208;N coordination contributes to facilitating charge transfer from N to Bi atoms, which stabilize the intermediate to boost the reduction efficiency of CO2 to HCOOH. This finding highlights the importance of the coordination environment of metal active sites on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. We believe that this work will offer a new clue to rationally design zeolitic MOFs for catalytic reaction</dc:description>

         <title>Icosidodecahedral Coordination&#8208;Saturated Cuprofullerene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Judicious selection of coordination ligands has led to the first coordination&#8208;saturated buckyball with a C60 molecule totally encased in an icosidodecahedral M30 cluster. Charge transfer from (CuI, Cl) to C60 in the triple core&#8211;shell cuprofullerene (C60@Cu30@Cl36N12) explains the light absorption up to 700&#8197;nm, and accounts for an ultrafast photophysical process that underpins its high photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
The first coordination&#8208;saturated buckyball with a C60 molecule totally encased in an icosidodecahedral Cu30 in a (&#956;30&#8208;(&#951;2)30)&#8208;fashion, namely C60@Cu30@Cl36N12, has been successfully realized by a C60&#8208;templated assembly. The 48 outmost coordinating atoms (36Cl+12N) comprise a new simple polyhedron that is described by a ccf topology. Charge transfer from (CuI, Cl) to C60 explains the expansion of the light absorption up to 700&#8197;nm, and accounts for an ultrafast photophysical process that underpins its high photothermal conversion efficiency. This work makes a giant step forward in exohedral metallofullerene (ExMF) chemistry.

         <title>Electrosynthesis and Microanalysis in Thin Layer: An Electrochemical Pipette for Rapid Electrolysis and Mechanistic Study of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin&#8208;layer approach is presented to bypass the area&#8208;volume restrictions of traditional electrolysis cells and perform minute&#8208;scale electrolysis reactions. Parallel electrolysis reactions, using multiple thin&#8208;layer electrodes (TLE), facilitate the design and study of electrosynthesis reactions. Hosting a microelectrode in the TLE provides an advanced tool for combining electroanalytical and electrosynthetic reactions.







Abstract
Electrochemistry represents unique approaches for the promotion and mechanistic study of chemical reactions and has garnered increasing attention in different areas of chemistry. This expansion necessitates the enhancement of the traditional electrochemical cells that are intrinsically constrained by mass transport limitations. Herein, we present an approach for designing an electrochemical cell by limiting the reaction chamber to a thin layer of solution, comparable to the thickness of the diffusion layer. This thin layer electrode (TLE) provides a modular platform to bypass the constraints of traditional electrolysis cells and perform electrolysis reactions in the timescale of electroanalytical techniques. The utility of the TLE for electrosynthetic applications benchmarked using NHPI&#8208;mediated electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization. The application of microscale electrolysis for the study of drug metabolites was showcased by elucidating the oxidation pathways of the paracetamol drug. Moreover, hosting a microelectrode in the TLE, was shown to enable real&#8208;time probing of the profiles of redox&#8208;active components of these rapid electrosynthesis reactions.

         <title>Adaptive Catalysts for the Selective Hydrogenation of Bicyclic Heteroaromatics using Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a CO2&#8208;Responsive Support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium nanoparticles immobilized on an amine&#8208;functionalized polymer&#8208;grafted silica material act as adaptive catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives, producing partially saturated products under H2/CO2, and fully saturated products under H2. The selectivity switch is reversible, rapid, and robust, and originates from the formation of ammonium formate species under H2/CO2, and their decomposition under H2.







Abstract
Ruthenium nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on an amine&#8208;functionalized polymer&#8208;grafted silica support act as adaptive catalysts for the hydrogenation of bicyclic heteroaromatics. Whereas full hydrogenation of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives is achieved under pure H2, introducing CO2 into the H2 gas phase leads to an effective shutdown of the arene hydrogenation while preserving the activity for the hydrogenation of the heteroaromatic part. The selectivity switch originates from the generation of ammonium formate species on the surface of the materials by catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The CO2 hydrogenation is fully reversible, resulting in a robust and rapid switch between the two states of the catalyst adapting its performance in response to the feed gas composition. A variety of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives were hydrogenated to fully or partially saturated products in high selectivity and yields simply by altering the composition of the feed gas from H2 to H2/CO2. The adaptive catalytic system thus provides controlled access to valuable products using a single catalyst rather than two specific and distinct catalysts with static reactivity.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Emulsions: A Versatile Platform for Photonics, Sensing, and Active Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal emulsions have recently opened new opportunities for the design of soft responsive materials. These recent findings have enabled a wealth of unprecedented applications in photonics (e.g. retroreflectors, lasing materials), sensing (e.g. detection of biomolecules, pathogens), soft robotics (e.g. micropumps, artificial muscles), and beyond.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystals (LCs) is a fascinating method for controlling the organization of discrete molecules into nanostructured functional materials. Although LCs are traditionally processed in thin films, their confinement within micrometre&#8208;sized droplets has recently revealed new properties and functions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation soft responsive materials. These recent findings have unlocked a wealth of unprecedented applications in photonics (e.g. reflectors, lasing materials), sensing (e.g. biomolecule and pathogen detection), soft robotics (e.g. micropumps, artificial muscles), and beyond. This Minireview focuses on recent developments in LC emulsion designs and highlights a variety of novel potential applications. Perspectives on the opportunities and new directions for implementing LC emulsions in future innovative technologies are also provided.

         <title>Effective Activation of Strong C&#8722;Cl Bonds for Highly Selective Photosynthesis of Bibenzyl via Homo&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu loaded ZnO nanoparticles exhibit robust performance in photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling of inert benzyl chloride. Compared to previously reported Cu/TiO2, the selectivity towards bibenzyl increases from 57 to 93&#8201;%. Cu loading enhances the reactant adsorption, C&#8722;Cl bond activation and charge separation/transfer. The moderate oxidation of 2&#8208;propanol by ZnO is a key factor in alleviating the generation of byproduct toluene.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling of organic halides has been successfully achieved in homogeneous catalysis, while the limitation, e.g., the dependence on rare noble metals, complexity of the metal&#8208;ligand catalylst and the poor catalyst stability and recyclability, needs to be tackled for a green process. The past few years have witnessed heterogeneous photocatalysis as a green and novel method for organic synthesis processes. However, the study on C&#8722;C coupling of chloride substrates is rare due to the extremely high bond energy of C&#8722;Cl bond (327&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Here, we report a robust heterogeneous photocatalyst (Cu/ZnO) to drive the homo&#8208;coupling of benzyl chloride with high efficiency, which achieves an unprecedented high selectivity of bibenzyl (93&#8201;%) and yield rate of 92&#8201;% at room temperature. Moreover, this photocatalytic process has been validated for C&#8722;C coupling of 10 benzylic chlorides all with high yields. In addition, the excellent stability has been observed for 8 cycles of reactions. With detailed characterization and DFT calculation, the high selectivity is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of reactants, stabilization of intermediates (benzyl radicals) for the selective coupling by the Cu loading and the moderate oxidation ability of the ZnO support, besides the promoted charge separation and transfer by Cu species.

         <title>Achieving Molecular Recognition of Structural Analogues in Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: Inducing Charge and Geometry Complementarity to Mimic Molecular Docking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition of structural analogues in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy is achieved by inducing charge and geometry complementarity between 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine probe and chondroitin sulfate (CS) isomers. By &#8220;locking&#8221; each CS in a unique complex geometry via site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions, our platform mimics molecular docking events to enable high spectral specificity and multiplex quantification.







Abstract
Molecular recognition of complex isomeric biomolecules remains challenging in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy due to their small Raman cross&#8208;sections and/or poor surface affinities. To date, the use of molecular probes has achieved excellent molecular sensitivities but still suffers from poor spectral specificity. Here, we induce &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between probe and analyte as a key strategy to achieve high spectral specificity for effective SERS molecular recognition of structural analogues. We employ 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine (MPY) as the probe, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharides with isomeric sulfation patterns as our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Our experimental and in silico studies reveal that &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between MPY's binding pocket and the CS sulfation patterns drives the formation of site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions at the respective CS isomerism sites, which &#8220;locks&#8221; each CS in its analogue&#8208;specific complex geometry, akin to molecular docking events. Leveraging the resultant spectral fingerprints, we achieve &gt; 97&#8201;% classification accuracy for 4 CSs and 5 potential structural interferences, as well as attain multiplex CS quantification with &lt; 3&#8201;% prediction error. These insights could enable practical SERS differentiation of biologically important isomers to meet the burgeoning demand for fast&#8208;responding applications across various fields such as biodiagnostics, food and environmental surveillance.

         <title>Photochemical Oximesulfonylation of Alkenes Using Sulfonyl&#8208;Oxime&#8208;Ethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient metal free photochemical method for regioselective incorporation of oxime ether and sulfonyl functionality to olefin using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents is demonstrated. The process exhibits a wide range of substrate scope providing rapid access to 1,2&#8208;oximesulfonylated products in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Utilization of oxime ethers as bifunctional reagents remains unknown. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy that enables oximesulfonylation of olefins using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents under metal&#8208;free photochemical conditions. Via concomitant C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, the process permits incorporation of oxime and sulfonyl groups into olefins in a complete atom&#8208;economic fashion, providing rapid access to multi&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl oxime ethers with good yields and stereoselectivity. The method is amenable to functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and is shown to be scalable. A radical chain mechanism initiated via photochemical Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mediated N&#8722;O bond cleavage is suggested for the process, based on our results on mechanistic investigations.

         <title>Strong Protein Adhesives through Lanthanide&#8208;enhanced Structure Folding and Stack Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular engineering strategy was developed to fabricate exotic protein adhesives with ultra&#8208;strong adhesion performance, extreme&#8208;temperature resistance, and underwater stability. The lanthanide&#8208;induced conformational transition enhanced the stacking density of adhesive protein moieties, thus endowing stronger molecular interactions. This work offers a versatile approach to fabricate robust bio&#8208;adhesives with multiple desired properties.







Abstract
Generating strong adhesion by engineered proteins has the potential for high technical applications. Current studies of adhesive proteins are primarily limited to marine organisms, e.g., mussel adhesive proteins. Here, we present a modular engineering strategy to generate a type of exotic protein adhesives with super strong adhesion behaviors. In the protein complexes, the lanmodulin (LanM) underwent &#945;&#8208;helical conformational transition induced by lanthanides, thereby enhancing the stacking density and molecular interactions of adhesive protein. The resulting adhesives exhibited outstanding lap&#8208;shear strength of &#8776;31.7&#8197;MPa, surpassing many supramolecular and polymer adhesives. The extreme temperature (&#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C) resistance capacity and underwater adhesion performance can significantly broaden their practical application scenarios. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments further demonstrated the persistent adhesion performance for surgical sealing and healing applications.

         <title>Four&#8208;Electron Oxidative Addition of an N=N Double Bond at a Chromium Metallocyclopropene
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report describes the synthesis of a chromium alkyne complex supported by a bidentate phosphinimide ligand. This compound features an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation, exposure of which to an azobenzene derivative leads to a rare 4&#8208;electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond across a single chromium center.







Abstract
This report describes the synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral chromium alkyne complex supported by a bidentate phosphinimide ligand and its reactivity with an azobenzene derivative. Characterization of the former by structural and computational methods reveals an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation by a formal chromium(II) center, suggesting that this complex is best described as a chromium(IV)&#8208;metallocyclopropene. Exposure of this compound to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;difluoroazobenzene results in the formation of a chromium(VI) diimido complex, which constitutes a rare 4&#8208;electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond. The isolation of a chromium(IV)&#8208;hydrazido intermediate enabled mechanistic investigations of this challenging bond cleavage process. This work substantiates the notion that terminal phosphinimide ligands can engender first&#8208;row transition metal ions with exceptional reactivity.

         <title>Reversible Amidation Chemistry Enables Closed&#8208;Loop Chemical Recycling of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites to Monomers and Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling of mechanically robust carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites to intact carbon fibers and pure monomers has been achieved by using reversible amidation chemistry. The polymer matrices can be completely depolymerized under acidic conditions at ambient temperature, allowing the separation and recovery of carbon fibers with fully restored mechanical properties as well as pure monomers with high yields.







Abstract
Highly efficient recycling of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites into monomers and fibers is a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a closed&#8208;loop recycling approach for carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites using reversible amidation chemistry, which enables the complete recovery of intact carbon fibers and pure monomers. The polymer network, synthesized by amidation between a macromonomer linear polyethyleneimine and a bifunctional maleic anhydride cross&#8208;linker, serves as a matrix for the construction of composites with exceptional mechanical properties, thermal stability and solvent resistance. The matrices can be fully depolymerized under the acidic condition at ambient temperature, allowing the effective separation and recovery of both carbon fibers and the two monomers. The reclaimed carbon fibers retain nearly identical mechanical properties to pristine ones, while pure monomers are recycled with high separation yields (&gt;93&#8201;%). They can be reused in for multiple cycles for the manufacture of new composites, whose mechanical properties recover over 95&#8201;% of their original properties. This line of research presents a promising approach for the design of high&#8208;performance and sustainable thermoset composites, offering significant environmental and economic benefits.

         <title>A Semiconducting Iron&#8208;Chelating Nano&#8208;immunomodulator for Specific and Sensitized Sono&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting iron&#8208;chelated nano&#8208;immunomodulator (SINM) that specifically triggers ferroptosis and M1 macrophage polarization and generates reactive oxygen species upon sono&#8208;irradiation was developed. SINM was applied to the specific and sensitized sono&#8208;metallo&#8208; immunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Sono&#8208;immunotherapy holds great potential for deep tumor inhibition; however, smart sono&#8208;therapeutic agents to simultaneously eliminate &#8216;domestic&#8217; tumor cells and regulate the &#8216;community&#8217; tumor immune microenvironment have rarely been developed. Herein, we report a spatiotemporally controllable semiconducting iron&#8208;chelated nano&#8208;metallomodulator (SINM) for hypersensitive sono&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. SINM consists of a semiconducting polymer (SP) backbone chelating iron ions (Fe3+) with thiophene&#8208;based Schiff base structure, and a hydrophilic side chain. Upon accumulation in tumors after systemic administration, SINM specifically arouses ferroptosis and M1 macrophage polarization due to its response toward the tumor redox environment; meanwhile, the chelation of Fe3+ enhances the sono&#8208;sensitizing effect of SPs, leading to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species for immunogenic cell death. Such combined sonodynamic metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of SINM efficiently ablates deep tumor and spatiotemporally regulates immunophenotypes.

A chromium(0) complex with a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) excited state sensitizes red&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion with 9,10&#8208;bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl) anthracene, performing upconversion with an efficiency of 1.8&#177;0.2&#8201;% and a pseudo anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.88&#8197;eV. Driven by the blue upconversion luminescence, polymerization of acrylamide is initiated with red light.

Photosensitizers for sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) often rely on precious heavy metals, whereas coordination complexes based on abundant first&#8208;row transition metals are less common. This is mainly because long&#8208;lived triplet excited states are more difficult to obtain for 3d metals, particularly when the d&#8208;subshell is only partially filled. Here, we report the first example of sTTA&#8208;UC based on a 3d6 metal photosensitizer yielding an upconversion performance competitive with precious metal&#8208;based analogues. Using a newly developed Cr0 photosensitizer featuring equally good photophysical properties as an OsII benchmark complex in combination with an acetylene&#8208;decorated anthracene annihilator, red&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion is achievable. The upconversion efficiency under optimized conditions is 1.8&#8201;%, and the excitation power density threshold to reach the strong annihilation limit is 5.9&#8197;W/cm2. These performance factors, along with high photostability, permit the initiation of acrylamide polymerization by red light, based on radiative energy transfer between delayed annihilator fluorescence and a blue light absorbing photo&#8208;initiator. Our study provides the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for photon upconversion with elusive first&#8208;row analogues of widely employed precious d6 metal photosensitizers, and for their application in photochemical reactions triggered by excitation wavelengths close to near&#8208;infrared.

&lt;p&gt;A chromium(0) complex with a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT) excited state sensitizes red-to-blue triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion with 9,10-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl) anthracene, performing upconversion with an efficiency of 1.8&#177;0.2&#8201;% and a pseudo anti-Stokes shift of 0.88&#8197;eV.

         <title>Interfacial Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Selenide Nanomembrane for Enantiospecific Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanomembranes were assembled from chiral selenium nanoparticles. The D&#8208;nanomembrane exhibited a photocurrent for L&#8208;kynurenine (L&#8208;Kyn) with a limit of detection of 0.0074&#8197;nM for L&#8208;Kyn, which could be applied to distinguish L&#8208;Kyn in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from Alzheimer's disease patients.







Abstract
Here, we report the synthesis of chiral selenium nanoparticles (NPs) using cysteine and the interfacial assembly strategy to generate a self&#8208;assembled nanomembrane on a large&#8208;scale with controllable morphology and handedness. The selenide (Se) NPs exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the ultraviolet and visible region with a maximum intensity of 39.96&#8197;mdeg at 388&#8197;nm and optical anisotropy factors (g&#8208;factors) of up to 0.0013 while a self&#8208;assembled monolayer nanomembrane exhibited symmetrical CD approaching 72.8&#8197;mdeg at 391&#8197;nm and g&#8208;factors up to 0.0034. Analysis showed that a photocurrent of 20.97&#177;1.55&#8197;nA was generated by the D&#8208;nanomembrane when irradiated under light while the L&#8208;nanomembrane generated a photocurrent of 20.58&#177;1.36&#8197;nA. Owing to the asymmetric intensity of the photocurrent with respect to the handedness of the nanomembrane, an ultrasensitive recognition of enantioselective kynurenine (Kyn) was achieved by the ten&#8208;layer (10L) D&#8208;nanomembrane exhibiting a photocurrent for L&#8208;kynurenine (L&#8208;Kyn) that was 8.64&#8208;fold lower than that of D&#8208;Kyn, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0074&#8197;nM for the L&#8208;Kyn, which was attributed to stronger affinity between L&#8208;Kyn and D&#8208;Se NPs. Noticeably, the chiral Se nanomembrane precisely distinguished L&#8208;Kyn in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy subjects.

         <title>Phosphino&#8208;Phosphination Reactions: Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity of Phosphino&#8208;Phosphonium Cations with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cations of type [R3PPR&#8242;2]+ were shown to react with alkynes, affording phosphino&#8208;phosphination reactions. Such frustrated Lewis pair reactivity could also provide access to dissymmetric cis&#8208;olefin&#8208;linked bidentate phosphines while avoiding the conventional use of radicals, lithium reagents or transition metal catalysts.







Abstract
The phosphino&#8208;phosphonium cations of the form [R3PPR&#8242;2]+ are labile and provide access to the constituent Lewis acidic and Lewis basic fragments. This permits frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type addition reactions to alkynes, affording unprecedented phosphino&#8208;phosphination reactions and giving cations of the form [cis&#8208;R3PCHC(R&#8242;&#8242;)PR&#8242;2]+. This reactivity is further adapted to prepare several examples of a rare class of dissymmetric cis&#8208;olefin&#8208;linked bidentate phosphines.

         <title>Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described the first example of crystalline materials in which bulky iptycene derivatives (triptycene and pentiptycene) exhibit rotational dynamics in the solid state. It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave NHC ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable further design of systems in which large and complicated molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.







Abstract
Molecular motion in the solid state is typically precluded by the highly dense environment, and only molecules with a limited range of sizes show such dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the solid&#8208;state rotational motion of two giant molecules, i.e., triptycene and pentiptycene, by encapsulating a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complex in the crystalline media. To date, triptycene is the largest molecule (surface area: 245&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 219&#8197;&#197;3) for which rotation has been reported in the solid state, with the largest rotational diameter among reported solid&#8208;state molecular rotors (9.5&#8197;&#197;). However, the pentiptycene rotator that is the subject of this study (surface area: 392&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 361&#8197;&#197;3; rotational diameter: 13.0&#8197;&#197;) surpasses this record. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of both the developed rotors revealed that these possess sufficient free volume around the rotator. The molecular motion in the solid state was confirmed using variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state 2H spin&#8208;echo NMR studies. The triptycene rotor exhibited three&#8208;fold rotation, while temperature&#8208;dependent changes of the rotational angle were observed for the pentiptycene rotor.

The site&#8208; and E&#8208;selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes over (pseudo)halogens (C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;F, C&#8722;OTf, C&#8722;OSO2F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives is reported. This unprecedented [Ge]&#8208;based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed and under air&#8208;tolerant and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Reported herein is a fully orthogonal olefination, which involves the site&#8208; and E&#8208;selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes, tolerating otherwise widely employed coupling handles such as aromatic (pseudo)halogens (C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;F, C&#8722;OTf, C&#8722;OSO2F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives as well as alternative functionalities. This unprecedented [Ge]&#8208;based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed (10&#8197;min to 2&#8197;hours) and operational simplicity owing to its base&#8208;free and air&#8208;tolerant features.

         <title>Rapid, Selective Extraction of Silver from Complex Water Matrices with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/Oligomer Composite Constructed via Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable ScCO2&#8208;assisted method was developed as a new strategy to construct metal&#8211;organic framework/oligomer composites. One such composite, denoted as MIL&#8208;127/PoPD, was subsequently used for the extraction of silver ions from several highly complex matrices.







Abstract
Every year vast quantities of silver are lost in various waste streams; this, combined with its limited, diminishing supply and rising demand, makes silver recovery of increasing importance. Thus, herein, we report a controllable, green process to produce a host of highly porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/oligomer composites using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) as a medium. One resulting composite, referred to as MIL&#8208;127/Poly&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine (PoPD), has an excellent Ag+ adsorption capacity, removal efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and provides rapid Ag+ extraction in as little as 5&#8197;min from complex liquid matrices. Notably, the composite can also reduce sliver concentrations below the levels (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Using theoretical simulations, we find that there are spatially ordered polymeric units inside the MOF that promote the complexation of Ag+ over other common competing ions. Moreover, the oligomer is able to reduce silver to its metallic state, also providing antibacterial properties.

         <title>Magnetoresistance in Organic Spin Valves Based on Acid&#8208;Exfoliated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid exfoliation strategy was employed to achieve covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films with excellent free&#8208;standing ability, which were then transferred onto La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSVs based on COF materials demonstrated a magnetoresistance signal of &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K, indicating the exceptional spin transport potential of this class of materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a burgeoning class of crystalline porous materials, have made significant progress in their application to optoelectronic devices such as field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, and photodetectors. However, the insoluble features of microcrystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF powders limit development of their thin film devices. Additionally, the exploration of spin transport properties in this category of &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton materials remains vacant thus far. Herein, an imine&#8208;linked 2D Py&#8208;Np COF nanocrystalline powder was synthesized by Schiff base condensation of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde. Then, we prepared a large&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing Py&#8208;Np COF film via a top&#8208;down strategy of chemically assisted acid exfoliation. Moreover, high&#8208;quality COF films acted as active layers were transferred onto ferromagnetic La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs) based on 2D COF materials. This COF&#8208;based OSV device with a configuration of LSMO/Py&#8208;Np COF/Co/Au demonstrated a remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the MR behavior of the COF&#8208;based OSVs exhibited a highly temperature dependence and operational stability. This work highlights the enormous application prospects of 2D COFs in organic spintronics and provides a promising approach for developing electronic and spintronic devices based on acid&#8208;exfoliated COF thin films.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Methylation Approach to Salt&#8208;Concentrated Hydrogel Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation modification of polymer skeletons releases hydrogen bond acceptors as Lewis base sites to assist salt dissolution, which enables a salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel electrolyte and addresses water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions in aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in developing flexible and safe batteries, but the presence of free solvent water makes battery chemistries constrained by H2 evolution and electrode dissolution. Although maximizing salt concentration is recognized as an effective strategy to reduce water activity, the protic polymer matrices in classical hydrogels are occupied with hydrogen&#8208;bonding and barely involved in the salt dissolution, which sets limitations on realizing stable salt&#8208;concentrated environments before polymer&#8208;salt phase separation occurs. Inspired by the role of protein methylation in regulating intracellular phase separation, here we transform the &#8220;inert&#8221; protic polymer skeletons into aprotic ones through methylation modification to weaken the hydrogen&#8208;bonding, which releases free hydrogen bond acceptors as Lewis base sites to participate in cation solvation and thus assist salt dissolution. An unconventionally salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel electrolyte reaching a salt fraction up to 44&#8197;mol&#8201;% while retaining a high Na+/H2O molar ratio of 1.0 is achieved without phase separation. Almost all water molecules are confined in the solvation shell of Na+ with depressed activity and mobility, which addresses water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions that limit the practical rechargeability of aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The assembled Na3V2(PO4)3//NaTi2(PO4)3 cell maintains 82.8&#8201;% capacity after 580 cycles, which is the longest cycle life reported to date.

         <title>Photodegradation of CuBi2O4 Films Evidenced by Fast Formation of Metallic Bi using Operando Surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray Scattering
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface sensitivity of Total Scattering/atomic Pair&#8208;Distribution Function (TS&#8208;PDF) and Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) enables to study the interplay between structural changes and photoelectrochemical performances of photocathodes. CuBi2O4 photocorrodes to metallic Bi and Cu. It further releases Cu ions in the electrolyte and forms BiPO4 structures at its surface. The rapid formation of Bi correlates with an abrupt drop of photocurrents.







Abstract
CuBi2O4 has recently emerged as a promising photocathode for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its fast degradation under operation currently poses a limit to its application. Here, we report a novel method to study operando the semiconductor&#8208;electrolyte interface during PEC operation by surface&#8208;sensitive high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering. We find that a fast decrease in the generated photocurrents correlates directly with the formation of a metallic Bi phase. We further show that the slower formation of metallic Cu, as well as the dissolution of the electrode in contact with the electrolyte, further affect the CuBi2O4 activity and morphology. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the degradation mechanisms affecting CuBi2O4 electrodes under operation and poses the methodological basis to investigate the photocorrosion processes affecting a wide range of PEC materials.

         <title>Site Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Regulating Peroxymonosulfate Activation to Generate Singlet Oxygen with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By altering the initial adsorption configuration of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and its subsequent bond&#8208;breaking modes, covalent organic frameworks with bipyridine units (BPY&#8208;COFs) switch PMS activation from a radical pathway to the nonradical one with 100&#8201;% singlet oxygen selectivity, achieving impressive degradation performance and high compatibility with water matrices.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for the selective conversion of organic matter, especially in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, due to the huge dilemma in synthesizing single&#8208;site type catalysts, the control and regulation of 1O2 generation in AOPs is still challenging and the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. Here, taking advantage of the well&#8208;defined and flexibly tunable sites of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we report the first achievement in precisely regulating ROSs generation in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs by site engineering of COFs. Remarkably, COFs with bipyridine units (BPY&#8208;COFs) facilitate PMS activation via a nonradical pathway with 100&#8201;% 1O2, whereas biphenyl&#8208;based COFs (BPD&#8208;COFs) with almost identical structures activate PMS to produce radicals (&#8901;OH and SO4&#8901;&#8722;). The BPY&#8208;COFs/PMS system delivers boosted performance for selective degradation of target pollutants from water, which is ca. 9.4 times that of its BPD&#8208;COFs counterpart, surpassing most reported PMS&#8208;based AOPs systems. Mechanism analysis indicated that highly electronegative pyridine&#8208;N atoms on BPY&#8208;COFs provide extra sites to adsorb the terminal H atoms of PMS, resulting in simultaneous adsorption of O and H atoms of PMS on one pyridine ring, which facilitates the cleavage of its S&#8722;O bond to generate 1O2.

     alt="Site Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Regulating Peroxymonosulfate Activation to Generate Singlet Oxygen with 100&#8201;% Selectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By altering the initial adsorption configuration of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and its subsequent bond-breaking modes, covalent organic frameworks with bipyridine units (BPY-COFs) switch PMS activation from a radical pathway to the nonradical one with 100&#8201;% singlet oxygen selectivity, achieving impressive degradation performance and high compatibility with water matrices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an excellent reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for the selective conversion of organic matter, especially in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, due to the huge dilemma in synthesizing single-site type catalysts, the control and regulation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation in AOPs is still challenging and the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. Here, taking advantage of the well-defined and flexibly tunable sites of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we report the first achievement in precisely regulating ROSs generation in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based AOPs by site engineering of COFs. Remarkably, COFs with bipyridine units (BPY-COFs) facilitate PMS activation via a nonradical pathway with 100&#8201;% &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas biphenyl-based COFs (BPD-COFs) with almost identical structures activate PMS to produce radicals (&#8901;OH and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). The BPY-COFs/PMS system delivers boosted performance for selective degradation of target pollutants from water, which is ca. 9.4 times that of its BPD-COFs counterpart, surpassing most reported PMS-based AOPs systems. Mechanism analysis indicated that highly electronegative pyridine-N atoms on BPY-COFs provide extra sites to adsorb the terminal H atoms of PMS, resulting in simultaneous adsorption of O and H atoms of PMS on one pyridine ring, which facilitates the cleavage of its S&#8722;O bond to generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unique Octupolar 2D&#8208;Polymer Frameworks as Mixed Conductors and Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts for Dual&#8208;Promoted Li and S Electrochemistry: Multi&#8208;regulation Role of Ethoxylation Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of versatile cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked octupolar 2D&#8208;polymer framework (Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO) has been explored as both efficient mixed ionic/electronic conductors and metal&#8208;free sulfur evolution catalysts via ethoxylation chemistry, which enables a novelmultifunctional separator interlayer to simultaneously tune bidirectional sulfur redox kinetics and Li ion flux for advanced Li&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
Here, we for the first time introduce ethoxylation chemistry to develop a new octupolar cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked 2D polymer framework (Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO) capable of acting as efficient mixed electron/ion conductors and metal&#8208;free sulfur evolution catalysts for dual&#8208;promoted Li and S electrochemistry. Our strategy creates a unique interconnected network of strongly&#8208;coupled donor 3&#8208;(acceptor&#8208;core) octupoles in Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO, affording enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, substantial active sites and crowded open channels. This enables Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO as a new versatile separator modifier, which endows the modified separator with superior catalytic activity for sulfur conversion and rapid Li ion conduction with the high Li+ transference number up to 0.94. Thus, the incorporation of Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO can concurrently regulate sulfur redox reactions and Li&#8208;ion flux in Li&#8722;S cells, attaining boosted bidirectional redox kinetics, inhibited polysulfide shuttle and dendrite&#8208;free Li anodes. The Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO&#8208;involved Li&#8722;S cell is endowed with excellent overall electrochemical performance especially large areal capacity of 7.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at high sulfur loading of 8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies unveil the dominant multi&#8208;promoting effect of the triethoxylation on electron and ion conduction, polysulfide adsorption and catalytic conversion as well as previously&#8208;unexplored &#8722;CN/C&#8722;O dual&#8208;site synergistic effect for enhanced polysulfide adsorption and reduced energy barrier toward Li2S conversion.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Stereoconvergent C&#8211;H Borylation of Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enamides, functional derivatives of enamines, play a significant role as synthetic targets. However, the stereoselective synthesis of these molecules has posed a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry, particularly for acyclic enamides that are less thermodynamically stable. In this study, we present a general strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides by C&#8211;H borylation, which provides a versatile platform for generating the stereodefined enamides. Our approach involves the utilization of metalloid borenium cation, generated through the reaction of BBr3 and enamides in the presence of two different additives, avoiding any exogenous catalyst. Importantly, the stereoconvergent nature of this methodology allows for the use of starting materials with mixed E/Z configurations, thus highlighting the unique advantage of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations have shed light on the pivotal roles played by the two additives, the reactive boron species, and the phenomenon of stereoconvergence.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Transfer Hydrogenases Based on the Biotin&#8208;Streptavidin Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient Mn artificial transfer hydrogenases (ATHases) were developed using the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology, which exhibits high activity and enantioselectivity for the transfer hydrogenation of a wide range of aryl ketones. The S112Y&#8208;K121&#8197;M double mutation and the appropriate chemical structure of the Mn cofactor play critical roles in the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the enzymes.







Abstract
Artificial (transfer) hydrogenases have been developed for organic synthesis, but they rely on precious metals. Native hydrogenases use Earth&#8208;abundant metals, but these cannot be applied for organic synthesis due, in part, to their substrate specificity. Herein, we report the design and development of manganese transfer hydrogenases based on the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology. By incorporating bio&#8208;mimetic Mn(I) complexes into the binding cavity of streptavidin, and through chemo&#8208;genetic optimization, we have obtained artificial enzymes that hydrogenate ketones with nearly quantitative yield and up to 98&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). These enzymes exhibit broad substrate scope and high functional&#8208;group tolerance. According to QM/MM calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography, the S112Y mutation, combined with the appropriate chemical structure of the Mn cofactor plays a critical role in the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the artificial metalloenzyme (ArMs). Our work highlights the potential of ArMs incorporating base&#8208;meal cofactors for enantioselective organic synthesis.

         <title>Spleen SORT LNP Generated in situ CAR T Cells Extend Survival in a Mouse Model of Lymphoreplete B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spleen Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) transfected splenic T cells after intravenous administration without active targeting ligands to generate in situ Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells. In situ generated CAR T cells increased survival and reduced tumor liver metastasis by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model.







Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy is revolutionizing treatment for patients suffering from B&#8208;cell lymphoma (BL). However, the current method of CAR T cell production is complicated and expensive, requiring collection of patient blood to enrich the T cell population, ex vivo engineering/activation, and quality assessment before the patient can receive the treatment. Herein we leverage Spleen Selective ORgan Targeted (SORT) Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) to produce CAR T cells in situ and bypass the extensive and laborious process currently used. Optimized Spleen SORT LNPs containing 10&#8201;% 18&#8201;:&#8201;1 PA transfected CD3+, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells in wild&#8208;type mice. Spleen SORT LNPs delivered Cre recombinase mRNA and CAR encoding mRNA to T cells in reporter mice and in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model (respectively) after intravenous injection without the need for active targeting ligands. Moreover, in situ CAR T cells increased the overall survival of mice with a less aggressive form of B cell lymphoma. In addition, in situ transfected CAR T cells reduced tumor metastasis to the liver by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Overall, these results offer a promising alternative method for CAR T cell production with pre&#8208;clinical potential to treat hematological malignancies.

The first report on the multi&#8208;stimulus color&#8208;tunable afterglow polymeric system incorporating with dynamic responsive spiropyran molecular conversion. The amorphous copolymer exhibited obviously abundant and changeable multi&#8208;color afterglow emission from green to orange&#8208;red under different lights and pH based on energy transfer. Lastly, this smart material is successfully employed in programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting field.







Abstract
The stimulus&#8208;responsive room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have endowed wide potential applications. In this work, by introducing naphthalene and spiropyran (SP) into polyacrylamide as the energy donor and acceptor respectively, a new kind of brilliant dynamic color&#8208;tunable amorphous copolymers were prepared with good stability and processibility, and afterglow emissions from green to orange in response to the stimulus of photo or acid, thanks to multi&#8208;responsibility of SP and the energy transfer between naphthalene and SP. In addition to the deeply exploring of the inherent mechanism, these copolymers have been successfully applied in dynamically controllable applications in information protection and delivery.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Allylation of Ketones with Allenylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuH&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and regiodivergent allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes has been developed. Various tertiary homoallylic alcohols bearing an alkenyl silane or an allyl silane group were synthesized with high regioselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
We report herein a regiodivergent and enantioselective allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes through copper catalysis. With the combination of CuOAc, a Josiphos&#8208;type bidentate phosphine ligand and PhSiH3, allyl addition to a variety of ketones furnishes branched products in excellent enantioselectivities. The regioselectivity is completely reversed by employing the P&#8208;stereogenic ligand BenzP*, affording the linear products with excellent enantioselectivities and good Z&#8208;selectivities. The linear Z&#8208;product could be converted to E&#8208;product via a catalytic geometric isomerization of the Z&#8208;alkene group. The silyl group in the products could provide a handle for downstream elaboration.

         <title>A High Pressure Operando Spectroscopy Examination of Bimetal Interactions in &#8216;Metal Efficient&#8217; Palladium/In2O3/Al2O3 Catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has the potential to serve as a sustainable route to a wide variety of hydrocarbons, fuels and plastics in the quest for net zero. Synergistic Pd/In2O3 catalysts show high CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity, enhancing methanol yield. The identity of the optimal active site for this reaction is unclear, either as a Pd&#8208;In alloy, proximate metals, or distinct sites. In this work, we demonstrate that metal&#8208;efficient Pd/In2O3 species dispersed on Al2O3 can match the performance of pure Pd/In2O3 systems. Further, we follow the evolution of both Pd and In sites and surface species under operando reaction conditions using x&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy. In doing so, we can determine both the nature of the active sites and the influence on the catalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Desulfurative Transformations with Thioethers as Alkyl Radical Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl alkyl thioethers are an underutilized class of alkyl radical precursors that are demonstrated to outperform their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues under electroreductive conditions. Single electron transfer results in C&#8722;S bond cleavage and alkyl radicals that may react in C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond forming events or undergo radical&#8208;polar crossover, followed by protonation or carboxylation to furnish alkanes or arylacetic acids.







Abstract
Thioethers are highly prevalent functional groups in organic compounds of natural and synthetic origin but remain remarkably underexplored as starting materials in desulfurative transformations. As such, new synthetic methods are highly desirable to unlock the potential of the compound class. In this vein, electrochemistry is an ideal tool to enable new reactivity and selectivity under mild conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient use of aryl alkyl thioethers as alkyl radical precursors in electroreductive transformations, along with mechanistic details. The transformations proceed with complete selectivity for C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, orthogonal to that of established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron routes. We showcase a hydrodesulfurization protocol with broad functional group tolerance, the first example of desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation in Giese&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling and the first protocol for electrocarboxylation of synthetic relevance with thioethers as starting materials. Finally, the compound class is shown to outcompete their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues as alkyl radical precursors, demonstrating their synthetic potential for future desulfurative transformations in a one&#8208;electron manifold.

         <title>Diazulenorubicene as a Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of peri&#8208;Tetracene with Two Sets of 5/7/5 Membered Rings Showing Good Semiconducting Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A (3+2) annulation reaction has been used to synthesize diazulenorubicenes (DARs), non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings. These compounds show red&#8208;shifted absorptions, low LUMO energies, aromaticity switching, and high charge mobilities up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, on&#8208;surface synthesis with the DAR compounds leads to large non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have received a lot of attention because of their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of peri&#8208;tetracene, diazulenorubicene (DAR), with two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings synthesized by a (3+2) annulation reaction. Compared with the precursor containing only 5/7 membered rings, the newly formed five membered rings switch the aromaticity of the original heptagon/pentagon from antiaromatic/aromatic to non&#8208;aromatic/antiaromatic respectively, modify the intermolecular packing modes, and lower the LUMO levels. Notably, compound 2&#8201;b (DAR&#8208;TMS) shows p&#8208;type semiconducting properties with a hole mobility up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Moreover, further extension to larger non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs with 19&#8197;rings was achieved through on&#8208;surface chemistry from the DAR derivative with one alkynyl group.

The various oxidation states of the support and the coordination modes of metal in the Pd/PANI catalysts led to differences in metal dispersion and electron structure. The most electron&#8208;rich Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI nanocluster catalyst showed the highest TOF for reductive coupling to afford a bifuran ester as a bio&#8208;plasticizer with extremely low migration resistance.







Abstract
Developing well&#8208;defined structures and desired properties for porous organic polymer (POP) supported catalysts by controlling their composition, size, and morphology is of great significance. Herein, we report a preparation of polyaniline (PANI) supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable structure and morphology. The protocol involves the introduction of MnO2 with different crystal structures (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;) serving as both the reaction template and the oxidant. The different forms of MnO2 each convert aniline to a PANI that contains a unique regular distribution of benzene and quinone. This leads to the Pd/PANI catalysts with different charge transfer properties between Pd and PANI, as well as different dispersions of the metal NPs. In this case, the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst greatly improves the turnover frequency (TOF; to 88.3&#8197;h&#8722;1), in the reductive coupling of furfural derivatives to potential bio&#8208;based plasticizers. Systematic characterizations reveal the unique oxidation state of the support in the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst and coordination mode of Pd that drives the formation of highly dispersed Pd nanoclusters. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the more electron rich Pd/PANI catalyst has the lower energy barrier in the oxidative addition step, which favors the C&#8722;C coupling reaction.

An ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.







Abstract
Pursuing high power density lithium metal battery with high safety is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices, but uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequence formed unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) make the task really challenging. Herein, an ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes, showing superior room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 8.17&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transfer number of 0.82. The cryo&#8208;TEM was employed to visually monitor the in situ formed LiF and Li3N nanocrystals in SEI and the deposition of Li dendrites, which is greatly benefit to the theoretical simulation and kinetic analysis of the structural evolution during the battery charge and discharge process. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into the Carbon&#8208;Iodine Bond of Heteroaryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed aryne insertion into heteroaryl C&#8722;I bonds to access valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls, characterized by high efficiency and selectivity, has first been realized. The newly discovered Lewis acid catalyzed insertion model opens up numerous opportunities for the further development of aryne chemistry.







Abstract
Aryne insertions into the carbon&#8208;iodine bond of heteroaryl iodides has been achieved for the first time. This novel reaction provides an efficient pathway for the synthesis of valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls from heteroaryl iodides and o&#8208;silylaryl triflates in excellent regioselectivity. The copper(I) catalyst, which bears a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, is essential to accomplish the reaction. Control reactions and DFT calculations indicate that the coordination of copper, as a Lewis acid, with nitrogen atoms of heteroaryl iodides mediates the insertion of arynes into heteroaryl carbon&#8208;iodine bonds.

A series of &#946;&#8208;peptides containing cyclic thioether side chains adopted a 12&#8208;helical conformation, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR, and circular dichroism. Post&#8208;synthetic modifications, such as oxidation, desulfurization, and notably chemoselective conjugation, highlighted the unique potential of the methionine&#8208;like building block for diverse applications in peptidomimetic systems.







Abstract
We introduce a novel cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC), as a versatile building block for designing peptide foldamers with controlled secondary structures. We synthesized and characterized a series of &#946;&#8208;peptide hexamers containing ATTC using various techniques, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that ATTC&#8208;containing foldamers can adopt 12&#8208;helical conformations similar to their isosteres and offer the possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their properties via post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In particular, chemoselective conjugation strategies demonstrate that ATTC provides unique post&#8208;synthetic modification opportunities, which expand their potential applications across diverse research areas. Collectively, our study highlights the versatility and utility of ATTC as an alternative to previously reported cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks in both structural and functional aspects, paving the way for future research in the realm of peptide foldamers and beyond.

         <title>Synergic Electron and Defect Compensation Minimizes Voltage Loss in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic electron and defect compensation on Sn perovskites has been realized via alloying heterovalent metal halide salts. This concurrently optimized the interfacial carrier dynamics, compensated the prevailing vacancy defects and minimized the nonradiative recombination loss throughout the devices, thus affording best efficiency up to 14.02&#8201;% characterized by a record high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V and the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;V.







Abstract
Sn perovskite solar cells have been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the Sn perovskites are notorious to feature heavy p&#8208;doping characteristics and possess abundant vacancy defects, which result in under&#8208;optimized interfacial energy level alignment and severe nonradiative recombination. Here, we reported a synergic &#8220;electron and defect compensation&#8221; strategy to simultaneously modulate the electronic structures and defect profiles of Sn perovskites via incorporating a traced amount (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of heterovalent metal halide salts. Consequently, the doping level of modified Sn perovskites was altered from heavy p&#8208;type to weak p&#8208;type (i.e. up&#8208;shifting the Fermi level by &#8764;0.12&#8197;eV) that determinately reducing the barrier of interfacial charge extraction and effectively suppressing the charge recombination loss throughout the bulk perovskite film and at relevant interfaces. Pioneeringly, the resultant device modified with electron and defect compensation realized a champion efficiency of 14.02&#8201;%, which is &#8764;46&#8201;% higher than that of control device (9.56&#8201;%). Notably, a record&#8208;high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V was attained, corresponding to the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;eV reported to date, and narrowing the gap with Pb&#8208;based analogues (&#8764;0.30&#8197;V).

This concurrently optimized the interfacial carrier dynamics, compensated the prevailing vacancy defects and minimized the nonradiative recombination loss throughout the devices, thus affording best efficiency up to 14.02&#8201;% characterized by a record high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V and the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;V.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sn perovskite solar cells have been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the Pb-based counterparts due to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the Sn perovskites are notorious to feature heavy p-doping characteristics and possess abundant vacancy defects, which result in under-optimized interfacial energy level alignment and severe nonradiative recombination. Here, we reported a synergic &#8220;electron and defect compensation&#8221; strategy to simultaneously modulate the electronic structures and defect profiles of Sn perovskites via incorporating a traced amount (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of heterovalent metal halide salts. Consequently, the doping level of modified Sn perovskites was altered from heavy p-type to weak p-type (i.e. up-shifting the Fermi level by &#8764;0.12&#8197;eV) that determinately reducing the barrier of interfacial charge extraction and effectively suppressing the charge recombination loss throughout the bulk perovskite film and at relevant interfaces. Pioneeringly, the resultant device modified with electron and defect compensation realized a champion efficiency of 14.02&#8201;%, which is &#8764;46&#8201;% higher than that of control device (9.56&#8201;%). Notably, a record-high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V was attained, corresponding to the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;eV reported to date, and narrowing the gap with Pb-based analogues (&#8764;0.30&#8197;V).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Myocardial&#8208;Targeting Tannic Cerium Nanocatalyst Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8722;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidant properties have been synthesized. The nanocatalysts were used to treat myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, protecting cardiomyocytes from oxidative damage and preserving myocardial functionality.







Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Medications or surgery have been considered as effective protocols to treat IHD for decades. Yet the reperfusion of the blood flow frequently leads to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing prominent and irreversible damage to the cardiomyocytes. In the present work, tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8722;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidation capability have been synthesized and applied for the effective and biocompatible ischemia/reperfusion injury therapeutics. TA&#8722;Ce nanocatalysts could effectively rescue the cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress induced by H2O2 challenge as well as oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation in vitro. In the murine ischemia/reperfusion model, cardiac accumulation and intracellular ROS scavenging could be achieved against the pathology, substantially reducing the myocardial infarct area and recovering heart functionality. This work illuminates the design of nanocatalytic metal complexes and their therapeutic prospects in ischemic heart diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility, paving the way for the clinical translation from bench to bedside.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Foldamer&#8208;Based Artificial Lithium Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using pivaloyl chloride as a mild one&#8208;pot copolymerization agent, we successfully constructed a novel class of sulfur&#8208;containing aromatic amide helices. Having an average height of 2.1&#8197;nm, 3.6&#8197;&#197; in cavity diameter and helically arranged S&#8208; and O&#8208;atoms along the inner wall, these nanotubes display highly selective and efficient transmembrane lithium transport, with transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.







Abstract
Unlike many other biologically relevant ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl&#8722;, etc) and protons, whose cellular concentrations are closely regulated by highly selective channel proteins, Li+ ion is unusual in that its concentration is well tolerated over many orders of magnitude and that no lithium&#8208;specific channel proteins have so far been identified. While one naturally evolved primary pathway for Li+ ions to traverse across the cell membrane is through sodium channels by competing with Na+ ions, highly sought&#8208;after artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels remain a major challenge to develop. Here we show that sulfur&#8208;containing organic nanotubes derived from intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded helically folded aromatic foldamers of 3.6&#8197;&#197; in hollow cavity diameter could facilitate highly selective and efficient transmembrane transport of Li+ ions, with high transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to visualize molecular structures and interactions in a cellulose oligomer assembly. High&#8208;resolution imaging with CO&#8208;modified tips, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers and details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. Comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208; oligomers shows their spontaneous enantioseparation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8220;material of choice&#8221; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three&#8208;dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208;oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis
</title>

Use of mechanochemistry enabled the rapid in situ generation of Grignard reagents, thereby overcoming the longstanding limitations of the Magnesium&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction in solution.







Abstract
Organomagnesium halides (Grignard reagents) are essential carbanionic building blocks widely used in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with various electrophiles. In the Barbier variant of the Grignard synthesis, the generation of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive Grignard reagents occurs concurrently with their reaction with an electrophile. Although operationally simpler, the classic Barbier approach suffers from low yields due to multiple side reactions, thereby limiting the scope of its application. Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aromatic aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, and C&#8722;B bonds. The mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent&#8208;free, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and some weak Br&#248;nsted acids. Notably, solid ammonium chloride was found to improve yields in the reactions of ketones. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating the generation of transient organometallics facilitated by improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal.

         <title>Automated Generation of Microkinetics for Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reactions Considering Correlated Uncertainties

The Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is used to automatically generate an ensemble of mechanisms for the oxidation of emissions over Pt(111). By sampling energetic parameters from the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional, every generated mechanism corresponds to a different DFT functional. From the broad range of predictions, it is possible to identify microkinetic models that achieve remarkable agreement with experiments.







Abstract
The study presents an ab&#8208;initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first&#8208;principles&#8208;based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange&#8208;correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT&#8208;constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.

         <title>Artificial Urinary Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Acute Renal Allograft Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial biomarker probes (AMPro) are developed for noninvasive urinalysis of acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) in murine models. With advantages of high renal clearance and specific detection of graft&#8208;infiltrating immune cells, AMPros noninvasively detected the onset of ARAR as accurately as invasive flow cytometry analysis, and specifically distinguished ARAR from non&#8208;allograft diseases or non&#8208;alloimmune&#8208;specific inflammatory patterns.







Abstract
Acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) after kidney transplantation associated with reduced graft survival and eventual graft failure is poorly diagnosed in hospitals. Here, we report the development of Artificial bioMarker Probes (AMPros) for sensitive urinalysis of ARAR in murine models. AMPros spontaneously go to the kidneys after systemic administration, specifically react with the prodromal immune biomarkers to activate their near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals to report cell&#8208;mediated rejection, and efficiently undergo renal excretion into urine. Thus, AMPros enable convenient optical urinalysis that detects ARAR prior to histological manifestation of rejection, which is also earlier than current diagnostic methods measuring proinflammatory cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte mRNAs. Due to the high kidney specificity, AMPros&#8208;based urinalysis discriminates allograft rejection against other non&#8208;alloimmune specific diseases, which is unattainable by measurement of serological biomarkers. Such a noninvasive and sensitive urine test holds great promise in continuous monitoring of renal allograft conditions at low resource settings for timely clinical interventions.

         <title>Mo&#8722;Ni&#8208;based Heterojunction with Fine&#8208;customized d&#8208;Band Centers for Hydrogen Production Coupled with Benzylamine Electrooxidation in Low Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8722;Ni3N heterojunction was constructed for HER coupled with benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR), where charge transfer causes the upshift of d&#8208;band centers. One side facilitates H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER, the other side favors OH* production from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N to catalyze BAOR effectively. It shows 220&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V and FEs of &gt;99&#8201;% in low alkaline medium.







Abstract
Benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR) is a promising route to produce value&#8208;added, easy&#8208;separated benzonitrile, and effectively hoist H2 production. However, achieving excellent performance in low alkaline medium is a huge challenge. The performance is intimately correlated with effective coupling of HER and BAOR, which can be achieved by manipulating the d&#8208;electron structure of catalyst to regulate the active species from water. Herein, we constructed a biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8722;Ni3N heterojunction for enhanced bifunctional performance toward HER coupled with BAOR by customizing the d&#8208;band centers. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that charge transfer in the heterojunction causes the upshift of the d&#8208;band centers, which one side facilitates to decrease water activation energy and optimize H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER activity, the other side favors to more easily produce and adsorb OH* from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N and optimizing adsorption energy of benzylamine, thus catalyzing BAOR effectively. Accordingly, it shows an industrial current density of 220&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V and high Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;99&#8201;%) for H2 production and converting benzylamine to benzonitrile in 0.1&#8197;M KOH/0.5&#8197;M Na2SO4. This work guides the design of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for the scalable production of green hydrogen and value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Phase Separation of DNA&#8208;Encoded Artificial Cells Boosts Signal Amplification for Biosensing</title>

A DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell system, characterized by robust signal amplification through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and adaptable recognition patterns via molecular engineering is reported. The system is shown to function as a versatile, ultrasensitive biosensor.







Abstract
Life&#8208;like hierarchical architecture shows great potential for advancing intelligent biosensing, but modular expansion of its sensitivity and functionality remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, we discovered that a DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell with a liquid core (LAC) can enhance peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Hemin and its DNA G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer complex (DGAH) without substrate&#8208;selectivity, unlike its gelled core (GAC) counterpart. The LAC is easily engineered as an ultrasensitive biosensing system, benefiting from DNA&#8242;s high programmability and unique signal amplification capability mediated by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. As proof of concept, its versatility was successfully demonstrated by coupling with two molecular recognition elements to monitor tumor&#8208;related microRNA and profile cancer cell phenotypes. This scalable design philosophy offers new insights into the design of next generation of artificial cells&#8208;based biosensors.

A generalized caging strategy has been developed to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs.

Abstract
Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represent a promising therapeutic modality to address undruggable and resistant issues in drug discovery. However, potential on&#8208;target toxicity remains clinically challenging. We developed a generalized caging strategy to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs (sr&#8208;PROTACs) with diverse molecular blocks bearing robust and cleavable linkers, presenting &#8220;turn on&#8221; features in manipulating protein degradation. By leveraging pathological cues, such as elevated ROS, phosphatase, H2S, or hypoxia, and external triggers, such as ultraviolet light, X&#8208;Ray, or bioorthogonal reagents, we achieved site&#8208;specific activation and traceless release of original PROTACs through de&#8208;caging and subsequent self&#8208;immolative cleavage, realizing selective uptake and controlled protein degradation in vitro. An in vivo study revealed that two sr&#8208;PROTACs with phosphate&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing cages exhibited high solubility and long plasma exposure, which were specifically activated by tumor overexpressing phosphatase or low dosage of X&#8208;Ray irradiation in situ, leading to efficient protein degradation and potent tumor remission. With more reactive biomarkers to be screened from clinical practice, our caging library could provide a general tool to design activatable PROTACs, prodrugs, antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and smart biomaterials for personalized treatment, tissue engineering or regenerative medicine.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represent a promising therapeutic modality to address undruggable and resistant issues in drug discovery. However, potential on-target toxicity remains clinically challenging. We developed a generalized caging strategy to synthesize a series of stimuli-responsive PROTACs (sr-PROTACs) with diverse molecular blocks bearing robust and cleavable linkers, presenting &#8220;turn on&#8221; features in manipulating protein degradation. By leveraging pathological cues, such as elevated ROS, phosphatase, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, or hypoxia, and external triggers, such as ultraviolet light, X-Ray, or bioorthogonal reagents, we achieved site-specific activation and traceless release of original PROTACs through de-caging and subsequent self-immolative cleavage, realizing selective uptake and controlled protein degradation in vitro. An in vivo study revealed that two sr-PROTACs with phosphate- and fluorine-containing cages exhibited high solubility and long plasma exposure, which were specifically activated by tumor overexpressing phosphatase or low dosage of X-Ray irradiation in situ, leading to efficient protein degradation and potent tumor remission. With more reactive biomarkers to be screened from clinical practice, our caging library could provide a general tool to design activatable PROTACs, prodrugs, antibody-drug conjugates, and smart biomaterials for personalized treatment, tissue engineering or regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Borylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, Imines, Arenes and Heteroarenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Boranes and a Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we describe a stable semiconductor material, ultrathin CdS nanosheets, can act as a heterogeneous visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst to orchestrate oxidative and reductive interfacial electron transfers for borylation of assorted alkenes, alkynes, imines and aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane. The low&#8208;cost and easily prepared CdS catalyst can be recovered and reused for several runs with conserved activity.







Abstract
Although the development of radical chain and photocatalytic borylation reactions using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;borane as boron source is remarkable, the persistent problems, including the use of hazardous and high&#8208;energy radical initiators or the recyclability and photostability issues of soluble homogeneous photocatalysts, still leave great room for further development in a sustainable manner. Herein, we report a conceptually different approach toward highly functionalized organoborane synthesis by using recoverable ultrathin cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanosheets as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, and a general and mild borylation platform that enables regioselective borylation of a wide variety of alkenes (arylethenes, trifluoromethylalkenes, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and nitriles), alkynes, imines and electron&#8208;poor aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane as boryl radical precursor. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both photogenerated electrons and holes on the CdS fully perform their own roles, thereby resulting in enhancement of photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS.

         <title>Benzotriazole&#8208;Based 3D Four&#8208;Arm Small Molecules Enable 19.1&#8201;% Efficiency for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;Based Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>

We synthesized three 3D four&#8208;arm small molecules with spirobifluorene as the central core and different end&#8208;group&#8208;modified benzotriazole units as arms. By incorporating four&#8208;arm molecules, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved improved efficiencies of 18.7&#8211;19.1&#8201;%, benefiting from triggered multiple mechanisms and the inhibited excessive aggregation of Y6. Our results open a new avenue for the design of promising guest molecules for ternary OSCs.







Abstract
A third component featuring a planar backbone structure similar to the binary host molecule has been the preferred ingredient for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we explored a new avenue that introduces 3D&#8208;structured molecules as guest acceptors. Spirobifluorene (SF) is chosen as the core to combine with three different terminal&#8208;modified (rhodanine, thiazolidinedione, and dicyano&#8208;substituted rhodanine) benzotriazole (BTA) units, affording three four&#8208;arm molecules, SF&#8208;BTA1, SF&#8208;BTA2, and SF&#8208;BTA3, respectively. After adding these three materials to the classical system PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, the resulting ternary devices obtained ultra&#8208;high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.1&#8201;%, 18.7&#8201;%, and 18.8&#8201;%, respectively, compared with the binary OSCs (PCE=17.4&#8201;%). SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 can work as energy donors to increase charge generation via energy transfer. In addition, the charge transfer between PM6 and SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 also acts to enhance charge generation. Introducing SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 could form acceptor alloys to modify the molecular energy level and inhibit the self&#8208;aggregation of Y6, thereby reducing energy loss and balancing charge transport. Our success in 3D multi&#8208;arm materials as the third component shows good universality and brings a new perspective. The further functional development of multi&#8208;arm materials could make OSCs more stable and efficient.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrolysis of Biaryl Oxazepines for the Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryl Amino Phenol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed (dynamic) kinetic ring&#8208;opening of biaryl oxazepines with water has been disclosed. A wide range of biaryl oxazepine substrates underwent this catalytic asymmetric hydrolysis reaction in a highly enantioselective manner. Key parameters for the success of this reaction are the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions.







Abstract
The development of catalytic asymmetric reaction with water as the reactant is challenging due to the reactivity&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#8208;control issues resulted from the low nucleophilicity and the small size of water. We disclose herein a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of biaryl oxazepines with water. A series of biaryl oxazepines undergo the CPA catalyzed asymmetric hydrolysis in a highly enantioselective manner. The key for the success of this reaction is the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution pathway and the CPA catalyzed addition of water to the imine group is both enantio&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Ultrasmall Recyclable Iridium(0) Nanoparticles for Regioselective Aromatic Hydrogenation of Phosphine Oxide Scaffolds: An Easy Access to New Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly regioselective hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes through ligand&#8208;free iridium(0) nanoparticle catalysis is described. This novel pathway allows the formation of both new and well&#8208;established H8&#8208;BINAP ligand&#8208;types.







Abstract
Herein, we developed the recyclable ligand&#8208;free iridium (Ir)&#8208;hydride based Ir0 nanoparticles (NPs) for the first regioselective partial hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. Both the isolated and in situ generated NPs are catalytically active. A control nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study revealed the presence of metal&#8208;surface&#8208;bound hydrides, most likely formed from Ir0 species. A control NMR study confirmed that hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent was accountable for substrate activation via hydrogen bonding. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy of the catalyst supports the formation of ultrasmall NPs, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the dominance of Ir0 in the NPs. The catalytic activity of NPs is broad as showcased by highly regioselective aromatic ring reduction in various phosphine oxides or phosphonates. The study also showcased a novel pathway toward preparing bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (H8&#8208;BINAP) and its derivatives without losing enantioselectivity during catalytic events.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Stereoselective Glycosylation via RhII and Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Cocatalyzed Carbenoid Insertion to the Anomeric OH Bond for the Synthesis of Glycoconjugates</title>

An efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates was reported via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion, achieving excellent anomeric/diastereo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of glycoconjugates is essential for studying the biological functions of carbohydrates. We herein report an efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of challenging &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion to the anomeric OH bond. Notably, we observed excellent anomeric selectivity, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency for this glycosylation reaction by exploring various parameters of the cocatalytic system. DFT calculations suggested that the anomeric selectivity was mainly determined by steric interactions between the C2&#8208;carbon of the carbohydrate and the phenyl group of the metal carbenoid, while &#960;/&#960; interactions with the C2&#8722;OBn substituent on the carbohydrate substrate play a significant role for diastereoselectivity at the newly generated stereogenic center.

         <title>A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru Composition Space
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using combinations of machine&#8208;learning inferred input features and different prediction models, the measured catalytic activity of 1582 complex solid solution alloys within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru composition space was predicted. The results show multiple approaches converging on the same understanding of the underlying catalytic theory and demonstrate a viable strategy using high&#8208;entropy materials for catalyst discovery.







Abstract
Compositionally complex materials such as high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor&#8208;activity relationship, as experimentally screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross&#8208;validated mean absolute error of 0.042&#8197;mA/cm2 by applying a theory&#8208;derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high&#8208;entropy materials.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;derived Fluorinated Secondary Interphase for Reversible Zn&#8208;graphite Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer that facilitates reversible anion intercalation and de&#8208;intercalation processes in dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIB) by preventing graphite exfoliation and suppressing solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation is demonstrated. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB with high Coulombic efficiency and an attractive discharge capacity.







Abstract
The irreversibility of anion intercalation&#8208;deintercalation is a fundamental issue in determining the cycling stability of a dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB). In this work, we demonstrate that using a partially fluorinated carbonate solvent can drive a beneficial fluorinated secondary interphase layer formation. Such layer facilitates reversible anion (de&#8722;)intercalation processes by impeding solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation and the associated graphite exfoliation. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB&#8212;a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5&#8201;% after 800&#8197;cycles, with an attractive discharge capacity of 156&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a mid&#8208;point discharge voltage of &#8776;1.7&#8197;V (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). In addition, the formed fluorinated secondary interphase suppresses the self&#8208;discharge behavior, preserving 29&#8197;times of the capacity retention rate compared to the battery with a commonly used carbonate solvent, after standing for 24&#8197;hours. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for addressing the critical challenges in graphite&#8208;based DIBs and contributes to fundamental understanding to help accelerate their practical application.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Sb2F10 in the Chemical Synthesis of F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the chemical synthesis of F2 has been elucidated by experimental and electronic structure theory methods. The elimination of F2 from MnF4 requires a large excess of SbF5 occurring in the last reaction step by addition of SbF5 to the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11]&#8722; anion producing F2 and crystalline Mn[Sb2F11]2.







Abstract
The purely chemical synthesis of fluorine is a spectacular reaction which for more than a century had been believed to be impossible. In 1986, it was finally experimentally achieved, but since then this important reaction has not been further studied and its detailed mechanism had been a mystery. The known thermal stability of MnF4 casts serious doubts on the originally proposed hypothesis that MnF4 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to a lower manganese fluoride and F2. This apparent discrepancy has now been resolved experimentally and by electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the reductive elimination of F2 requires a large excess of SbF5 and occurs in the last reaction step when in the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11] the addition of one more SbF5 molecule to the [SbF6]&#8722; anion generates a second tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anion. The two tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anions then provide six fluorine bridges to the Mn atom thereby facilitating the reductive elimination of the two fluorine ligands as F2.

         <title>Managing Excess Lead Iodide with Functionalized Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanosheets for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effectively managing excess lead iodide is crucial for enhancing perovskite stability. An innovative approach, tailoring functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets, stabilizes the perovskite structure and improves charge extraction. This leads to a significant boost in power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells, providing a novel perspective on stabilizing photovoltaic devices.







Abstract
Stability issues could prevent lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from commercialization despite it having a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long&#8208;term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets (Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7&#8201;% in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) PSCs. The devices retain 93.8&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.

         <title>A Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Microporous Polymer for a Wittig Reaction Cycle in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous reaction cycle for the Wittig reaction has been developed by synthesising a polymer with permanent porosity that incorporates the Wittig reagent. Therefore, the highly energy&#8208;intensive separation process needed in the homogeneous reaction pathway can be avoided. The material described could enable a continuous Wittig process in industry.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is a key step in industrial processes to synthesise large quantities of vitamin&#8197;A and various other important chemicals that are used in daily life. This article presents a pathway to achieve the Wittig reaction in a solid network. A highly porous triphenylphosphine&#8208;based polymer was applied as a solid Wittig reagent that undergoes, in a multi&#8208;step cycle, in total six post&#8208;synthetic modifications. This allowed for regeneration of the solid Wittig reagent and reuse for the same reaction cycle. Of particular industrial relevance is that the newly developed material also enables a simple way of separating the product by filtration. Therefore, additional costly and difficult separation and purification steps are no longer needed.

         <title>Breaking Local Charge Symmetry of Iron Single Atoms for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed iron atoms coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon nanocage substrates for NO3&#8722;RR was designed. The tuning of P increases the electron density of the Fe center, which promotes the adsorption and proton transfer of nitrate ions and related intermediates on the surface of electrocatalyst, leading to the superior NO3&#8722;RR performance at low overpotentials.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of nitrate pollutants into value&#8208;added ammonia is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the development of electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) has been hampered by high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency. Here we develop an iron single&#8208;atom catalyst coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C) as a NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalyst. Owing to the tuning effect of phosphorus atoms on breaking local charge symmetry of the single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom catalyst, it facilitates the adsorption of nitrate ions and enrichment of some key reaction intermediates during the NO3&#8722;RR process. The Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C catalyst exhibits 90.3&#8201;% ammonia Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 17980&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, operando SR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy measurements reveal the reaction pathway based on key intermediates observed under different applied potentials and reaction durations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the optimized free energy of NO3&#8722;RR intermediates is ascribed to the asymmetric atomic interface configuration, which achieves the optimal electron density distribution. This work demonstrates the critical role of atomic&#8208;level precision modulation by heteroatom doping for the NO3&#8722;RR, providing an effective strategy for improving the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts in different electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Regulating the Sequence Structure of Conjugated Block Copolymers Enables Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the sequence structure of conjugated block copolymers by two&#8208;pot polymerization, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is obtained which enables single&#8208;component organic solar cells to achieve 13.4&#8201;% efficiency with enhanced stability. In addition, for the first time, large&#8208;area rigid and flexible single&#8208;component organic solar cells are reported with an impressive efficiency of 11.62&#8201;% and 10.73&#8201;%, respectively, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.







Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) based on conjugated block copolymers (CBCs) by covalently bonding a polymer donor and polymer acceptor become more and more appealing due to the formation of a favorable and stable morphology. Unfortunately, a deep understanding of the effect of the assembly behavior caused by the sequence structure of CBCs on the device performance is still missing. Herein, from the aspect of manipulating the sequence length and distribution regularity of CBCs, we synthesized a series of new CBCs, namely D18(20)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT and D18(60)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by two&#8208;pot polymerization, and D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT(r) by traditional one&#8208;pot method. It is observed that precise manipulation of sequence length and distribution regularity of the polymer blocks fine&#8208;tunes the self&#8208;assembly of the CBCs, optimizes film morphology, improves optoelectronic properties, and reduces energy loss, leading to simultaneously improved efficiency and stability. Among these CBCs, the D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device achieves a high efficiency of 13.4&#8201;% with enhanced stability, which is an outstanding performance among SCOSCs. Importantly, the regular sequence distribution and suitable sequence length of the CBCs enable a facile film&#8208;forming process of the printed device. For the first time, the blade&#8208;coated large&#8208;area rigid/flexible SCOSCs are fabricated, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.62&#8201;%/10.73&#8201;%, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.

A novel distannylated electron&#8208;deficient monomer with high purity and reactivity was synthesized, which enables access to acceptor&#8208;acceptor type polymer acceptor PY5&#8208;BSeI with high molecular weight, planar backbone, narrow band gap, and low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO levels. The polymer shows a high electron mobility and very promising efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% in all&#8208;polymer solar cells.







Abstract
The shortage of narrow band gap polymer acceptors with high electron mobility is the major bottleneck for developing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, we synthesize a distannylated electron&#8208;deficient biselenophene imide monomer (BSeI&#8208;Tin) with high purity/reactivity, affording an excellent chance to access acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) type polymer acceptors. Copolymerizing BSeI&#8208;Tin with dibrominated monomer Y5&#8208;Br, the resulting A&#8211;A polymer PY5&#8208;BSeI shows a higher molecular weight, narrower band gap, deeper&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels and larger electron mobility than the donor&#8211;acceptor type counterpart PY5&#8208;BSe. Consequently, the PY5&#8208;BSeI&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current of 24.93&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 75.83&#8201;%. This efficiency is much higher than that (10.70&#8201;%) of the PY5&#8208;BSe&#8208;based devices. Our study demonstrates that BSeI is a promising building block for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors and stannylation of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks offers an excellent approach to developing A&#8211;A type polymers for all&#8208;PSCs and even beyond.

         <title>Modulating Electronic Structures of Iron Clusters through Orbital Rehybridization by Adjacent Single Copper Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

Combined density functional theory calculation and experimental analysis demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent Cu&#8722;N4 single atoms could regulate the d orbitals of Fe clusters through rehybridization to improve the release of *OH intermediates, thus achieving excellent oxygen reduction reaction kinetics.







Abstract
The atom&#8208;cluster interaction has recently been exploited as an effective way to increase the performance of metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the rational design of such catalysts and understanding their structure&#8208;property correlations remain a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent metal (M)&#8722;N4 single atoms (SAs) could significantly improve the ORR performance of a well&#8208;screened Fe atomic cluster (AC) catalyst by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis. The DFT studies suggest that the Cu&#8722;N4 SAs act as a modulator to assist the O2 adsorption and cleavage of O&#8722;O bond on the Fe AC active center, as well as optimize the release of OH* intermediates to accelerate the whole ORR kinetic. The depositing of Fe AC with Cu&#8722;N4 SAs on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet are then constructed through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resultant catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;eV in alkali and 0.80&#8197;eV in acid, as well as a high power density of 214.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in zinc air battery. This work provides a novel strategy for precisely tuning the atomically dispersed poly&#8208;metallic centers for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Bulk Passivation Enables Hundredfold&#8208;Enhanced Electroluminescence of Monophosphine Cu4I4 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster light&#8208;emitting diode based on a monodentate&#8208;ligand&#8208;based Cu4I4 cube realized a record luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) beyond 104&#8197;nits and 15&#8201;%, respectively, owing to a bulk passivation effect of the active host matrix through non&#8208;covalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu interactions. This markedly reduces nonradiative decay, leading to a doubled photoluminescence quantum yield of the film (99&#8201;%) and a 100&#8208;fold and sevenfold increased luminance and EQE of the devices, respectively.







Abstract
Electroluminescent (EL) clusters emerged rapidly, owing to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid character useful for comprehensive performance integration and the potential for large&#8208;scale display and lighting applications. However, despite their good photoluminescent (PL) properties, until present, no efficient EL monodentate ligand&#8208;based clusters were reported due to structural variation during processing and excitation and exciton confinement on cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Here we demonstrate an effective bulky passivation strategy for efficient cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes with a monophosphine Cu4I4 cube named [TMeOPP]4Cu4I4. With terminal pyridine groups, an active matrix named TmPyPB supports an effective host&#8208;cluster interplay for configuration fixation, structural stabilization, and exciton&#8208;confinement optimization. Compared to common inactive hosts, the passivation effects of TmPyPB markedly reduce trap&#8208;state densities by 24&#8211;40&#8201;% to suppress nonradiative decay, resulting in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PL and EL quantum yields reaching 99&#8201;% and 15.6&#8201;%, respectively, which are significantly improved by about 7&#8208;fold. TmPyPB simultaneously increases EL luminance to 104 nits, which is &#8776;100&#8208;fold that of the non&#8208;doped analogue.

         <title>Crossover Sorption of C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4 in Soft Porous Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible coordination networks exhibit crossover sorption with change in affinity and uptake capacity on varying the temperature. The coordination networks show reverse affinity and uptake capacity for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4. This phenomenon was verified by both sorption isotherm and isobar measurements at different temperature ranges. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations were used to elucidate the mechanisms.







Abstract
Porous sorbents are materials that are used for various applications, including storage and separation. Typically, the uptake of a single gas by a sorbent decreases with temperature, but the relative affinity for two similar gases does not change. However, in this study, we report a rare example of &#8220;crossover sorption,&#8221; in which the uptake capacity and apparent affinity for two similar gases reverse at different temperatures. We synthesized two soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs), [Zn2(L1)(L2)2]n (PCP&#8208;1) and [Zn2(L1)(L3)2]n (PCP&#8208;2) (L1= 1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene, L2=5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene, and L3=5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene). These PCPs exhibits structural changes upon gas sorption and show the crossover sorption for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4, in which the apparent affinity reverse with temperature. We used in situ gas&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis to reveal the guest inclusion structures of PCP&#8208;1 for C2H2, CO2, C2H6, and C2H4 gases at various temperatures. Interestingly, we observed three&#8208;step single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (sc&#8208;sc) transformations with the different loading phases under these gases, providing insight into guest binding positions, nature of host&#8211;guest or guest&#8208;guest interactions, and their phase transformations upon exposure to these gases. Combining with theoretical investigation, we have fully elucidated the crossover sorption in the flexible coordination networks, which involves a reversal of apparent affinity and uptake of similar gases at different temperatures. We discovered that this behaviour can be explained by the delicate balance between guest binding and host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Lattice Compression Revealed at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice compression at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale was first achieved in a newly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 nanocluster, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction compared to the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 nanocluster without lattice variation. DFT calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Lattice tuning at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified. Through ligand induction, we herein achieve the lattice compression in a &#8776;1&#8197;nm gold nanocluster for the first time, as detected by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In a freshly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 (CHT=S&#8208;c&#8722;C6H11) nanocluster, the lattice distance of the (110) facet is found to be compressed from 4.51 to 3.58&#8197;&#197; at the near end. However, the lattice distances of the (111) and (100) facets show no change in different positions. The lattice&#8208;compressed nanocluster exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) compared to that exhibited by the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 (TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzenethiolate) nanocluster and larger Au nanocrystals without lattice variation, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters. Further theoretical calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity.

         <title>An Encodable Scaffold for Sequence&#8208;Specific Recognition of Duplex RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recognition of nucleic acids by designed ligands has been a long&#8208;term objective due to the biological potential of these ligands. The significant goal of developing small molecule and protein motifs that target duplex DNA has been met but a recognition code for duplex RNA remains in infancy. We show that naturally occurring DNA&#8208;binding helix fork motifs, which do not target equivalent duplex RNA sequences, can be engineered to recognize RNA.







Abstract
RNA, unlike DNA, folds into a multitude of secondary and tertiary structures. This structural diversity has impeded the development of ligands that can sequence&#8208;specifically target this biomolecule. We sought to develop ligands for double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments, which are ubiquitous in RNA tertiary structure. The major groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA is sequence&#8208;specifically recognized by a range of dimeric helical transcription factors, including the basic leucine zippers (bZIP) and basic helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (bHLH) proteins; however, such simple structural motifs are not prevalent in RNA&#8208;binding proteins. We interrogated the high&#8208;resolution structures of DNA and RNA to identify requirements for a helix fork motif to occupy dsRNA major grooves akin to dsDNA. Our analysis suggested that the rigidity and angle of approach of dimeric helices in bZIP/bHLH motifs are not ideal for the binding of dsRNA major grooves. This investigation revealed that the replacement of the leucine zipper motifs in bHLH proteins with synthetic crosslinkers would allow recognition of dsRNA. We show that a model bHLH DNA&#8208;binding motif does not bind dsRNA but can be reengineered as an RNA ligand. Based on this hypothesis, we rationally designed a miniature synthetic crosslinked helix fork (CHF) as a generalizable proteomimetic scaffold for targeting dsRNA. We evaluated several CHF constructs against a set of RNA and DNA hairpins to probe the specificity of the designed construct. Our studies reveal a new class of proteomimetics as an encodable platform for sequence&#8208;specific recognition of dsRNA.

         <title>High Valence State Sites as Favorable Reductive Centers for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high valence Co3+ sites in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid catalyst can serve as the active site to drive a highly efficient and stable hydrogen evolution reaction at high current densities. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for producing sustainable and clean hydrogen. Typically, high valence state sites are favorable for oxidation evolution reaction (OER), while low valence states can facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, here we proposed a high valence state of Co3+ in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid as the favorable center for efficient and stable HER, while structural analogues with low chemical states showed much worse performance. As a result, the Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx catalyst could drive alkaline HER with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 22&#8197;mV for 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 175&#8197;mV for 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the industrial temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, with an excellent stability over 300&#8197;h. Moreover, this material could work for both OER and HER, with a low cell voltage being 1.730&#8197;V to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting at 60&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) clearly identified the high valence Co3+ sites, while in situ XAS during HER and theoretical calculations revealed the favorable electron capture at Co3+ and suitable H adsorption/desorption energy around Co3+, which could accelerate the HER. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.

         <title>Stabilizing Pt Single Atoms through Pt&#8722;Se Electron Bridges on Vacancy&#8208;enriched Nickel Selenide for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. Owing to the enriched vacancies of nickel selenide supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst with Pt&#8722;Se electron bridges, it exhibits an outstanding HER catalytic performance, which is ascribed to the accelerated electron transfer property, optimized water&#8208;dissociation ability and reduced reaction energy barrier.







Abstract
Rational design of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts provides a promising strategy to significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. The Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported by nickel selenide with rich vacancies was prepared via a hydrothermal&#8208;impregnation stepwise approach. Through experimental testation and DFT theoretical calculation, we confirm that Pt single atoms are well distributed at cationic vacancies of nickel selenide with loading amount of 3.2&#8197;wt.&#8201;%. Moreover, the atomic Pt combined with the high electronegative Se to form Pt&#8722;Se bond as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between single atoms and substrate for fast electron translation. This novel catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability over 120&#8197;h. Furthermore, the nickel selenide supported Pt SACs exhibits long&#8208;term stability for practical application, which maintains a high current density of 390&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 80&#8197;h with a retention of 99&#8201;%. This work points a promising direction for designing single atoms catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for advanced green energy conversion technologies.

This novel catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an excellent stability over 120&#8197;h. Furthermore, the nickel selenide supported Pt SACs exhibits long-term stability for practical application, which maintains a high current density of 390&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 80&#8197;h with a retention of 99&#8201;%. This work points a promising direction for designing single atoms catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for advanced green energy conversion technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Steric Hindrance of Porous Organic Polymers in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes to Induce the Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric hindrance of porous organic polymers tunes the relative position of TFSI&#8722; anions and catalytic sites, which affects the electron transfer ability, resulting in different LiF contents in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) of Li&#8208;ion batteries. The LiF&#8208;rich SEI formed under the steric hindrance influence of a single methyl group enhances the cycle performance of the battery.







Abstract
Lithium fluoride (LiF) at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) contributes to the stable operation of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Currently, most of the methods for constructing lithium fluoride SEI are based on the design of polar groups of fillers. However, the mechanism behind how steric hindrance of fillers impacts LiF formation remains unclear. This study synthesizes three kinds of porous polyacetal amides (PAN&#8208;X, X=NH2, NH&#8208;CH3, N&#8208;(CH3)2) with varying steric hindrances by regulating the number of methyl substitutions of nitrogen atoms on the reaction monomer, which are incorporated into polymer composite solid electrolytes, to investigate the regulation mechanism of steric hindrance on the content of lithium fluoride in SEI. The results show that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) will compete for the charge without steric effect, while excessive steric hindrance hinders the interaction between TFSI&#8722; and polar groups, reducing charge acquisition. Only when one hydrogen atom on the amino group is replaced by a methyl group, steric hindrance from the methyl group prevents TFSI&#8722; from capturing charge in that direction, thereby facilitating the transfer of charge from the polar group to a separate TFSI&#8722; and promoting maximum LiF formation. This work provides a novel perspective on constructing LiF&#8208;rich SEI.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkylation of Internal Olefin with Cycloalkanone to Directly Access Polycyclic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel SPD&#8208;NH2 organocatalyst that works cooperatively with a PdII complex to catalyze the asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation. It demonstrates great reactivity, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, bridged or fused bicyclic systems can be conveniently transformed into diverse di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetracyclic scaffolds for further conversion into biologically important compounds.







Abstract
An asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation of unactivated internal olefins with tethered cyclic ketones was realized by the cooperative catalysis of a newly designed chiral amine (SPD&#8208;NH2) and PdII complex, providing straightforward access to either bridged or fused bicyclic systems containing three stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Notably, the bicyclic products could be conveniently transformed into a diverse range of key structures frequently found in bioactive terpenes, such as &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene, cracroson D, and vulgarisins. The steric hindrance between the Ar group of the SPD&#8208;NH2 catalyst and the branched chain of the substrate, hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the N&#8722;H of the enamine motif and the C=O of the directing group MQ, and the counterion of the PdII complex were identified as key factors for excellent stereoinduction in this dual catalytic process by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Additive&#8208;Induced Interphases Enable Highly Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrahigh S&#8208;content additive, methylene methyl disulfonate, is preferentially oxidized via the strong interaction with PF6&#8722; anions. This forms the sulfur&#8208;rich interphase and broadens the oxidation stability of electrolyte, thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced electrochemical performance of high&#8208;voltage 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite pouch cells.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their promising high energy density. However, severe capacity degradation is witnessed, which originated from the incompatible and unstable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase at high voltage. Herein, a robust additive&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;rich interphase is constructed by introducing an additive with ultrahigh S&#8208;content (34.04&#8201;%, methylene methyl disulfonate, MMDS) in 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)||graphite pouch cell. The MMDS does not directly participate the inner Li+ sheath, but the strong interactions between MMDS and PF6&#8722; anions promote the preferential decomposition of MMDS and broaden the oxidation stability, facilitating the formation of an ultrathin but robust sulfur&#8208;rich interfacial layer. The electrolyte consumption, gas production, phase transformation and dissolution of transition metal ions were effectively inhibited. As expected, the 4.6&#8197;V NCM523||graphite pouch cell delivers a high capacity retention of 87.99&#8201;% even after 800&#8197;cycles. This work shares new insight into the sulfur&#8208;rich additive&#8208;induced electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase for stable high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>An In Situ Investigation of the Protein Corona Formation Kinetics of Single Nanomedicine Carriers by Self&#8208;Regulated Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy is designed to investigate protein corona formation kinetics of single nanomedicine carriers in situ. The nanoparticles with negative charges spontaneously enhance their local ECL intensity, and the enhancement degree is influenced by the formed protein corona. With the high spatiotemporal resolution of ECL microscopy, the protein corona formation process is monitored in situ and information of protein corona formation kinetics is obtained.







Abstract
Protein coronas are present extensively at the bio&#8208;nano interface due to the natural adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials in biological fluids. Aside from the robust property of nanoparticles, the dynamics of the protein corona shell largely define their chemical identity by altering interface properties. However, the soft coronas are normally complex and rapidly changing. To real&#8208;time monitor the entire formation, we report here a self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the interaction of the Ru(bpy)33+ with the nanoparticle surface. Thus, the heterogeneity of the protein corona is in situ observed in single nanoparticle &#8220;cores&#8221; before and after loading drugs in nanomedicine carriers. The label&#8208;free, optical stable and dynamic ECL microscopy minimize misinterpretations caused by the variation of nanoparticle size and polydispersity. Accordingly, the synergetic actions of proteins and nanoparticles properties are uncovered by chemically engineered protein corona. After comparing the protein corona formation kinetics in different complex systems and different nanomedicine carriers, the universality and accuracy of this technique were well demonstrated via the protein corona formation kinetics curves regulated by competitive adsorption of Ru(bpy)33+ and multiple proteins on surface of various carriers. The work is of great significance for studying bio&#8208;nano interface in drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment.

After comparing the protein corona formation kinetics in different complex systems and different nanomedicine carriers, the universality and accuracy of this technique were well demonstrated via the protein corona formation kinetics curves regulated by competitive adsorption of Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and multiple proteins on surface of various carriers. The work is of great significance for studying bio-nano interface in drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly and Chiral Induction of Metallo&#8208;Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different hierarchical superstructures were achieved with the addition of different halide ions (Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; or I&#8722;), which altered the intermolecular interactions between metallo&#8208;cage T and PF6&#8722;. In addition, chiral induction of the metallo&#8208;cage can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP&#8208; or MMMM&#8208;type enantiomers.







Abstract
The precise control over hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures relying on the elaboration of multiple noncovalent interactions between basic building blocks is both elusive and highly desirable. We herein report a terpyridine&#8208;based metallo&#8208;cage T with a tetrahedral motif and utilized it as an efficient building block for the controlled hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures in response to different halide ions. Initially, the hierarchical superstructure of metallo&#8208;cage T adopted a hexagonal close&#8208;packed structure. By adding Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; or I&#8722;, drastically different hierarchical superstructures with highly&#8208;tight hexagonal packing or graphite&#8208;like packing arrangements, respectively, have been achieved. These unusual halide&#8208;ion&#8208;triggered hierarchical structural changes resulted in quite distinct intermolecular channels, which provided new insights into the mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular aggregation and crystal growth based on macromolecular construction. In addition, the chiral induction of the metallo&#8208;cage T can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP&#8208; or MMMM&#8208;type enantiomers.

         <title>Rapid Ozone Decomposition over Water&#8208;activated Monolithic MoO3/Graphdiyne Nanowalls under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

The sp C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo hybridization in MoO3/GDY facilitates the activation of adsorbed water molecules to hydroxyl species, which act as the new active sites for rapid and efficient ozone decomposition under high humidity for potential practical application.







Abstract
Catalytic ozone (O3) decomposition at high relative humidity (RH) remains a great challenge due to the catalysts poison and deactivation under high humidity. Here, we firstly elaborate the role of water activation and the corresponding mechanism of the promoted O3 decomposition over the three&#8208;dimensional monolithic molybdenum oxide/graphdiyne (MoO3/GDY) catalyst. The O3 decomposition over MoO3/GDY reaches up to 100&#8201;% under high humid condition (75&#8201;% RH) at room temperature, which is 4.0 times as high as that of dry conditions, significantly surpasses other carbon&#8208;based MoO3 materials(&#8804;7.1&#8201;%). The sp&#8208;hybridized carbon in GDY donates electrons to MoO3 along the C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond, facilitating water activation to form hydroxyl species. As a result, hydroxyl species dissociated from water act as new active sites, promoting the adsorption of O3 and the generation of new intermediate species (hydroxyl &#8901;OH and superoxo &#8901;O2&#8722;), which significantly lowers the energy barriers of O3 decomposition (0.57&#8197;eV lower than dry conditions).

         <title>Modular Functionalization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Nitrogen Recovery from Fresh Urine
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular functionalized MOF&#8208;808 derivatives were deliberately designed and integrated in a newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process targeting fresh urine. Three distinct modification methods were applied for the development of functional MOFs which deliver efficient nitrogen conversion, recovery, detection, and all contributing to high fresh urine nitrogen recovery that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment.







Abstract
Nitrogen recovery from wastewater represents a sustainable route to recycle reactive nitrogen (Nr). It can reduce the demand of producing Nr from the energy&#8208;extensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process and lower the risk of causing eutrophication simultaneously. In this aspect, source&#8208;separated fresh urine is an ideal source for nitrogen recovery given its ubiquity and high nitrogen contents. However, current techniques for nitrogen recovery from fresh urine require high energy input and are of low efficiencies because the recovery target, urea, is a challenge to separate. In this work, we developed a novel fresh urine nitrogen recovery treatment process based on modular functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, we employed three distinct modification methods to MOF&#8208;808 and developed robust functional materials for urea hydrolysis, ammonium adsorption, and ammonia monitoring. By integrating these functional materials into our newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process, we achieved an average of 75&#8201;% total nitrogen reduction and 45&#8201;% nitrogen recovery with a 30&#8208;minute treatment of synthetic fresh urine. The nitrogen recovery process developed in this work can serve as a sustainable and efficient nutrient management that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment. This work also provides a new perspective of implementing versatile advanced materials for water and wastewater treatment.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Directed Site&#8208;Selective Csp3&#8208;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic amines can undergo Csp3&#8722;H borylation using BBr3. At high temperature in a microwave reactor, the &#945;&#8208;borylation is preferred, whereas the presence of a Lewis base at lower temperature will lead to the &#946;&#8208;borylation selectively. Mechanistic studies support the presence of an enamine intermediate for both processes.







Abstract
The borylation of Csp3&#8722;H bonds is a challenging transformation that is typically restricted to transition metal catalysis. Herein, we report the site&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free Csp3&#8722;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines. It is possible to selectively borylate piperidine derivatives at the &#945; or &#946; positions according to the reaction conditions. The mechanism was supported by NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations. It suggests that the piperidine is dehydrogenated by complexation with BBr3 to produce an enamine intermediate, which is in turn borylated at either the &#945; or &#946; position according to the reaction conditions.

         <title>Quadruple&#8208;Bidentate Nitrate&#8208;Ligated A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=K, Rb): Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Sufficient Birefringence</title>

The first nonlinear optically active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=K (KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), which feature unique quadruple bidentate&#8208;ligand [Hg(NO3)4] modules, exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation responses, together with sufficient birefringences and short ultraviolet cutoff edges.







Abstract
The design of efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals continues to pose significant challenges due to the difficulty of assembling polar NLO&#8208;active modules in an optimal additive fashion. We report herein the first NLO&#8208;active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=(KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), for which assembly is induced by ionic polarization of the d10 cations. The two new crystalline compounds are isostructural, featuring interesting pseudo&#8208;diamond&#8208;like structures with parallel [Hg(NO3)4] modules, and leading to strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses of 9.2 (KHNO) and 8.8 (RHNO) times that of KH2PO4. In combination with the simple solution preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale crystals, sufficient birefringence, and short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges, these attributes make KHNO and RHNO promising candidates for UV NLO materials. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis reveal that the newly&#8208;developed highly condensed and distorted [Hg(NO3)4] module, with an Hg2+ cation that is quadruply bidentate nitrate&#8208;ligated, is crucial for the significant SHG responses. This work highlights the potential importance of modules with multiple bidentate ligands for the development of high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation NLO materials.

         <title>Boosting Zn Anode Utilization by Trace Iodine Ions in Organic&#8208;Water Hybrid Electrolytes through Formation of Anion&#8208;rich Adsorbing Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of elevated de&#8208;solvation barrier caused by the addition of organic co&#8208;solvent to reduce H2O activity is solved via adding a trace amount of I&#8722; into the electrolyte. An I&#8722; ion&#8208;rich adsorbing layer is formed on the surface of Zn anode which promotes Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation and induces uniform Zn plating. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell achieves 10500&#8197;h lifetime and Zn//VS2@SS full cell cycles for 170&#8197;cycles with a high Zn utilization of 27&#8201;%.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H2O&#8208;induced Zn&#8208;corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H2O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50&#8197;mM iodine ions into an organic&#8208;water (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME)+water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H2O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond network and exclude H2O from Zn2+ solvation shell. And the I&#8722; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation barrier from 74.33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to 32.26&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5&#8197;months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5&#8201;%). In particular, the Zn//VS2@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170&#8197;cycles at a low N&#8201;:&#8201;P ratio (3.64). Even with the cathode mass&#8208;loading of 16.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the full cell maintains the areal capacity of 0.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 1600&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Polymer Chainmail: Steric Hindrance and Charge Compensation of Anion&#8208;Doped PEDOT to Boost Stress Deformation of Compressible Supercapacitor</title>

         <dc:description>
After the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films known as &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; were modified by PF&#8722;6 anion doping, the ion adsorption and diffusion processes on the PEDOT chains were significantly optimized due to the steric hindrance and charge compensation effects, so the cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% after 20,000 cycles) and rate performance (retaining 81.1&#8201;% at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3) were improved.







Abstract
Conducting polymers with high theoretical capacitance and deformability are among the optimal candidates for compressible supercapacitor electrode materials. However, achieving both mechanical and electrochemical stabilities in a single electrode remains a great challenge. To address this issue, the &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; is proposed with reversible deformation capability and enhances stability because of the steric hindrance and charge compensation effect of doped anions. As a proof of concept, four common anions are selected as dopants for Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and their effects on the adsorption and diffusion of H+ on PEDOT are verified using density functional theory calculations. Owing to the film formation effect, the 
 doped PEDOT/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon foam exhibits good mechanical properties. Furthermore, the composite demonstrates excellent rate performance and stability due to suitable anion doping. This finding provides new insights into the preparation of electrochemically stable conductive polymer&#8208;based compressible electrode materials.

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Regulate Silver&#8208;Copper Bimetallic Oxide Nanowires for Highly Selective Photoreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the surface of Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires are conducive to formation of a Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu adsorption configuration, which facilitates further protonation of a CO* intermediate. The active site promotes CO2 photoreduction to CH4 with improved selectivity to hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Highly selective photoreduction of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons is of great importance to achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Precisely manipulating the formation of the Metal1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal2 (M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2) intermediate on the photocatalyst interface is the most critical step for regulating selectivity, while still a significant challenge. Herein, inspired by the polar electronic structure feature of CO2 molecule, we propose a strategy whereby the Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites confined in a bimetallic catalyst surface are conducive to forming a M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate precisely, which can promote selectivity to hydrocarbon formation. Employing the Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires with abundant Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the preferred exposed {110} surface as a model catalyst, 100&#8201;% selectivity toward photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 has been achieved. Subsequent surface&#8208;quenching experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites do play a vital role in regulating the M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate formation that is considered to be prone to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons. This study reports a highly selective CO2 photocatalyst, which was designed on the basis of a newly proposed theory for precise regulation of reaction intermediates. Our findings will stimulate further research on dual&#8208;site catalyst design for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons.

Employing the Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires with abundant Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid-base dual sites on the preferred exposed {110} surface as a model catalyst, 100&#8201;% selectivity toward photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has been achieved. Subsequent surface-quenching experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid-base dual sites do play a vital role in regulating the M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate formation that is considered to be prone to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into hydrocarbons. This study reports a highly selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst, which was designed on the basis of a newly proposed theory for precise regulation of reaction intermediates. Our findings will stimulate further research on dual-site catalyst design for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Stabilized Ag1812+ Cluster with Excitation&#8208;Intensity&#8208;Dependent Dual Emission</title>

A DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag1812+ cluster displays dual emission which can be used to create a ratiometric light intensity meter.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA&#8208;AgNCs) are easily tunable emitters with intriguing photophysical properties. Here, a DNA&#8208;AgNC with dual emission in the red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions is presented. Mass spectrometry data showed that two DNA strands stabilize 18 silver atoms with a nanocluster charge of 12+. Besides determining the composition and charge of DNA2[Ag18]12+, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved methods were applied to characterize the picosecond red fluorescence and the relatively intense microsecond&#8208;lived NIR luminescence. During this process, the luminescence&#8208;to&#8208;fluorescence ratio was found to be excitation&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent. This peculiar feature is very rare for molecular emitters and allows the use of DNA2[Ag18]12+ as a nanoscale excitation intensity probe. For this purpose, calibration curves were constructed using three different approaches based either on steady&#8208;state or time&#8208;resolved emission measurements. The results showed that processes like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or photon upconversion through triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) could be excluded for DNA2[Ag18]12+. We, therefore, speculate that the ratiometric excitation intensity response could be the result of optically activated delayed fluorescence.

         <title>Fast Water Transport in UTSA&#8208;280 via a Knock&#8208;Off Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique water transport mechanism is investigated in the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UTSA&#8208;280. An incoming water molecule can replace a coordinated molecule, referred to as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. UTSA&#8208;280 has 1D channels but the knock&#8208;off transport enables water diffusion along the other two dimensions, mimicking a pseudo&#8208;3D mass transfer. As a result, the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane has a high diffusion selectivity of water over ethanol.







Abstract
Water and other small molecules frequently coordinate within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). These coordinated molecules may actively engage in mass transfer, moving together with the transport molecules, but this phenomenon has yet to be examined. In this study, we explore a unique water transfer mechanism in UTSA&#8208;280, where an incoming water molecule can displace a coordinated molecule for mass transfer. We refer to this process as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. Despite UTSA&#8208;280 possessing one&#8208;dimensional channels, the knock&#8208;off transport enables water movement along the other two axes, effectively simulating a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional mass transfer. Even with a relatively narrow pore width, the knock&#8208;off mechanism enables a high water flux in the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane. The knock&#8208;off mechanism also renders UTSA&#8208;280 superior water/ethanol diffusion selectivity for pervaporation. To validate this unique mechanism, we conducted 1H and 2H solid&#8208;state NMR on UTSA&#8208;280 after the adsorption of deuterated water. We also derived potential energy diagrams from the density functional theory to gain atomic&#8208;level insight into the knock&#8208;off and the direct&#8208;hopping mechanisms. The simulation findings reveal that the energy barrier of the knock&#8208;off mechanism is marginally lower than the direct&#8208;hopping pathway, implying its potential role in enhancing water diffusion in UTSA&#8208;280.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;loss Optical Waveguides through Balancing Deep&#8208;Blue TADF and Orange Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Hybrid Antimony Halide Microstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new group of hybrid antimony halide microstructures are fabricated through a rapid liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, which exhibit ultralow&#8208;loss 1D and 2D optical waveguides through balancing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and orange room temperature phosphorescence (RTP).







Abstract
Harnessing the potential of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is crucial for developing light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, sensors, and many others. However, effective strategies in this domain are still relatively scarce. This study presents a new approach to achieving highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF (with a PLQY of 25&#8201;%) and low&#8208;energy orange RTP (with a PLQY of 90&#8201;%) through the fabrication of lead&#8208;free hybrid halides. This new class of monomeric and dimeric 0D antimony halides can be facilely synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up solution process, requiring only a few seconds to minutes, which offer exceptional stability and nontoxicity. By leveraging the highly adaptable molecular arrangement and crystal packing modes, the hybrid antimony halides demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into regular 1D microrod and 2D microplate morphologies. This self&#8208;assembly is facilitated by multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the inorganic cores and organic shells. Notably, these microstructures exhibit outstanding polarized luminescence and function as low&#8208;dimensional optical waveguides with remarkably low optical&#8208;loss coefficients. Therefore, this work not only presents a pioneering demonstration of deep&#8208;blue TADF in hybrid antimony halides, but also introduces 1D and 2D micro/nanostructures that hold promising potential for applications in white LEDs and low&#8208;dimensional photonic systems.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Compatible Core&#8208;Shell Nanoreactor for in Situ H2&#8208;Driven NAD(P)H Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell nanoreactor was constructed for the manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis. The nanoreactor enabled not only the efficient H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration via the activated hydrogen species relay between metal nanoparticle and metal complex but also the compatibility of the metal catalysts and enzyme for chemoenzymatic cascade reduction.







Abstract
The regeneration of the reduced form cofactor NAD(P)H is essential for the extra&#8208;cellular application of bio&#8208;reduction, which necessitates not only the development of efficient artificial NAD(P)H regeneration catalytic system but also its well compatibility with the cascade enzymatic reduction system. In this work, we reported the preparation of a metal nanoparticle (NP) and metal complex integrated core&#8208;shell nanoreactor for H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration through the immobilization of a Rh complex on Ni/TiO2 surface via a bipyridine contained 3D porous organic polymer (POP). In comparison with the corresponding single component metal NPs and the immobilized Rh complex, the integrated catalyst presented simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity in NAD(P)H regeneration thanks to the rapid spillover of activated H species from metal NPs to Rh complex. In addition, the size&#8208;sieving effect of POP precluded the direct interaction of enzyme and Rh complex confined in the pores, enabling the success coupling of core&#8208;shell nanoreactor and aldehyde ketone reductase (AKR) for chemoenzymatic reduction of acetophenone to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol. This work provides a strategy for the rational manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis.

In comparison with the corresponding single component metal NPs and the immobilized Rh complex, the integrated catalyst presented simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity in NAD(P)H regeneration thanks to the rapid spillover of activated H species from metal NPs to Rh complex. In addition, the size-sieving effect of POP precluded the direct interaction of enzyme and Rh complex confined in the pores, enabling the success coupling of core-shell nanoreactor and aldehyde ketone reductase (AKR) for chemoenzymatic reduction of acetophenone to (R)-1-phenylethan-1-ol. This work provides a strategy for the rational manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Sub&#8208;1&#8201;nm Nanosheets of Co&#8208;assembled MnZnCuOx and Polyoxometalate Clusters as Anodes for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets anode co&#8208;assembled by MnZnCuOx (MZC) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was successfully constructed via introducing PMA clusters into MZC and precisely controlling the amount of PMA. The non&#8208;covalent interactions endowed the nanosheets with excellent structural stability, while the electron&#8208;rich properties of PMA greatly increased Li+ adsorption energy, thus exhibiting outstanding lithium storage performance.







Abstract
Transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) usually suffer from serious volume expansion leading to the pulverization of structures, further giving rise to lower specific capacity and worse cycling stability. Herein, by introducing polyoxometalate (POM) clusters into TMOs and precisely controlling the amount of POMs, the MnZnCuOx&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets (MZC&#8208;PMA HSNSs) anode is successfully fabricated, where the special electron rich structure of POMs is conducive to accelerating the migration of lithium ions on the anode to obtain higher specific capacity, and the non&#8208;covalent interactions between POMs and TMOs make the HSNSs possess excellent structural and chemical stability, thus exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance in LIBs, achieving a high reversible capacity (1157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an admirable long&#8208;term cycling stability at low and high current densities.

         <title>Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis at High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Correlates with its Composition&#8208;Dependent Potential of Zero Charge</title>

Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) experiments on a thin&#8208;film Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag high&#8208;entropy alloy materials&#8208;library (HEA&#8208;ML) reveal that the potential of zero charge (PZC) of different compositions of the Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag HEA has a linear correlation with its composition&#8208;weighted average of the work function, and positively correlates with its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities in acidic media.







Abstract
The vast possibilities in the elemental combinations of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) make it essential to discover activity descriptors for establishing rational electrocatalyst design principles. Despite the increasing attention on the potential of zero charge (PZC) of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, neither the PZC of HEAs nor the impact of the PZC on the HER activity at HEAs has been described. Here, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) to determine the PZC and the HER activities of various elemental compositions of a Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag thin&#8208;film HEA materials library (HEA&#8208;ML) with high statistical reliability. Interestingly, the PZC of Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag is linearly correlated with its composition&#8208;weighted average work function. The HER current density in acidic media positively correlates with the PZC, which can be explained by the preconcentration of H+ in the electrical double layer at potentials negative of the PZC.

         <title>Low&#8208;cost and Non&#8208;flammable Eutectic Electrolytes for Advanced Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost and non&#8208;flammable eutectic electrolytes are reported, which not only cost less than 1/200 of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes, but also show evident universality in various polyhydric alcohol solvents. Moreover, these eutectic electrolytes greatly expand the range of eutectic electrolytes available for advanced battery design.







Abstract
As a burgeoning electrolyte system, eutectic electrolytes based on ZnCl2/Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2 have been widely proposed in advanced Zn&#8208;I2 batteries; however, safety and cost concerns significantly limit their applications. Here, we report new&#8208;type ZnSO4&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes that are both safe and cost&#8208;effective. Their universality is evident in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols, in which multiple &#8722;OH groups not only involve in Zn2+ solvation but also interact with water, resulting in the high stability of electrolytes. Taking propylene glycol&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolyte as an example, it features significant advantages in non&#8208;flammability and low price that is &lt;1/200 cost of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes. Moreover, its effectiveness in confining the shuttle effects of I2 cathode and side reactions of Zn anodes is evidenced, resulting in Zn&#8208;I2 cells with high reversibility at 1&#8197;C and 91.4&#8201;% capacity remaining under 20&#8197;C. After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, super&#8208;high&#8208;capacity retention of 96.7&#8201;% is achieved after 500&#8197;cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.

         <title>Biomimetic Approach to Diverse Coral Diterpenes from a Biosynthetic Scaffold</title>

Synthetic biology enables the semisynthesis of numerous complex chemotypes starting from the soft coral metabolite klysimplexin R produced at gram scale. This approach has the potential to provide diverse molecules for drug discovery and development using a green approach inspired by nature.







Abstract
Thousands of coral terpenes originate from simple scaffolds that undergo oxidative tailoring. While corals are excellent sources of drug leads, the challenge of supplying structurally complex drug leads from marine organisms has sometimes slowed their development. Making this even more challenging, in comparison to other organisms, such as plants and microbes, for which the terpene literature is substantial, very little is known about how the unique coral terpenes are biosynthesized and elaborated in nature. In this study, we used a semisynthetic strategy to produce at gram scale in yeast the eunicellane scaffold that underlies &gt;200 coral compounds. Synthetic oxidation reactions were explored, generating key scaffolds that reflect three of the four structural classes derived from eunicellane and enabling the first asymmetric syntheses of the natural products solenopodin C and klysimplexin Q. Biomimetic methods and detailed mechanistic studies of synthetic reactions shed light on potential enzymological reactivity, including the role of epoxide rearrangement in eunicellane biosynthesis.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Highly Selective Separation of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel two&#8208;dimensional ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), denoted as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88, is synthesized utilizing the organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine. Once activated, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 demonstrates a notable selectivity for CO2 over C2H2 with an IAST selectivity index of 1894.







Abstract
The separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a very important but challenging task due to their similar molecular dimensions and physical properties. In terms of porous adsorbents for this separation, the CO2&#8208;selective porous materials are superior to the C2H2&#8208;selective ones because of the cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiency but have been rarely achieved. Herein we report our unexpected discovery of the first hydrogen bonded organic framework (HOF) constructed from a simple organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine (PYTPZ) (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88) as the highly CO2&#8208;selective porous material. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 is a two&#8208;dimensional HOFs with a pore pocket of about 7.6&#8197;&#197;. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 takes up a high amount of CO2 (59.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions with the record IAST selectivity of 1894. Its high performance for the CO2/C2H2 separation has been further confirmed through breakthrough experiments, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and molecular simulations.

Mechanochemistry makes the next move in advancing organometallic synthesis. In their Research Article (e202305775), Riina Aav, Dzmitry G. Kananovich et&#8197;al. report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes the limitations of the classic solvent&#8208;based approach. Mechanochemical activation enables the rapid generation of Grignard reagents in situ, making the process resistant to air and allowing solid Br&#248;nsted acids to be used as additives to improve yields.

Heterogeneous and recyclable ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles of iridium(0) enabled highly selective hydrogenation of distal unsubstituted aromatic rings to generate novel phosphine ligands. The iridium&#8208;hydride species and hydrogen bonding between the substrate and solvent facilitate the catalysis, as reported by Fabrice Gallou, Sachin Handa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307139).

         <title>Synthesis Strategies towards Tagged Homogeneous Catalysts To Improve Their Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review offers an overview and evaluation of the existing tagging strategies that are used to provide catalysts with improved recycling capabilities. It is focused on approaches that modify the solubility or the molecular weight to retain homogeneous catalysts in a liquid phase, which can be directly recycled. The insight provided should aid the development of more standardized catalyst recycling strategies and tags.







Abstract
The recycling of homogeneous catalysts while keeping them in the homogeneous matrix is an ongoing challenge many reactions face if they are to find industrial applications. While a plethora of different synthetic approaches towards better, recyclable homogeneous catalysts exist, the literature shows a gap when one searches for a concise overview of the different catalyst modifications. This Review is designed to close that gap by summarising the existing synthesis pathways towards polar, non&#8208;polar, fluorous, and molecular&#8208;weight&#8208;enlarged catalysts and by examining their respective synthesis routes with a focus on modular and late&#8208;stage approaches. Furthermore, we map out the potential for a generally applicable tag library that allows straightforward catalyst modifications to tune them for each desired recycling strategy.

         <title>Spontaneously Blinking Rhodamine Dyes for Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneously blinking fluorophores have the potential to significantly simplify experimental setups and extend the imaging duration of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy. This review offers an overview of the development of spontaneously blinking rhodamines from 2014 to 2023, as well as an in&#8208;depth analysis of the mechanistic aspects of spontaneous blinking.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has found extensive applications in various fields of biology and chemistry. As a vital component of SMLM, fluorophores play an essential role in obtaining super&#8208;resolution fluorescence images. Recent research on spontaneously blinking fluorophores has greatly simplified the experimental setups and extended the imaging duration of SMLM. To support this crucial development, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the development of spontaneously blinking rhodamines from 2014 to 2023, as well as the key mechanistic aspects of intramolecular spirocyclization reactions. We hope that by offering insightful design guidelines, this review will contribute to accelerating the advancement of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Drug Release for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release surmounts numerous limitations inherent in traditional light&#8208;controlled drug release and radiochemotherapy. However, further enhancements are required in areas such as drug carrier design, advancements in radiation chemistry, and X&#8208;ray dosage control. Therefore, this article aims to explore X&#8208;rays as a stimulus for controlled drug release in DDSs development, the mechanisms of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release, and its future prospects.







Abstract
Drug delivery systems (DDSs) are designed to deliver therapeutic agents to specific target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Recent developments in drug&#8208;loaded DDSs have demonstrated promising characteristics and paved new pathways for cancer treatment. Light, a prevalent external stimulus, is widely utilized to trigger drug release. However, conventional light sources primarily concentrate on the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light regions, which suffer from limited biological tissue penetration. This limitation hinders applications for deep&#8208;tissue tumor drug release. Given their deep tissue penetration and well&#8208;established application technology, X&#8208;rays have recently received attention for the pursuit of controlled drug release. With precise spatiotemporal and dosage controllability, X&#8208;rays stand as an ideal stimulus for achieving controlled drug release in deep&#8208;tissue cancer therapy. This article explores the recent advancements in using X&#8208;rays for stimulus&#8208;triggered drug release in DDSs and delves into their action mechanisms.

Highly twisted thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer character and form rigid molecular structures. This Review discusses and summarizes recent research progress in this domain, mainly covering the molecular design strategies and photophysical properties of twisted molecules, as well as the performance parameters of related OLED devices.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters have become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials, as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this Review, we have summarized recent progress in highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and give an overview of the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies, and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and the related OLEDs are also discussed.

         <title>Electrode/Electrolyte Synergy for Concerted Promotion of Electron and Proton Transfers toward Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy is devised to enhance the neutral water oxidation. The concerted promotion of electron transfer via the IrOx/NiOOH interface and proton transfer via the near&#8208;surface ion environment synergistically accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer events. The expedited kinetics enabled the direct detection of oxygen intermediates at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half&#8208;reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH&#8208;benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment that originated from hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end. These concerted promotions facilitated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events. Due to the electrode/electrolyte synergy, Ir&#8722;O and Ir&#8722;OO&#8722; intermediates could be directly detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the rate&#8208;limiting step of Ir&#8722;O oxidation was determined. This synergy strategy can extend the scope of optimizing electrocatalytic activities toward more electrode/electrolyte combinations.

         <dc:description>
A general approach to 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by reduction of spirocyclic oxetanyl nitriles was developed. The mechanism, scope, and scalability of this transformation were studied. The core was incorporated into the structure of the antihistamine drug Rupatidine instead of the pyridine ring, which led to a dramatic improvement in physicochemical properties.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Supramolecular Framework Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework birefringent crystal exhibits strikingly large birefringence of exp. 0.60@550&#8197;nm. This attribute would enable it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (o ray and e ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals could modulate the polarization of light and are widely used as polarizers, waveplates, optical isolators, etc. To date, commercial birefringent crystals have been exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds such as &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4 with birefringence of about 0.12. Herein, we report a new hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework, namely, Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O, which exhibits exceptionally large birefringence up to about 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, the birefringence of Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O is significantly larger than those of all commercial birefringent crystals and is the largest among hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework crystals. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that the exceptional birefringence is mainly ascribed to strong covalent interactions within (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; organic ligands and the perfect coplanarity between them. Given the rich structural diversity and tunability, hydrogen bonded supramolecular frameworks would offer unprecedented opportunities beyond the traditional purely inorganic oxides for birefringent crystals.

         <title>Centimeter&#8208;Size Single Crystals of Halide Perovskite Photoferroelectric Solid Solution with Ultrahigh Pyroelectricity Boosted Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

A homogeneous halide perovskite photoferroelectric PA2FAxMA1&#8722;xPb2Br7 solid solution demonstrates optoelectrical properties and a Curie temperature tunable over a wide range. When the component ratio is x=0.7, the bulk solid solution single crystal demonstrates an ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric coefficient, which facilitates self&#8208;powered and sensitive photodetection with boosted responsivity and detectivity over 1300&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoferroelectrics, especially emerging halide perovskite ferroelectrics, have motivated tremendous interests owing to their fascinating bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and cross&#8208;coupled functionalities. However, solid solutions of halide perovskite photoferroelectrics with controllable structure and enhanced performance are scarcely explored. Herein, through mixing cage cation, a homogeneous halide perovskite photoferroelectric PA2FAxMA1&#8722;xPb2Br7 solid solution (PA, FA and MA are CH3CH2CH2NH3+, NH2CHNH2+ and CH3NH3+, 0&#8804;x&#8804;1) has been developed, which demonstrates tunable Curie temperature in a wide range of 263&#8211;323&#8197;K and excellent optoelectrical features. As the component adjusted to x=0.7, the bulk crystal demonstrates ultrahigh pyroelectric coefficient up to 1.48&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1 around room temperature. Strikingly, benefiting from the light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity and remarkable BPVE, a self&#8208;powered and sensitive photodetector based solid solution crystals with boosted responsivity and detectivity over than 1300&#8201;% has been achieved. This pioneering work sheds light on the exploration of photoferroelectric solid solutions towards high&#8208;performance photoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides by Using Ball Milling and a Piezoelectric Material as the Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. A new protocol, starting from aryldiazonium salts, that uses ball milling and piezoelectric materials as redox catalysts is described. This process addresses the limitations of the Balz&#8211;Schiemann procedure, which is currently used in industry. In addition, the mechanism of this fluorination reaction is also investigated.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8211;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine and a terminal reductant.

         <title>Porphyrin Supramolecule as Surface Carrier Modulator Imparts Hole Transporter with Enhanced Mobility for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the charge&#8208;transport behavior of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) is a path toward improved hole mobility and enhanced device properties when used in solar cells. Here, we design a porphyrin supramolecule to modulate the surface properties of the commonly used Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTM in perovskite solar cells. Upon doping monoamine FeIII porphyrin into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, the porphyrins self&#8208;assemble into oxygen&#8208;bridged dimer&#8208;based supramolecules located at the grain boundaries of the HTM. The doped perovskite devices exhibit an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability.







Abstract
Modulating the surface charge transport behavior of hole transport materials (HTMs) would be as an potential approach to improve their hole mobility, while yet realized for fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices. Here, an oxygen bridged dimer&#8208;based monoamine FeIII porphyrin supramolecule is prepared and doped in HTM film. Theoretical analyses reveal that the polaron distributed on dimer can be coupled with the parallel arranged polarons on adjacent dimers. This polaron coupling at the interface of supramolecule and HTM can resonates with hole flux to increase hole transport efficiency. Mobility tests reveal that the hole mobility of doped HTM film is improved by 8&#8208;fold. Doped perovskite device exhibits an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the mobility of HTMs by surface carrier modulation, therefore fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by Unstabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles is described. Synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products were smoothly transformed into highly substituted pyridines. The method tolerates a range of electrophiles and proceeds under an atmospheric pressure of CO.







Abstract
This report describes the first example of palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles. The approach involves initiation by an unstabilized enolate nucleophile under an atmospheric pressure of CO and termination with a carbon electrophile. This process is compatible with a diverse range of electrophiles, including aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl iodides to yield synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products, which were demonstrated to be precursors for multi&#8208;substituted pyridines. A PdI&#8208;dimer complex with two bridging CO units was observed although its role in catalysis is not yet understood.

         <title>Self&#8208;quenched Fluorophore Dimers for DNA&#8208;PAINT and STED Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for fluorophore&#8208;labelled DNA oligonucleotides is introduced that relies on short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching of two identical fluorophores. This strategy achieves a reduction in background fluorescence, while at the same time increasing the photon budget two&#8208;fold. These probes can be applied to super&#8208;resolution techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM).







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution techniques like single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy have been extended by the use of non&#8208;covalent, weak affinity&#8208;based transient labelling systems. DNA&#8208;based hybrid systems are a prominent example among these transient labelling systems, offering excellent opportunities for multi&#8208;target fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques suffer from higher background relative to covalently bound fluorophores, originating from unbound fluorophore&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides. Here, we introduce short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching in fluorophore dimers as an efficient mechanism to reduce background fluorescence signal, while at the same time increasing the photon budget in the bound state by almost 2&#8208;fold. We characterise the optical and thermodynamic properties of fluorophore&#8208;dimer single&#8208;stranded DNA, and show super&#8208;resolution imaging applications with STED and SMLM with increased spatial resolution and reduced background.

&lt;p&gt;Super-resolution techniques like single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy have been extended by the use of non-covalent, weak affinity-based transient labelling systems. DNA-based hybrid systems are a prominent example among these transient labelling systems, offering excellent opportunities for multi-target fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques suffer from higher background relative to covalently bound fluorophores, originating from unbound fluorophore-labelled single-stranded oligonucleotides. Here, we introduce short-distance self-quenching in fluorophore dimers as an efficient mechanism to reduce background fluorescence signal, while at the same time increasing the photon budget in the bound state by almost 2-fold. We characterise the optical and thermodynamic properties of fluorophore-dimer single-stranded DNA, and show super-resolution imaging applications with STED and SMLM with increased spatial resolution and reduced background.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized DNA Circuit to Establish an Artificial Interaction between T Cells and Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit with recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules was designed to establish an artificial intercellular interaction mode between T cells and cancer cells. Based on cancer recognition&#8208;induced receptor aggregation, T cells could be directly stimulated to kill target cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Nongenetic strategies that enable control over the cell&#8208;cell interaction network would be highly desired, particularly in T cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. In this work, we developed an aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit to modulate the interaction between T cells and cancer cells. This DNA circuit was composed of recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules. Upon recognizing target cancer cells, the triggering strand was released to induce aggregation of immune receptors on the T cell surface, leading to an enhancement of T cell activity for effective cancer eradication. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this DNA circuit for promoting target cancer cell&#8208;directed stimulation of T cells, which, consequently, enhanced their killing effect on cancer cells. This DNA circuit, as a modular strategy to modulate intercellular interactions, could lead to a new paradigm for the development of nongenetic T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Amides by a Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Wolff Rearrangement
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral amides was achieved by an asymmetric Wolff rearrangement. A bifunctional phosphoric acid catalyst not only expedited the transformation but also controlled the enantioselectivity. The developed method enables the asymmetric addition between potent nucleophilic reagents and ketene species and provides a new approach to chiral amides.







Abstract
The enantioselective addition of potent nucleophiles to ketenes poses challenges due to competing background reactions and poor stereocontrol. Herein, we present a method for enantioselective phosphoric acid catalyzed amination of ketenes generated from &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones. Upon exposure to visible light, the diazoketones undergo Wolff rearrangement to generate ketenes. The phosphoric acid not only accelerates ketene capture by amines to form a single configuration of aminoenol intermediates but also promotes an enantioselective proton&#8208;transfer reaction of the intermediates to yield the products. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway and explained how the catalyst expedited the transformation and controlled the enantioselectivity.

         <title>When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transmetallation of a transition metal metallocene &#8220;like&#8221; compound is reported for the first time. While the parent ferrocene analogue Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) is inert to this reactivity its imidazolium and NHC functionalized derivatives undergo rapid transmetallation to Ir and Cu.







Abstract
Ferrocene 1 and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue 2 are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetallation chemistry of the Fe&#8208;center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species 3&#8201;Fe and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that 3&#8201;Fe can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 that also displays unique reactivity. When 5 is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 it also undergoes a rapid transmetallation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford 6 but with the added twist that the Li&#8208;carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when 6 is subsequently treated with CuCl, the Li&#8208;carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li&#8208;carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster 8. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of Fluorophores from a &#8220;Flex&#8208;activated&#8221; Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first flex&#8208;activated fluorogenic mechanophore (FA) is presented. Its retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction, resulting in the release of anthracenes with turn&#8208;on fluorescence, is achieved through compression of FA&#8208;crosslinked networks or hydrostatic high pressure applied to FA crystals and its polymers. The structural and functional diversity of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores as sensitive and unconventional optical force probes is enriched.







Abstract
Optical force probes that can release force&#8208;dependent and visualized signals with minimal changes in the polymer main chains under mechanical load are highly sought after but currently limited. In this study, we introduce a flex&#8208;activated mechanophore (FA) based on the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct of anthracene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylatea that exhibits turn&#8208;on mechanofluorescence. We demonstrate that when FA is incorporated into polymer networks or in its crystalline state, it can release fluorescent anthracenes through a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction under compression or hydrostatic high pressure, respectively. The flex&#8208;activated mechanism of FA is successfully confirmed. Furthermore, we systematically modulate the force delivered to the mechanophore by varying the crosslinking density of the networks and the applied macroscopic pressures. This modulation leads to incremental increases in mechanophore activation, successive release of anthracenes, and quantitative enhancement of fluorescence intensity. The exceptional potential of FA as a sensitive force probe in different bulk states is highlighted, benefiting from its unique flex&#8208;activated mode with highly emissive fluorophore releasing. Overall, this report enriches our understanding of the structures and functions of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores and polymeric materials.

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanode prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition was first unraveled to mainly result from the phase impurity caused by the relatively easy vanadium volatilization. Consequently, a BiVO4 photoanode free of tetragonal phase and decorated with NiFeOx cocatalyst was fabricated to exhibit a benchmark photocurrent density.







Abstract
Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method.

It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method.

&lt;p&gt;The poor water oxidation performance of BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition was first unraveled to mainly result from the phase impurity caused by the relatively easy vanadium volatilization. Consequently, a BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode free of tetragonal phase and decorated with NiFeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; cocatalyst was fabricated to exhibit a benchmark photocurrent density.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two-step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), demonstrating the advantage of MOD method in scalable preparation.

         <title>Atroposelective PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis for the Isoquinoline&#8208;Forming Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The atroposelective formation of isoquinoline heterocycles by a PIII/PV=O redox organocatalyzed Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction is described. With N2 release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, the method permits the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomeric isoquinolines under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. and 93&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the feasibility of atroposelective PIII/PV=O redox organocatalysis by the Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction. The formation of isoquinoline heterocycles thereby enables the synthesis of a broad range of valuable atropisomers under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. Readily prepared azido cinnamate substrates convert in high yield with stereocontrol by a chiral phosphine catalyst, which is regenerated using a silane reductant under Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis. The reaction provides access to diversified aryl isoquinolines, as well as benzoisoquinoline and naphthyridine atropisomers. The products are expeditiously transformed into N&#8208;oxides, naphthol and triaryl phosphine variants of prevalent catalysts and ligands. With dinitrogen release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, it is anticipated that atroposelective redox organocatalysis provides access to a multitude of aromatic heterocycles with precise control over their configuration.

         <title>Capture of Singlet Oxygen Modulates Host&#8208;Guest Behavior of Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of anthracene&#8208;based tetrahedral capsules have been shown to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The cage cycloadducts were found to bind an array of guest molecules more weakly than their precursor cages, offering a novel method for stimuli&#8208;driven guest uptake and release.







Abstract
The anthracene panels of two tetrahedral MII4L6 cages, where MII=CoII or FeII, were found to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen (1O2) in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. ESI&#8208;MS analysis showed the cobalt(II) cages to undergo complete transformation of all anthracene panels into endoperoxides, whereas the iron(II) congeners underwent incomplete conversion. The reaction was found to be partially reversible in the case of the 1&#8208;FeII cage. The dioxygen&#8208;cage cycloadducts were found to bind a set of guest molecules more weakly than the parent cages, with affinity dropping by more than two orders of magnitude in some cases. The light&#8208;driven cycloaddition reaction between cage and 1O2 thus served as a stimulus for guest release and reuptake.

         <title>Engineering nucleotidoproteins for base pairing&#8208;assisted cytosolic delivery and genome editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein therapeutics targeting intracellular machineries holds profound potentials for disease treatment, and hence robust cytosolic protein delivery technologies are imperatively demanded. Inspired by the super&#8208;negatively charged, nucleotide&#8208;enriched structure of nucleic acids, adenylated pro&#8208;proteins (A&#8208;proteins) with dramatically enhanced negative surface charges are first engineered via facile green synthesis. Then, thymidine&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine is developed, which renders strong electrostatic attraction, complementary base pairing, and hydrophobic interaction with A&#8208;proteins to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiencies. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the A&#8208;proteins and consequently promotes the intracellular release of the native proteins. This strategy shows high efficiency and universality for varieties of proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points in mammalian cells. Moreover, it enables highly efficient delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting fusion oncogene EWSR1&#8208;FLI1, leading to pronounced anti&#8208;tumor efficacy against Ewing sarcoma. This study provides a potent and versatile platform for cytosolic protein delivery and gene editing, and may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ambiguous Origin of Thermochromism in Molecular Crystals of Dichalcogenides: Chalcogen Bonds versus Dynamic Se&#9472;Se/Te&#9472;Te Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report thermochromism in crystals of diphenyl diselenide (dpdSe) and diphenyl ditelluride (dpdTe), which is at variance with the commonly known mechanisms of thermochromism in molecular crystals. Variable temperature neutron diffraction studies indicated no conformational change, tautomerization or phase transition between 100 K and 295 K. High&#8208;pressure crystallography studies indicated no associated piezochromism in dpdSe and dpdTe crystals. The evolution of the crystal structures and their electronic band structure with pressure and temperature reveal the contributions of intramolecular and intermolecular factors towards the origin of thermochromism &#8211; especially the intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds and torsional modes of vibrations around the dynamic Se&#9472;Se and Te&#9472;Te bonds. Further, a co&#8208;crystal of dpdSe with iodine (dpdSe&#8208;I2) and an alloy crystal of dpdSe and dpdTe implied a predominantly intramolecular origin of the observed thermochromism associated with vibronic coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic Coordination Manganese Complex as Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;Mn battery has been considered as the most promising scalable energy&#8208;storage system due to its intrinsic safety and especially ultralow cost. However, the traditional Zn&#8208;Mn battery mainly using manganese oxides as cathode shows low voltage and suffers from dissolution/disproportionation of the cathode during cycling. Herein, for the first time, a high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8208;Mn battery based on a highly reversible organic coordination manganese complex cathode (Manganese polyacrylate, PAL&#8208;Mn) was constructed. Benefiting from the insoluble carboxylate ligand of PAL&#8208;Mn that can suppress shuttle effect and disproportionationation reaction of Mn3+ in a mild electrolyte, Mn3+/Mn2+ reaction in coordination state is realized, which not only offers a high discharge voltage of 1.67 V but also exhibits excellent cyclability(100% capacity retention, after 4000 cycles). High voltage reaction endows the Zn&#8208;Mn battery high specific energy (600 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), indicating a bright application prospect. The strategy of introducing carboxylate ligands in Zn&#8208;Mn battery to harness high&#8208;voltage reaction of Mn3+/Mn2+ well broadens the research of high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8208;Mn batteries under mild electrolyte conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu2+&#8208;Anchored Carbon Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts for Visible Water Splitting to Boost Hydrogen Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both hydrogen (H2) and copper ions (Cu+) can be used as anti&#8208;cancer treatments. However, the continuous generation of H2 molecules and Cu+ in specific sites of tumors is challenging. Here we anchored Cu2+ on carbon photocatalysts (Cu@CDCN) to allow the continuous generation of H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors using the two&#8208;electron process of visible water splitting. The photocatalytic process also generated redox&#8208;active Cu&#8208;carbon centers. Meanwhile, the Cu2+ residues reacted with H2O2 (the obstacle to the photocatalytic process) to accelerate the two&#8208;electron process of water splitting and cuprous ion (Cu+) generation, in which the Cu2+ residue promoted a pro&#8208;oxidant effect with glutathione through metal&#8208;reducing actions. Both H2 and Cu+ induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction, which enabled hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis to inhibit cancer cell growth and suppress tumor growth. Our research is the first attempt to integrate hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis using metal&#8208;enhanced visible solar water splitting in nanomedicine, which may provide a safe and effective cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Schiff Base Reaction in a Living Cell: In Situ Synthesis of a Hollow Covalent Organic Polymer To Regulate Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificially performing chemical reactions in living biosystems to attain various physiological aims remains an intriguing but very challenging task. In this work, the Schiff base reaction was conducted in cells using Sc(OTf)3 as a catalyst, based on which the in situ synthesis of hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) was readily accomplished without external stimuli. The reversible Schiff base reaction&#8208;mediated intracellular Oswald ripening endows the HCOP with a woolen, spherical, hollow porous structure, and a large specific surface area. The intracellularly generated HCOP reduced cellular motility by restraining actin polymerization, which consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The presented Schiff base reaction&#8208;inspired intracellular synthesis system has strong potential to regulate cell fate and biological functions, opening up a new strategic possibility for intervening cellular behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>When is a bond broken? The polarizability perspective.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The question of when a chemical bond can be said to be broken is of fundamental chemical interest but has not been widely studied. Herein we propose that the maxima of static polarizability along bond dissociation coordinates naturally define cutoff points for bond rupture, as they represent the onset of localization of shared electron density into constituent fragments. Examples of computed polarizability maxima over the course of bond cleavage in main&#8208;group and transition metal compounds are provided, across covalent, dative and charge&#8208;shift bonds. The behavior along reaction paths is also considered. Overall, the static polarizability is found to be a sensitive reporter of electronic structure reorganization associated with bond stretching, and thus can serve as a metric for describing bond cleavage (or diagnose the absence of a chemical bond).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Stacking Modes of Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheet Membranes for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#160;metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#160;membranes are considered potential gas separation membranes of the next generation due to their structural diversity and geometrical functionality. However, achieving a rational structure design for a 2D MOF membrane and understanding the impact of MOF nanosheet stacking modes on membrane separation performance remain challenging tasks. Here, we report a novel kind of 2D MOF membrane based on [Cu2Br(IN)2]n (IN = isonicotinato) nanosheets and propose that synergetic stacking modes of nanosheets have a significant influence on gas separation performance. The stacking of the 2D MOF nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. Our 2D MOF nanosheet membranes exhibit high gas separation performances for H2/CH4 (selectivity &gt; 290 with H2 permeance &gt; 520 GPU) and H2/CO2 (selectivity &gt; 190 with H2 permeance &gt; 590 GPU) surpassing the Robeson upper bounds, paving a potential way for eco&#8208;friendly H2 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring a structurally editable proximal cofactor&#8208;like module to construct an artificial dual&#8208;center peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent novel strategy for constructing  artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that target new&#8208;to&#8208;nature functions use dual&#8208;functional small molecules (DFSMs) with catalytic and anchoring groups for converting P450BM3 monooxygenase to a peroxygenase. However, this process requires excess DFSMs (1000 equivalent of P450) owing to their low binding affinity for P450, thus severely limiting its practical application. Herein, structural optimization of the DFSM&#8208;anchoring group considerably enhanced their binding affinity by three orders of magnitude (Kd = ~10&#8208;8 M), thus approximating native cofactors, such as FMN or FAD in flavoenzymes. An artificial cofactor&#8208;driven peroxygenase was, thus, constructed. The co&#8208;crystal structure of P450BM3 bound to a DFSM clearly revealed a pre&#8208;catalytic state in which the DFSM participates in H2O2 activation, thus facilitating peroxygenase activity. Moreover, the increased binding affinity substantially decreases the DFSM load to as low as 2 equivalents of P450, while maintaining increased activity. Furthermore, replacement of catalytic groups showed disparate selectivity and activity for various substrates. This study provides an unprecedented approach for assembling ArMs by binding editable organic cofactors as a co&#8208;catalytic center, thereby increasing the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Work&#8208;Function&#8208;Induced Interfacial Electron/Ion Transport in Carbon Hosts toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupled electron/ion transport is a decisive feature of Li plating/stripping, wherein the compatibility of electron/ion transport rates determines the morphology of deposited Li. Local Li+ hotspots form due to inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer and lead to uncontrolled Li deposition, which decreases the Li utilization rate and safety of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a method to obtain dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes by driving electron pumping and accumulating and boosting Li ion diffusion by tuning the work function of a carbon host using cobalt&#8208;containing catalysts. The results reveal that increasing the work function provides an electron deviation from C to Co, and electron&#8208;rich Co shows favorable binding to Li+. The Co catalysts boost Li+ diffusion on the carbon fiber scaffolds without local aggregation by reducing the Li+ migration barrier. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibits a cycle life of over 2000 h with a plating areal capacity of 4 mA h cm&#8722;2, and a capacity retention of 83.4% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd Loaded NiCo Hydroxides for Biomass Electrooxidation: Understanding the Synergistic Effect of Proton Deintercalation and Adsorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key issue in the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is to understand the synergistic mechanism involving the protons deintercalation of catalyst and the adsorption of the substrate. In this study, a Pd/NiCo catalyst was fabricated by modifying Pd clusters onto a Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 support, in which the introduction of Co induced lattice distortion and optimized the energy band structure of Ni sites, while the Pd clusters with an average size of 1.96 nm exhibited electronic interactions with NiCo support, resulting in electron transfer from Pd to Ni sites. The resulting Pd/NiCo exhibited low onset potential of 1.32 V and achieved a current density of 50 mA/cm2 at only 1.38 V. Compared to unmodified Ni(OH)2, the Pd/NiCo achieved an 8.3&#8208;fold increase in peak current density. DFT calculations and in&#8208;situ XAFS revealed that the Co sites affected the conformation and band structure of neighboring Ni sites through CoO6 octahedral distortion, reducing the proton deintercalation potential of Pd/NiCo and promoting the production of Ni3+&#8208;O active species accordingly. The involvement of Pd decreased the electronic transfer impedance, and thereby accelerated Ni3+&#8208;O formation. Moreover, the Pd clusters enhanced the adsorption of HMF through orbital hybridization, kinetically promoting the contact and reaction of HMF with Ni3+&#8208;O.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis with Anomalous Chloride Promoted Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly selective and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is the bottleneck for direct seawater splitting because of side reactions primarily caused by chloride ions (Cl&#8208;). Most studies about OER catalysts in seawater focus on the repulsion of the Cl&#8208; to reduce its negative effects. Herein, we demonstrate that the absorption of Cl&#8208; on the specific site of a popular OER electrocatalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH), does not have a significant negative impact; rather, it is beneficial for its activity and stability enhancement in natural seawater. A set of in situ characterization techniques reveals that the adsorption of Cl&#8208; on the desired Fe site suppresses Fe leaching, and creates more OER&#8208;active Ni sites, improving the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability and activity simultaneously. Therefore, we achieve direct alkaline seawater electrolysis for the very first time on a commercial&#8208;scale alkaline electrolyser (AE, 120 cm2 electrode area) using the NiFe LDH anode. The new alkaline seawater electrolyser exhibits a reduction in electricity consumption by 20.7 % compared to the alkaline purified water&#8208;based AE using commercial Ni catalyst, achieving excellent durability for 100 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Transport and Evolution in Ni&#8208;MH Batteries by Neutron Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiency losses due to side reactions are one of the main challenges in battery development. Despite providing valuable insights, the results of standard analysis on the individual components cannot be simply extrapolated to the full operating system. Therefore, non&#8208;destructive, and high resolution approaches that allow the investigation of the full system are desired. Herein, we combined neutron radiography and tomography with electrical monitoring of the state of charge of commercial Ni&#8208;mischmetal hydride batteries, to track the exchange and transport of hydrogen under operating conditions. This non&#8208;destructive approach allowed both the quantification of the hydrogen distribution in the electrodes in 4D, and the distinction between the electrochemically exchanged hydrogen and the hydrogen gas pressure generated by side reactions, as a function of the applied potential and current. One of the most counter&#8208;intuitive observation is that the generation of hydrogen gas during discharge depends on the charging state of the battery. The results presented provide critical new insights in the mechanisms governing the electrochemical processes during Nimischmetal hydride battery operation, and also pave the way for the extrapolation of this approach to the investigation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ions batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Varying the Stiffness and Diffusivity of Rod&#8208;Shaped Microgels Independently through Their Molecular Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microgels are water&#8208;swollen, crosslinked polymers that are widely used as colloidal building blocks in scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Microgels can be controlled in their stiffness, degree of swelling, and mesh size depending on their polymer architecture, crosslink density, and fabrication method &#8211; all of which influence their function and interaction with the environment. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of soft microgels and how this morphology affects specific biomedical applications. In this report, we systematically vary the architecture and molar mass of polyethylene glycol&#8208;acrylate (PEG&#8208;Ac) precursors, as well as their concentration and combination, to gain insight in the different parameters that affect the internal structure of rod&#8208;shaped microgels. We characterize the mechanical properties and diffusivity, as well as the conversion of acrylate groups during photopolymerization, in both bulk hydrogels and microgels produced from the PEG&#8208;Ac precursors. Furthermore, we investigate cell&#8208;microgel interaction, and we observe improved cell spreading on microgels with more accessible RGD peptide and with a stiffness in a range of 20&#160;kPa to 50&#160;kPa lead to better cell growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Mo&#8208;Dependent Formylmethanofuran Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Massive efforts are invested in developing innovative CO2&#8208;sequestration strategies to counter climate change and transform CO2 into higher&#8208;value products. CO2&#8208;capture by reduction is a chemical challenge, and attention is turned toward biological systems that selectively and efficiently catalyse this reaction under mild conditions and in aqueous solvents. While few reports have evaluated the effectiveness of isolated bacterial formate dehydrogenases as catalysts for the reversible electrochemical reduction of CO2, it is imperative to explore other enzymes among the natural reservoir of potential models that might exhibit higher turnover rates or preferential directionality for the reductive reaction. Here, we present electroenzymatic catalysis of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, a CO2&#8208;reducing&#8208;and&#8208;fixing biomachinery isolated from a thermophilic methanogen, which was deposited on a graphite rod electrode to enable direct electron transfer for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction. The gas is reduced with a high Faradaic efficiency (109 &#177; 1%), where a low affinity for formate prevents its electrochemical reoxidation and favours formate accumulation. These properties make the enzyme an excellent tool for electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;fixation and inspiration for protein engineering that would be beneficial for biotechnological purposes to convert the greenhouse gas into stable formate that can subsequently be safely stored, transported, and used for power generation without energy loss.</dc:description>

         <title>StereoPHIP: Stereoselective Parahydrogen Induced Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) followed by polarization transfer to 13C is a rapidly developing technique for the generation of 13C hyperpolarized substrates. Chirality plays an essential role in living systems and differential metabolism of enantiomeric pairs of metabolic substrates is well documented. Inspired by asymmetric hydrogenation, here we report stereoPHIP, which involves the addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral substrate with a chiral catalyst followed by polarization transfer to 13C spins. We demonstrate that parahydrogen could be rapidly added to the prochiral precursor to both enantiomers of lactic acid (D and L), with both the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a chiral rhodium(I) catalyst to afford highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate ester derivatives, respectively, with excellent stereoselectivity. We also show that the hyperpolarized 1H signal decays obtained with the (R,R) and (S,S) catalysts were markedly different. StereoPHIP expands the scope of conventional PHIP to the production of 13C hyperpolarized chiral substrates with high stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn = 361.8 kg/mol, &#393; &lt; 1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.</dc:description>

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidically Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the natural confined enzyme on fluidic cell membrane, afluidically confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamers&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system with accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER can rapidly identified target cells in only 20 min, and achieved over 80% recognition efficiency with only 0.1% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and high selectivity of 97.1%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA = pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical NiH&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling of Alkyl Halides and Alkyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes for the construction of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bonds is firstly reported. Notably, alkyl halides serve dual function as coupling substrates and as hydrogen sources to generate NiH species under electrochemical conditions. The tunable nature of this reaction is realized by introducing an intramolecular coordinating group to the substrate, where the product can be easily adjusted to give the desired branched product. The method proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate scope, and affords moderate to excellent yields with over 70 examples, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug derivatives. Mechanistic insights offer evidence for an electrochemically driven coupling process. The sp3&#8208;carbon&#8211;halogen bonds can be activated through single electron transfer (SET) by the nickel catalyst in its low valence state, generated by cathodic reduction, and the generation of NiH species from alkyl halides is pivotal to this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergetic Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Sites on Organic Electrode Material for Robust and High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their sustainability and structural tunability. However, many OEMs suffer from low specific capacity and poor cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule called 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN&#8208;6OH) with catechol/ortho&#8208;quinone coupling functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. Through extensive analysis using density functional theory (DFT) calculation, ATR&#8208;FTIR, and Raman techniques, we have determined that the abundant coupling function groups and imine redox&#8208;active moieties on HATN&#8208;6OH enable a nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, resulting in a high specific capacity for sodium ion storage. Furthermore, the &#960;&#8208;&#960; coupling interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN&#8208;6OH molecules contribute to its resilient structural and chemical stability during cycling. As a result, our HATN&#8208;6OH electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacity (554 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1), excellent rate capability (202 mA h g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1), and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance (73% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1) in SIBs. This study highlights the importance of synergistic coupling of redox&#8208;active sites on OEMs in simultaneously enhancing capacity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Control of Carbon Nanoparticles via Simple Anion&#8208;Directed Strategy for Precise Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. And based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to  interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. Interestingly, the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs gradually enhances as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient up to 0.90.This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescence probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the &#8220;Solid&#8211;Liquid&#8211;Solid&#8221; Conversion Reaction via Bifunctional Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life Potassium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8211;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3 mol L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8211;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Enhancing Curcumin&#8208;Based Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Curcumin (Cur) has been clinically used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment by the means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and immune microenvironment regulation. However, this compound has a poor water solubility and moderate antioxidative activity, favoring no further broadened application. Metal complexes of curcumin such as zinc&#8208;curcumin (Zn&#8208;Cur) features enhanced water solubilities, while copper&#8208;curcumin (Cu&#8208;Cur) shows a higher antioxidant activity but lower solubility than Zn&#8208;Cur. Based on their inherent biological properties, this work proposes a nanomedicine&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange strategy to enhance the efficacy of Cur for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Copper silicate nanoparticles with hollow mesoporous structure were prepared to load water&#8208;soluble Zn&#8208;Cur for constructing a composite nanomedicine, which can degrade in acidic microenvironment of arthritic region, releasing Cu2+ and Zn&#8208;Cur. Cu2+ then substitute for Zn2+ in Zn&#8208;Cur to form Cu&#8208;Cur with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect, capable of efficiently scavenging ROS in M1 macrophages, promoting their transition to an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion&#8208;exchange strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselectivity of C&#8208;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98:2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm = bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8211;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt; 80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8211;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8208;Au(III)&#8208;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Geminal Cross Couplings of Dihaloalkanes with Cr Catalysis: Rapid Access to Tertiary and Quaternary Alkanes via a Metal&#8211;Carbene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable&#160;the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#160;cleavage of two&#160;geminal&#160;bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8211;C/C&#8211;Si or C&#8211;C/C&#8211;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada&#8208;type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C&#8211;halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8211;C and C&#8211;Si bonds via a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three&#8208;component geminal cross couplings are value&#8208;addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Porous Ionic Liquids for Coupling Natural Gas Purification with Waste Gas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry. We here report a type of porous ionic liquids (PILs) that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products. The PILs are synthesized through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step surface modification of ionic liquids (ILs) onto UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH nanocrystals. The introduction of free tertiary amine groups on the nanocrystal surface endows these PILs with an exceptional ability to enrich H2S from CO2 and CH4 with impressive selectivity, while the permanent pores of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH act as containers to store an exceptionally higher amount of the selectively captured H2S than the corresponding nonporous ILs. Simultaneously, the tertiary amines as dual functional moieties offer effective catalytic sites for the conversion of the H2S stored in PILs into 3&#8208;mercaptoisobutyric acid, a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Captopril (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations help understand both the mechanisms of separation and catalysis performance, confirming that the tertiary amines as well as the permanent pores in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH play vital roles in the whole procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Display Selection of a Hybrid Foldamer&#8208;Peptide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanding the chemical diversity of peptide macrocycle libraries for display selection is desirable to improve their potential at binding biomolecular targets. We now have implemented a considerable expansion through a large aromatic helical foldamer inclusion. A helical aromatic foldamer was identified that undergoes flexizyme&#8208;mediated tRNA acylation and is capable of initiating ribosomal translation with yields sufficiently high to perform an mRNA display selection of macrocyclic foldamer&#8208;peptide hybrids. A hybrid macrocyle nanomolar binder to the C&#8208;lobe of the E6AP HECT domain was selected that showed a highly converged peptide sequence. A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that both the peptide and foldamer are helical in an intriguing reciprocal stapling fashion. The strong residue convergence could be rationalized based on their involvement in specific interactions with the target protein. The foldamer stabilizes the peptide helix through stapling and through contacts with key residues. These results altogether represent a significant extension of the chemical space amenable to display selection and highlight possible benefits of inserting an aromatic foldamer into a peptide macrocycle for the purpose of protein recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete Peripheral Fluorination of the Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor in Organic Solar Cells Yields Efficiency over 19%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the intrinsically flexible molecular skeletons and loose aggregation, organic semiconductors, like small molecular acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), greatly suffer from larger structural/packing disorders and weaker intermolecular interactions comparing to their inorganic counterparts, further leading to hindered exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge carrier migration in resulting OSCs. To overcome this challenge, complete peripheral fluorination was performed on basis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series SMAs, rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding the molecular backbone. Benefitting from the broad 2D backbone, more importantly, strengthened fluorine&#8208;induced secondary interactions, CH8F and its D18 blends afford much enhanced and more ordered molecular packings accompanying with enlarged dielectric constants, reduced exciton binding energies and more obvious fibrillary networks comparing to CH6F controls. Consequently, D18:CH8F&#8208;based OSCs reached an excellent efficiency of 18.80%, much better than that of 17.91% for CH6F&#8208;based ones. More excitingly, by employing D18&#8208;Cl that possesses a highly similar structure to D18 as a third component, the highest efficiency of 19.28% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based OSCs has been achieved so far. Our work demonstrates the dramatical structural multiformity of CH&#8208;series SMAs, meanwhile, their high potential for constructing record&#8208;breaking OSCs through peripheral fine&#8208;tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence CuI/CuIII Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Non&#8208;innocent Ligand for Multielectron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report two novel three&#8208;dimensional copper&#8208;benzoquinoid metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu4L3]n and [Cu4L3&#183;Cu(iq)3]n (LH4 = 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahydroxybenzene, iq = isoquinoline). Spectroscopic techniques and computational studies reveal the unprecedented mixed valency in MOFs, formal Cu(I)/Cu(III). This is the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids. The coordination between the mixed&#8208;valence metal and redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent ligand L, which promotes through&#8208;bond charge transfer between Cu metal sites, allows better metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap of the d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, leading to strong long&#8208;range delocalization and semiconducting behavior. Our findings highlight the significance of the unique mixed valency between formal Cu(I) and highly&#8208;covalent Cu(III), non&#8208;innocent ligand, and pore environments of these bench stable Cu(III)&#8208;containing frameworks on multielectron transfer and electrochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2&#160;Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emission and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We prove that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in&#8208;situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in&#8208;situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote formation of *OCHO intermediate, but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OHeq)2(OAcax)2]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long&#8208;circulating tumor&#8208;targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well. The complexes showed massively prolonged plasma half&#8208;life and distinctly improved anticancer activity in vivo compared to oxaliplatin. Taken together, the newly developed synthetic platform allows the simple and specific insertion of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes. This will enable the attachment of three different (bioactive) moieties generating targeted triple&#8208;action platinum(IV) prodrugs within one single platinum complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions between Polyvinyl Chloride and Conjugated Polymers Enable Excellent Mechanical Properties and High Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of insulating polymers into conjugated polymers has been widely explored as a strategy to improve mechanical properties of flexible organic electronics. However, phase separation due to the immiscibility of these polymers has limited their effectiveness. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel non&#8208;covalent interaction that enhances the miscibility between insulating and conjugated polymers, resulting in improved mechanical properties. Specifically, we added polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to the conjugated polymer PM6 and observed a significant increase in solution viscosity, indicative of favorable miscibility between the two polymers. This phenomenon has been rarely observed in other insulating/conjugated polymer composites. Thin films of PM6/PVC exhibited a much&#8208;improved crack&#8208;onset strain of 19.35%, compared to 10.12% for pristine PM6 films. Analysis revealed that a "cyclohexyl&#8208;like" structure formed through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVC and PM6 acted as a cross&#8208;linking site in the thin films, leading to improved mechanical properties. Moreover, PM6/PVC blend films demonstrated excellent thermal and bending stability when applied as an electron donor in organic solar cells. These findings provide new insights into non&#8208;covalent molecular interactions that can be utilized to enhance the properties of conjugated polymers and may have potential applications in flexible organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Delocalization Enables Sulfone&#8208;based Single&#8208;solvent Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMB), although providing high energy density, face the grand challenge of identifying good electrolyte solvents for cycling. Common solvents are either stable against lithium metal anode or stable against LiNixMnyCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. An example is the sulfone solvent. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the solvent electrons by introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li+. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMBs under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21 mg/cm2 NMC811 and 50 &#956;m Li) with 90% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.</dc:description>
