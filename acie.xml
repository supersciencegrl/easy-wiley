         <title>Acetamide Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrite in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable electricities driven&#160;electrocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction&#160;reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8208;N chemicals from CO2&#160;and nitrogen species. However,&#160;it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2&#160;and NO3&#8208;/NO2&#8208;&#160;to generate aldoxime&#160;an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling process.&#160;Herein, we report&#160;the successful&#160;electrochemical conversion of CO2&#160;and NO2&#8208;&#160;to acetamide for&#160;the first time&#160;over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce&#160;acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2&#160;and wastewater.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting &#960; and Chalcogen Interactions for the &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Indoles through Glycal Conformational Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing productive chalcogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, a phosphonoselenide catalyst was used for stereoselective C,N&#8208;glycosylation. This unique activation manifold distorts the glycal conformation and enables both the C3 and N1 positions of indole to be appended directly to the anomeric position of glycals, thus providing access to an array of biologically important &#946;&#8208;indolyl glycosides.







Abstract
Harnessing unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) is emerging as a formidable synthetic approach in difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access glycosidic chemical space. C&#8208;Glycosylation, in particular, has gained a flurry of recent attention. However, most reported methods are restricted to the relatively facile access to &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides. Herein, we disclose a &#946;&#8208;stereoselective glycosylation of indoles by employing a phosphonoselenide catalyst. The robustness of this protocol is exemplified by its amenability for reaction at both the indolyl C&#8208; and N&#8208; reactivity sites. In contrast to previous reports, in which the chalcogens were solely involved in Lewis acidic activation, our mechanistic investigation unraveled that the often neglected flanking aromatic substituents of phosphonoselenides can substantially contribute to catalysis by engaging in &#960;&#8208;interactions. Computations and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the chalcogenic and aromatic components of the catalyst can be collectively exploited to foster conformational distortion of the glycal away from the usual half&#8208;chair to the boat conformation, which liberates the convex &#946;&#8208;face for nucleophilic attack.

         <title>An Intelligent DNA Nanoreactor for Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Read In Vivo Tumor Imaging and Precise Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) following an &#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm was constructed. iDNR exhibits superior stability, improved binding affinity, and superior targeting/retention capability. It addresses previous limitations such as always &#8220;ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, off&#8208;target effects, and high cost. Therefore, it enables the development of similar iDNRs for various biomedical applications.







Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;based in vivo tumor imaging and therapy have attracted extensive attention; however, they suffer from the unintelligent &#8220;always ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, substantial off&#8208;target effects, and high cost. Therefore, achieving in vivo easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging and precise therapy in a multi&#8208;parameter responsive and intelligent manner remains challenging. Herein, an intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) was constructed following the &#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm to address these issues. iDNR&#8208;mediated in situ deposition of photothermal substance polydopamine (PDA) can only be satisfied in tumor tissues with abundant membrane protein biomarkers &#8220;AND&#8221; hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Therefore, intelligent temperature&#8208;based in vivo easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging is realized without expensive instrumentation, and its diagnostic performance matches with that of flow cytometry, and photoacoustic imaging. Moreover, precise photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors could be achieved via intelligent heating of tumor tissues. The precise PTT of primary tumors in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy suppresses the growth of distant tumors and inhibits tumor recurrence. Therefore, highly programmable iDNR is a powerful tool for intelligent biomedical applications.

         <title>Rare Earth Evoked Subsurface Oxygen Species in Platinum Alloy Catalysts Enable Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing rare earth bonded subsurface oxygen atoms into Pt3Ni via a high temperature entropy&#8208;driven process, we have addressed the Pt degradation issue via delaying the place exchange between adsorbed oxygen species and surface Pt atoms. The Gd&#8722;O&#8722;Pt3Ni catalyst has achieved high mass activity and high durability simultaneously under low platinum group metal (PGM) loading in PEMFCs.







Abstract
Alleviating the degradation issue of Pt based alloy catalysts, thereby simultaneously achieving high mass activity and high durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), is highly challenging. Herein, we provide a new paradigm to address this issue via delaying the place exchange between adsorbed oxygen species and surface Pt atoms, thereby inhibiting Pt dissolution, through introducing rare earth bonded subsurface oxygen atoms. We have succeeded in introducing Gd&#8722;O dipoles into Pt3Ni via a high temperature entropy&#8208;driven process, with direct spectral evidence attained from both soft and hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The higher rated power of 0.93&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and superior current density of 562.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;V than DOE target for heavy&#8208;duty vehicles in H2&#8208;air mode suggest the great potential of Gd&#8722;O&#8722;Pt3Ni towards practical application in heavy&#8208;duty transportation. Moreover, the mass activity retention (1.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) after 40&#8197;k cycles accelerated durability tests is even 2.4&#8197;times of the initial mass activity goal for DOE 2025 (0.44&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1), due to the weakened Pt&#8722;Oads bond interaction and the delayed place exchange process, via repulsive forces between surface O atoms and those in the sublayer. This work addresses the critical roadblocks to the widespread adoption of PEMFCs.

         <title>Topological Single&#8208;stranded DNA Encoding and Programmable Assembly of Molecular Nanostructures for NIR&#8208;II Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial base&#8208;directed topological DNA&#8208;encoding strategy is reported as a versatile platform for engineering NIR&#8208;II nanomedicine with programmable assembly and precise control over composition and surface valence. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies were performed to engineer Ag2S&#8208;DNA QDs and CuS&#8208;DNA nanodots, demonstrating strong emission or absorption in the NIR&#8208;II window favorable for applications in bioimaging and deep&#8208;penetration tumor therapy.







Abstract
Molecular nanotechnology promises to offer privileged access to developing NIR&#8208;II materials with precise structural and functional manipulation for transformable theranostic applications. However, the lack of an affordable, yet general, method makes this goal currently inaccessible. By virtue of the intriguing nucleic acid chemistry, here we present an artificial base&#8208;directed topological single&#8208;strand DNA encoding design that enables one&#8208;step synthesis of valence&#8208;controlled NIR&#8208;II molecular nanostructures and spatial assembly of these nanostructures to modulate their behaviors in living systems. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies, we construct ultrasmall Ag2S quantum dots and pH&#8208;responsive, size&#8208;tunable CuS assemblies for in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and deep tumor photothermal therapy. This work paves a new way for creating functionally diversified architectures and broadens the scope of DNA&#8208;encoded material engineering.

Proof-of-principle studies were performed to engineer Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-DNA QDs and CuS-DNA nanodots, demonstrating strong emission or absorption in the NIR-II window favorable for applications in bioimaging and deep-penetration tumor therapy.

         <title>Selective Hemin Binding by a Non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex Aptamer with Higher Affinity and Better Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using capture&#8208;SELEX, a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer for selective hemin binding was obtained, and it did not bind to closely related protoporphyrin IX. The new aptamer doubled heat release compared to a classical G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer, indicating a fundamentally different way of hemin binding.







Abstract
Previous aptamers for porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were all guanine&#8208;rich sequences that can fold in G&#8208;quadruplex structures. Due to stacking&#8208;based binding, these aptamers can hardly tell different porphyrins apart, and they can also bind other planar molecules, hindering their practical applications. In this work, we used the capture selection method to obtain aptamers for hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The hemin aptamer (Hem1) features two highly conserved repeating binding loops, and it cannot form a G&#8208;quadruplex, which was supported by its Mg2+&#8208;dependent but K+&#8208;independent hemin binding and CD spectroscopy. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed much higher enthalpy change for the new aptamer, and the best aptamer showed a Kd of 43&#8197;nM hemin. Hem1 can also enhance the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of hemin. This work demonstrates that aptamers have alternative ways to bind porphyrins allowing selective recognition of different porphyrins.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Cleavable Aromatic Polymers for the Fabrication of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Plastics with High Mechanical Strength and Excellent Chemical Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversibly cross&#8208;linked plastics with high strength and excellent chemical resistance are fabricated by copolymerizing aromatic amines and aldehydes with dynamic imine bonds. After depolymerization in acidic solutions, the corresponding monomers can be efficiently separated through their solubility difference in selective solvents or monomer conversion strategy to realize closed&#8208;loop recycling.







Abstract
Although closed&#8208;loop recycling of dynamic covalent bond&#8208;based plastics does not require catalysts, their mechanical strength and chemical stability remain a major concern. In this study, closed&#8208;loop recyclable poly(aryl imine) (PAI) plastics with high mechanical strength and excellent chemical resistance are fabricated by copolymerizing aromatic amines and aromatic aldehydes through dynamic imine bonds. The resulting PAI plastic with a tensile strength of 58.2&#8197;MPa exhibits excellent chemical resistance and mechanical stability in acidic and basic aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. The PAI plastics can be depolymerized in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/HCl aqueous solution through the dissociation of imine bonds, and the monomers can be facilely recovered with high purity and isolated yields due to the solubility difference between the aromatic amines and aromatic aldehydes in selective solvents. The efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling of the PAI plastic can also be realized through monomer conversion because the hydrolysis of the aromatic aldehydes generates aromatic amines. The recovered monomers can be used to re&#8208;fabricate original PAI plastics. This PAI plastic can be selectively recovered from complicated mixed polymer waste streams due to the mild depolymerization conditions of the PAI plastic and its high stability in most organic solvents.

An unprecedented (4+4) cycloaddition of simple 1,3&#8208;dienes with azadienes is achieved by &#960;&#8208;Lewis basic palladium (0) catalysis, delivering benzofuran&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in high efficiency, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented enantioselective (4+4) cycloaddition of simple 1,3&#8208;dienes with azadienes for the construction of fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. In this transformation, the &#960;&#8208;Lewis basic Pd(0) catalyst achieves activation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to induce nucleophilic addition to azadienes followed by ring cyclization via a selective terminal allylic substitution. Furthermore, highly efficient and diastereoselective derivatizations of the eight&#8208;membered rings provide a facile access to diverse enantiopure fused tetra&#8208; to hexacyclic compounds with potential application in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Cyano&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks from Water, Air and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work not only provides new insights into the design of COFs by regulating the amount of charge transfer channels and enhancing the rate&#8208;determining two&#8208;electron water oxidation to boost H2O2 photosynthesis, but also paves the way for the practical application of COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts in solar&#8208;driven synthesis.







Abstract
The insufficient exciton (e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pair) separation/transfer and sluggish two&#8208;electron water oxidation are two main factors limiting the H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts. Herein, we present an alternative strategy to simultaneously facilitate exciton separation/transfer and reduce the energy barrier of two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COFs via a dicyano functionalization. The in situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the dicyano functionalization improves the amount of charge transfer channels between donor and acceptor units from two in COF&#8208;0CN without cyano functionalization to three in COF&#8208;1CN with mono&#8208;cyano functionalization and four in COF&#8208;2CN with dicyano functionalization, leading to the highest separation/transfer efficiency in COF&#8208;2CN. More importantly, the dicyano group activates the neighbouring C atom to produce the key *OH intermediate for effectively reducing the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining two&#8208;electron water oxidation in H2O2 photosynthesis. The simultaneously enhanced exciton separation/transfer and two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COF&#8208;2CN result in high H2O2 yield (1601&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) from water and oxygen without using sacrificial reagent under visible&#8208;light irradiation. COF&#8208;2CN can effectively yield H2O2 in water with wide pH range, in different real water samples, in scaled&#8208;up reactor under natural sunlight irradiation, and in continuous&#8208;flow reactor for consecutively producing H2O2 solution for water decontamination.

         <dc:description>
A 1&#8208;million&#8208;fold variability in the affinity of a multicharged host toward a guest ion highlights the pivotal role of self&#8208;ion pairing in host&#8211;guest chemistry in aqueous solution. These findings call for a critical reassessment of the existing data pertaining to multicharged receptors, emphasizing the need to specify concentration as a key element when reporting the complexation ability of these supramolecular hosts.







Abstract
The determination of binding constants is a key matter in evaluating the strength of host&#8211;guest interactions. However, the profound impact of self&#8208;ion pairing on this parameter is often underrated in aqueous solution, leading in some cases to a misinterpretation of the true potential of supramolecular assemblies. In the present study, we aim to shed further light on this critical factor by exploring the concentration&#8208;dependent behavior of a multicharged pillararene in water. Our observations reveal an extraordinary 1&#8208;million&#8208;fold variability in the affinity of this macrocycle toward a given anion, showcasing the highly dynamic character of electrostatic interactions. We argue that these findings bring to the forefront the inherent determinism that underlies the estimation of affinity constants, a factor profoundly shaped by both the sensitivity of the instrumental technique in use and the intricacies of the experimental design itself. In terms of applications, these results may provide the opportunity to optimize the operational concentrations of multicharged hosts in different scenarios, aiming to achieve their maximum efficiency based on the intended application. Unlocking the potential of this hidden variability may pave the way for the creation of novel molecular materials with advanced functionalities.

&lt;p&gt;A 1-million-fold variability in the affinity of a multicharged host toward a guest ion highlights the pivotal role of self-ion pairing in host&#8211;guest chemistry in aqueous solution. These findings call for a critical reassessment of the existing data pertaining to multicharged receptors, emphasizing the need to specify concentration as a key element when reporting the complexation ability of these supramolecular hosts.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Pentlandite by High&#8208;Spin State Iron for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;spin state of Fe in Fe5Ni4S8 promotes the accumulation of surface OH&#8722; and accelerates the rate of electron transfer, thereby establishing a correlation with the kinetic rate of the reconstructive reaction.







Abstract
Triggering rapid reconstruction reactions holds the potential to approach the theoretical limits of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and spin state manipulation has shown great promise in this regard. In this study, the transition of Fe spin states from low to high was successfully achieved by adjusting the surface electronic structure of pentlandite. In situ characterization and kinetic simulations confirmed that the high&#8208;spin state of Fe promoted the accumulation of OH&#8722; on the surface and accelerated electron transfer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the reconstruction reaction. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that the lower d&#8208;band center of high&#8208;spin Fe optimized the adsorption of active intermediates, thereby enhancing the reconstruction kinetics. Remarkably, pentlandites with high&#8208;spin Fe exhibited ultra&#8208;low overpotential (245&#8197;mV&#8201;@&#8201;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and excellent stability. These findings provided new insights for the design and fabrication of highly active OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Simple Molecules under High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Conditions: Synthesis and Characterization of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2 with Fully sp3&#8208;Hybridized Carbon</title>

         <dc:description>
Malononitrile, dicyandiamide, and melamine were subjected to high pressures and temperatures in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, mimicking conditions that prevail inside Uranus and Neptune. This yielded &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2, both with fully sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. The former adopts a distorted &#946;&#8208;cristobalite structure, while the latter is built from imide&#8208;bridged hexaazaadamantane units, which form two interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like networks.







Abstract
The elements hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen are among the most abundant in the solar system. Still, little is known about the ternary compounds these elements can form under the high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions found in the outer planets&#8217; interiors. These materials are also of significant research interest since they are predicted to feature many desirable properties such as high thermal conductivity and hardness due to strong covalent bonding networks. In this study, the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction behavior of malononitrile H2C(CN)2, dicyandiamide (H2N)2C=NCN, and melamine (C3N3)(NH2)3 was investigated in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. Two previously unknown compounds, namely &#945;&#8208;C(NH)2 and &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2, have been synthesized and found to have fully sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. &#945;&#8208;C(NH)2 crystallizes in a distorted &#946;&#8208;cristobalite structure, while &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2 is built from previously unknown imide&#8208;bridged 2,4,6,8,9,10&#8208;hexaazaadamantane units, which form two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like networks. Their stability domains and compressibility were studied, for which supporting density functional theory calculations were performed.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Iridium(III) and Iridium(IV) Oxo Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation by two isostructural, terminal iridium(III) and iridium(IV) oxo complexes is compared. While the driving forces for hydrogen abstraction are almost identical due to compensating contributions from H+ and e&#8722; transfer, significant differences in hydrogen tunneling were observed. Increased tunneling for the iridium(III) oxo complex is attributed to its higher basicity, which leads to a narrower potential energy barrier. Our results provide guidelines to steer C&#8722;H activation under tunneling control.







Abstract
Oxidation of an iridium(III) oxo precursor enabled the structural, spectroscopic, and quantum&#8208;chemical characterization of the first well&#8208;defined iridium(IV) oxo complex. Side&#8208;by&#8208;side examination of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer thermochemistry revealed similar driving forces for the isostructural oxo complexes in two redox states due to compensating contributions from H+ and e&#8722; transfer. However, C&#8722;H activation of dihydroanthracene revealed significant hydrogen tunneling for the distinctly more basic iridium(III) oxo complex. Our findings complement the growing body of data that relate tunneling to ground state properties as predictors for the selectivity of C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Pt/MnO Interface Induced Defects for High Reverse Water Gas Shift Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the result of edge dislocations generated at the Pt/MnO interface, linearly adsorbed CO is destabilized and released fast from the Pt nanoparticle. This leads to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS reaction.







Abstract
The implementation of supported metal catalysts heavily relies on the synergistic interactions between metal nanoparticles and the material they are dispersed on. It is clear that interfacial perimeter sites have outstanding skills for turning catalytic reactions over, however, high activity and selectivity of the designed interface&#8208;induced metal distortion can also obtain catalysts for the most crucial industrial processes as evidenced in this paper. Herein, the beneficial synergy established between designed Pt nanoparticles and MnO in the course of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction resulted in a Pt/MnO catalyst having &#8776;10&#8197;times higher activity compared to the reference Pt/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst with &gt;99&#8201;% CO selectivity. Under activation, a crystal assembly through the metallic Pt (110) and MnO evolved, where the plane distance differences caused a mismatched&#8208;row structure in softer Pt nanoparticles, which was identified by microscopic and surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic characterizations combined with density functional theory simulations. The generated edge dislocations caused the Pt lattice expansion which led to the weakening of the Pt&#8722;CO bond. Even though MnO also exhibited an adverse effect on Pt by lowering the number of exposed metal sites, rapid desorption of the linearly adsorbed CO species governed the performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Photosensitizer with High Enrichment in Tumor Cells Based on a Multi&#8208;Effect Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a multi&#8208;effect &#8220;1&#8208;to&#8208;3&#8221; strategy&#8212;one enzymatic stimulus leads to three effects&#8212;with the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable, tumor cell&#8208;targeting fluorogenic probe and photosensitizer (PS). This PS is selectively activated by alkaline phosphatase, which is overexpressed in tumor cells and causes enrichment of the PS in these cells upon a change in hydrophobicity, resulting in turn&#8208;on near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photosensitizing ability.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes and photosensitizers (PSs) have emerged as promising tools for molecular imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, in living organisms selective retention or even enrichment of these reagents after enzymatic activation at or near sites of interest remains a challenging task. Herein, we integrate non&#8208;covalent and covalent retention approaches to introduce a novel &#8220;1&#8208;to&#8208;3&#8221; multi&#8208;effect strategy&#8212;one enzymatic stimulus leads to three types of effects&#8212;for the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable NIR probe or PS. Using this strategy, we have constructed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;activatable NIR fluorogenic probe and a NIR PS, which proved to be selectively activated by ALP to switch on NIR fluorescence or photosensitizing ability, respectively. Additionally, these reagents showed significant enrichment (over 2000&#8208;fold) in ALP&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells compared to the culture medium, accompanied by massive depletion of intracellular thiols, the major antioxidants in cells. The investigation of this ALP&#8208;activatable NIR PS in an in vivo PDT model resulted in complete suppression of HeLa tumors and full recovery of all tested mice. Encouragingly, even a single administration of this NIR PS was sufficient to completely suppress tumors in mice, demonstrating the high potential of this strategy in biomedical applications.

         <title>Coupling Electrochemical Sulfion Oxidation with CO2 Reduction over Highly Dispersed p&#8208;Bi Nanosheets and CO2&#8208;Assisted Sulfur Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfion electro&#8208;oxidation coupled CO2 reduction system for the co&#8208;productions of formate and sulfur was constructed to lower electricity consumption. Meantime, a novel, low cost and environmentally friendly CO2&#8208;assisted sulfur separation technique was developed, and the by&#8208;product NaHCO3 can be used as electrolyte for cathodic CO2RR or in other chemical industry technologies.







Abstract
We report herein an electrocatalytic CO2 reduction&#8208;coupled sulfion oxidation system for the co&#8208;productions of valuable formate and sulfur at much enhanced atom utilization. Specifically, an organic ligand&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step reconstruction approach has been developed to fabricate the highly dispersed p&#8208;Bi nanosheets (p&#8208;Bi NSs) for cathodic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and meanwhile porous Co&#8722;S nanosheets (Co&#8722;S NSs) was applied for anodic sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR). Significantly high Faradaic Efficiencies of about 90&#8201;% for formate production by CO2RR in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and excellent SOR performances including an ultra&#8208;low onset potential of about 0.2&#8197;V and recycle capacity of S2&#8722; in the 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M S2&#8722; solutions, have been simultaneously achieved. In the meantime, both the structure transformation of the catalysts and the reaction pathways are explored and discussed in detail. A two&#8208;electrode CO2RR||SOR electrolyzer equipped with above electrocatalysts has been established, which features as low as about 1.5&#8197;V to run the electrolyzer at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, manifesting extremely lowered electricity consumption in comparison to conventional CO2RR system. Moreover, a sulfur separation approach has been proposed by using CO2, which is efficient, environmentally friendly and cost effective with value&#8208;added NaHCO3 be obtained as the byproduct.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Hydroarylation(Alkenylation) of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Access (&#8722;CF2H) Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically bulky NHC&#8208;nickel catalyst promoted site&#8208;selective hydroarylation(alkenylation) of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes by coupling with organotriflates(bromides) and sodium 1&#8208;phenylethoxide as hydride source to furnish products containing CF2H&#8208;substituted carbon centers. Experimental and computational studies shed light on the non&#8208;radical mechanism and the metal alkoxide's role in facilitating the reaction.







Abstract
An emerging class of C&#8722;C coupling transformations that furnish drug&#8208;like building blocks involves catalytic hydrocarbonation of alkenes. However, despite notable advances in the field, hydrocarbon addition to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes without additional electronic activation remains largely unsuccessful. This owes partly to poor reactivity and the propensity of difluoroalkenes to undergo defluorinative side reactions. Here, we report a nickel catalytic system that promotes efficient 1,2&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation, suppressing defluorination and providing straightforward access to a diverse assortment of prized organofluorides bearing difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted carbon centers. In contrast to radical&#8208;based pathways and reactions triggered by hydrometallation via a nickel&#8208;hydride complex, our experimental and computational studies support a mechanism in which a catalytically active nickel&#8208;bromide species promotes selective carbonickelation with difluoroalkenes followed by alkoxide exchange and hydride transfer, effectively overcoming the difluoroalkene's intrinsic electronic bias.

         <title>Vinylogous Urea &#8208; Urethane Vitrimers: Accelerating and Inhibiting Network Dynamics through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylogous urethane (VUO) based polymer networks are widely used as catalyst&#8208;free vitrimers that show rapid covalent bond exchange at elevated temperatures. In solution, vinylogous ureas (VUN) undergo much faster bond exchange than VUO and are highly dynamic at room temperature. However, this difference in reactivity is not observed in their respective dynamic polymer networks, as VUO and VUN vitrimers prepared herein with very similar macromolecular architectures show comparable stress relaxation and creep behavior. However, by using mixtures of VUO and VUN linkages within the same network, the dynamic reactions can be accelerated by an order of magnitude. The results can be rationalized by the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is absent in VUO vitrimers, but is very pronounced for vinylogous urea moieties. At low concentrations of VUN, these hydrogen bonds act as catalysts for covalent bond exchange, while at high concentration, they provide a pervasive vinylogous urea &#8208; urethane (VU) network of strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, giving rise to phase separation and inhibiting polymer chain dynamics. This offers a straightforward design principle for dynamic polymer materials, showing at the same time the possible additive and synergistic effects of supramolecular and dynamic covalent polymer networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Stable Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enables High&#8208;temperature, High&#8208;voltage Li||LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin and uniform CEI with LiBxOy/LiF&#8208;rich outer layer and LiF&#8208;rich inner layer derived by TTFPB additive exhibits high thermostability and mechanical stability, which substantially mitigated the cracking and reconstruction of CEI and irreversible phase transition of the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage and high&#8208;operating temperature.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li||LiCoO2 batteries is severely limited by the instability of cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage and high temperature. Here we propose a mechanically and thermally stable CEI by electrolyte designing for achieving the exceptional performance of Li||LiCoO2 batteries at 4.6&#8197;V and 70&#8201;&#176;C. 2,4,6&#8208;tris(3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)boroxin (TTFPB) as the additive could preferentially enter into the first shell structure of PF6&#8722; solvation and be decomposed on LiCoO2 surface at low oxidation potential to generate a LiBxOy&#8208;rich/LiF&#8208;rich CEI. The LiBxOy surface layer effectively maintained the integrity of CEI and provided excellent mechanical and thermal stability while abundant LiF in CEI further improved the thermal stability and homogeneity of CEI. Such CEI drastically alleviated the crack and regeneration of CEI and irreversible phase transformation of the cathode. As expected, the Li||LiCoO2 batteries with the tailored CEI achieved 91.9&#8201;% and 74.0&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 and 150&#8197;cycles at 4.6 and 4.7&#8197;V, respectively. Moreover, such batteries also delivered an unprecedented high&#8208;temperature performance with 73.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 4.6&#8197;V.

&lt;p&gt;A thin and uniform CEI with LiB&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/LiF-rich outer layer and LiF-rich inner layer derived by TTFPB additive exhibits high thermostability and mechanical stability, which substantially mitigated the cracking and reconstruction of CEI and irreversible phase transition of the cathode at high cut-off voltage and high-operating temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high-energy-density Li||LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is severely limited by the instability of cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage and high temperature. Here we propose a mechanically and thermally stable CEI by electrolyte designing for achieving the exceptional performance of Li||LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries at 4.6&#8197;V and 70&#8201;&#176;C. 2,4,6-tris(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)boroxin (TTFPB) as the additive could preferentially enter into the first shell structure of PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; solvation and be decomposed on LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface at low oxidation potential to generate a LiB&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;-rich/LiF-rich CEI. The LiB&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; surface layer effectively maintained the integrity of CEI and provided excellent mechanical and thermal stability while abundant LiF in CEI further improved the thermal stability and homogeneity of CEI. Such CEI drastically alleviated the crack and regeneration of CEI and irreversible phase transformation of the cathode. As expected, the Li||LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with the tailored CEI achieved 91.9&#8201;% and 74.0&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 and 150&#8197;cycles at 4.6 and 4.7&#8197;V, respectively. Moreover, such batteries also delivered an unprecedented high-temperature performance with 73.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 4.6&#8197;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Fully&#8208;Substituted and Configuration&#8208;Defined Alkyl Vinyl Ethers Enabled by Dual&#8208;Functional Copper&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) using simple chemical feedstocks. The distinctive approach involves the chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of the CF2 unit in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with O&#8208;H and C&#8208;H nucleophiles in a specific order. The resulting highly functionalized cyclopropanyl ethers then undergo a stereoselective ring&#8208;opening process to produce fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined AVEs. These AVEs are rarely accessible through conventional methods and are easily transformable. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the success of this method relies on the use of dual&#8208;functional copper catalysis, which is involved in both the functionalization of the CF2 unit and the subsequent ring&#8208;opening process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;N2 Batteries with Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation and Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;N2 batteries have received widespread attention for their potential to integrate N2 fixation, energy storage, and conversion. However, because of the low activity and poor stability of cathode catalysts, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;N2 batteries is suboptimal, and their electrochemical reversibility has rarely been proven. In this study, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system was established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. The Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities, and the photogenerated electrons and hot electrons are remarkably beneficial for accelerating the discharge and charge reaction kinetics. These advantages enable the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery to achieve a low overpotential of 1.32 V, which is the lowest overpotential reported to date, as well as superior rate capability and prolonged cycle stability (~500 h). Remarkably, a combination of theoretical and experimental results demonstrates the high reversibility of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery. The proposed novel strategy for developing efficient cathode catalysts and fabricating photo&#8208;assisted battery systems breaks through the overpotential bottleneck of Li&#8208;N2 batteries, providing important insights into the mechanism underlying N2 fixation and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8211;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68% to 76%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8226;&#8722; and &#8226;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Intensified Continuous Flow Process for the Scalable Production of Bio&#8208;Based Glycerol Carbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A subtle combination of fundamental and applied organic chemistry toward process intensification is demonstrated for the large&#8208;scale production of bio&#8208;based glycerol carbonate under flow conditions. The direct carbonation of bio&#8208;based glycidol with CO2 is successfully carried out under intensified flow conditions, with Barton&#8217;s base as a potent homogeneous organocatalyst. Process metrics for the CO2 coupling step (for the upstream production, output: 3.6 kg day&#8208;1, Space Time Yield (STY): 2.7 kg h&#8208;1 L&#8208;1, Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor): 4.7) outclass previous reports. High conversion and selectivity are achieved in less than 30 s of residence time at pilot scale with a stoichiometric amount of CO2. Supporting DFT computations reveal the unique features of the mechanism in presence of Br&#248;nsted bases.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0 nm &#215; 6.0 nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8211; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0 nm &#215; 6.0 nm) transition-metal&#8211;lanthanide co-encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B-&#945;-TeW9O33]9}288&#8211; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry-unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten-oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain-targeted peptide to prepare a brain-targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate glioma cell apoptosis pathway with a low half-maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66 &#956;M). As the first brain-targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma-bearing mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Regioselective Diborylation of Aryllithium with Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free highly regioselective and efficient o&#8208;diborylation of aryllithium with tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) has been developed, leading to a family of o&#8208;diborylarenes in very good yields under mild reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that an aromatic nucleophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H substitution pathway may be involved.







Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;diborylation of aryllithium with tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) has been achieved, giving a series of 1,2&#8208;diborylaryl lithium species in excellent yields under mild reaction conditions, which leads to 1,2&#8208;di(tolyl)borylarenes in 60&#8211;91&#8201;% yields upon treatment with the hydride&#8208;abstracting reagent. In these transformations, one sp2 C&#8722;H of arene is activated and both boryl units are utilized to build two new (sp2)C&#8722;B bonds. This represents a new strategy for selective arene diborylation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that an aromatic nucleophilic substitution is a key step in the formation of the products.

         <title>In Situ Chiral Template Approach to Synthesize Homochiral Lead Iodides for Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ chiral template approach has been developed for the synthesis of homochiral lead iodides, demonstrating the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the second&#8208;harmonic generation response.







Abstract
Homochiral halide perovskites have gained increasing attention because of their fascinating optoelectronic properties and prospective applications in laser technologies. However, the limited choice of chiral organic templates severely restricts their structural diversity and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) effects. Here, we present an in situ chiral template approach for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) homochiral lead iodides. A chiral imine (L&#8208;ipp) template was generated in situ by reacting L&#8208;proline (L&#8208;pro) and acetone under ambient conditions. Notably, L&#8208;ipp can cooperate with L&#8208;pro to direct the formation of a homochiral lead iodide with dual chiral templates, which is unprecedented in crystalline metal halides. The homochiral lead iodide containing both L&#8208;ipp and L&#8208;pro shows a strong SHG response of 8.0&#8197;times that of KH2PO4 (8.0&#215;KDP). The SHG efficiency is one of the largest values reported to date for any homochiral lead halides under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. A comparative study shows that homochiral 1D lead iodides containing either L&#8208;ipp or L&#8208;pro exhibit relatively weak SHG responses (&#8804;1.0&#215;KDP). This work demonstrates the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the SHG responses of halide materials.

         <title>Single Idiosyncratic Ionic Generator Working in Iso&#8208;Osmotic Solutions Via Ligand Confined Assembled in Gaps Between Nanosheets</title>

         <dc:description>
An artificial potassium ionic channel for mimicking biological iso&#8208;osmotic energy conversion system, which is achieved by the confined assembly of potassium ligand in the gaps between GO nanosheets.







Abstract
Numerous reported bioinspired osmotic energy conversion systems employing cation&#8208;/anion&#8208;selective membranes and solutions with different salinity are actually far from the biological counterpart. The iso&#8208;osmotic power generator with the specific ionic permselective channels (e.g., K+ or Na+ channels) which just allow specific ions to get across and iso&#8208;osmotic solutions still remain challenges. Inspired by nature, we report a bioinspired K+&#8208;channel by employing a K+ selective ligand, 1,1,1&#8208;tris{[(2&#8242;&#8208;benzylaminoformyl)phenoxy]methyl}ethane (BMP) and graphene oxide membrane. Specifically, the K+ and Na+ selectivity of the prepared system could reach up to &#8776;17.8, and the molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the excellent permselectivity of K+ mainly stemmed from the formed suitable channel size. Thus, we assembled the K+&#8208;selective iso&#8208;osmotic power generator (KSIPG) with the power density up to &#8776;15.1&#8197;mW/m2 between equal concentration solutions, which is higher than traditional charge&#8208;selective osmotic power generator (CSOPG). The proposed strategy has well shown the realizable approach to construct single&#8208;ion selective channels&#8208;based highly efficient iso&#8208;osmotic energy conversion systems and would surely inspire new applications in other fields, including self&#8208;powered systems and medical materials, etc.

         <title>Electrohydrogenation of Nitriles with Amines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a mild and efficient electrocatalytic method for earth&#8208;abundant cobalt hydride generation through a sequence of cathodic reduction and protonation. The application of this molecular cobalt catalyst allows for electroreductive amination of nitriles to produce various secondary and tertiary amines, as well as deuterium isotope labeling applications from readily available deuterium source.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles represents an efficient and sustainable one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable bulk and fine chemicals. We report herein a molecular cobalt electrocatalyst for selective hydrogenative coupling of nitriles with amines using protons as the hydrogen source. The key to success for this reductive reaction is the use of an electrocatalytic approach for efficient cobalt&#8208;hydride generation through a sequence of cathodic reduction and protonation. As only electrons (e&#8722;) and protons (H+) as the redox equivalent and hydrogen source, this general electrohydrogenation protocol is showcased by highly selective and straightforward synthesis of various functionalized and structurally diverse amines, as well as deuterium isotope labeling applications. Mechanistic studies reveal that the electrogenerated cobalt&#8208;hydride transfer to nitrile process is the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8211;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m-ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m-ZrO2 compared to t-ZrO2. This weak acidity of m-ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m-ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8211;O bond compared to Cu/t-ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sonogenetics for Monitoring and Modulating Biomolecular Function by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasound technology, synergistically harnessed with genetic engineering and chemistry concepts, has started to open the gateway to the remarkable realm of sonogenetics &#8211; a pioneering paradigm for remotely orchestrating cellular functions at the molecular level. This fusion not only enables precisely targeted imaging and therapeutic interventions, but also advances our comprehension of mechanobiology to unparalleled depths. Sonogenetic tools harness mechanical force within small tissue volumes while preserving the integrity of the surrounding physiological environment, reaching depths of up to tens of centimeters with high spatiotemporal precision. These capabilities circumvent the inherent physical limitations of alternative in vivo control methods such as optogenetics and magnetogenetics. In this review, we first discuss mechanosensitive ion channels, the most commonly utilized sonogenetic mediators, in both mammalian and non&#8208;mammalian systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic approaches that leverage thermal or mechanical features of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, we explore strategies centered around the design of mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of ultrasound imaging of biomolecular function, encompassing the utilization of gas vesicles and acoustic reporter genes. Finally, we shed light on limitations and challenges of sonogenetics and present a perspective on the future of this promising technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosing Support&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Effect on Ambient Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation over Nickel/Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The size of support in heterogeneous catalysts can strongly affect the catalytic property but is rarely explored in light&#8208;driven catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the size of TiO2 support governs the selectivity in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation by tuning the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI). Small&#8208;size TiO2 loading nickel (Ni/TiO2&#8208;25) with enhanced MSI promotes photo&#8208;induced electrons of TiO2 migrating to Ni nanoparticles, thus favoring the H2 cleavage and accelerating the CH4 formation (227.7 mmol g&#8201;&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under xenon light&#8208;induced temperature of 360&#8201;&#176;C. Conversely, Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 with large TiO2 prefers yielding CO (94.2 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) due to weak MSI, inefficient charge separation, and inadequate supply of activated hydrogen. Under ambient solar irradiation, Ni/TiO2&#8208;25 achieves the optimized CH4 rate (63.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) with selectivity of 99.8%, while Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 exhibits the CO selectivity of 90.0 % with rate of 30.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. This work offers a novel approach to tailoring light&#8208;driven catalytic properties by support size effect.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8208;H borylation, accessing the fused BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Distortion in the Wadsley&#8208;Roth Niobium Molybdenum Oxide Phase Triggering Extraordinarily Stable Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wadsley&#8208;Roth niobium oxide phases have attracted extensive research interest recently as promising battery anodes. We have synthesized the niobium&#8208;molybdenum oxide shear phase (Nb, Mo)13O33 with superior electrochemical Li&#8208;ion storage performance, including an ultralong cycling lifespan of at least 15000 cycles. During electrochemical cycling, a reversible single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution reaction with lithiated intermediate solid solutions is demonstrated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, with the valence and short&#8208;range structural changes of the electrode probed by in situ Nb and Mo K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. This work reveals that the superior stability of niobium molybdenum oxides is underpinned by changes in octahedral distortion during electrochemical reactions, and we report an in&#8208;depth understanding of how this stabilizes the oxide structure during cycling with implications for future long&#8208;life battery material design.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#160;Engineering Enabling High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Rubost Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Hard Carbon in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP&#8208;HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (~7.4 nm) SEI was constructed on the DP&#8208;HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8%), the as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high ICE of &gt;96.3% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8211;1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP&#8208;HC full&#8208;cell with a 98.7% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP&#8208;HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica&#160;thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70 nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO&#160;conversion efficiency of 98.2% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106 mL g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14 h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15~90%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#183;O2&#8722; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs3Bi2Br9. This work expands an innovative strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts for air pollution remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Microbubble Biointerfacing by Regulation of the Platelet Membrane Surfactant Activity at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface for Acute Thrombosis Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biointerfacing nanomaterials with cell membranes has been successful in the functionalization of nanoparticles or nanovesicles, but microbubble functionalization remains challenging due to the unique conformation of the lipid monolayer structure at the gas&#8208;liquid interface that provides insufficient surfactant activity. Here, we describe a strategy to rationally regulate the surfactant activity of platelet membrane vesicles by adjusting the ratio of proteins to lipids through fusion with synthetic phospholipids (i.e., liposomes). A &#8220;platesome&#8221; with the optimized protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio can be assembled at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in the same manner as pulmonary surfactants to stabilize a microsized gas bubble. Platesome microbubbles (PMBs) inherited 61.4% of the platelet membrane vesicle proteins and maintained the active conformation of integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 without the talin&#8208;1 for fibrin binding. We demonstrated that the PMBs had good stability, long circulation, and superior functionality both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by molecular ultrasound imaging, the PMBs provide up to 11.8 dB of ultrasound signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement for discriminating between acute and chronic thrombi. This surface tension regulating strategy may provide a paradigm for biointerfacing microbubbles with cell membranes, offering a potential new approach for the construction of molecular ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of different diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicoselective Synthesis of Indolohelicenoids via Organocatalytic Central&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Chirality Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a helicoselective and convergent construction of indolohelicenoids with excellent efficiency and stereocontrol. This reaction proceeds through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition and eliminative aromatization sequence, which can be finely controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral phosphoric acid cooperatively serves as both a bifunctional and Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, enabling a one&#8208;pot central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion. Additionally, the optical properties of the synthesized indolohelicenoids were characterized to explore their potential applications in organic photoelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Polar Perovskites for Highly Sensitive&#160;Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray&#160;Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs)  have achieved tremendous success in direct X&#8208;ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport. However, owing to the centrosymmetry of classic 3D structures, these reported X&#8208;ray detectors mostly require external electrical fields to run, resulting in bulky overall circuitry, high energy consumption, and operational instability. Herein, we first report the unprecedented radiation photovoltage in 3D OIHP for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, the 3D polar OIHP MhyPbBr3 (1, Mhy = methylhydrazine) shows an intrinsic radiation photovoltage (0.47 V) and large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (1.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, these excellent physical characteristics endow 1 with sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection performance, showing a considerable sensitivity of 220 &#956;C Gy&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, which surpasses those of most self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detectors. This work first explores highly sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D polar OIHPs, shedding light on future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating the Electrochemical Oxidation of ZnS through Iodide Catalysis for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur (Zn&#8208;S) batteries show great potential for unlocking high energy and safety aqueous batteries. Yet, the sluggish kinetic and poor redox reversibility of the sulfur conversion reaction in aqueous solution challenge the development of Zn&#8208;S batteries. Here, we fabricate a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;S battery using highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 as an effective catalyst. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between I&#8722; and the ZnS nanoparticles (discharge product) leads to the atomic rearrangement of ZnS, weakening the Zn&#8208;S bonding, and thus facilitating the electrochemical oxidation reaction of ZnS to S. The aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery exhibited a high energy density of 742 Wh kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 at the power density of 210.8 W kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn&#8208;S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Patient&#8208;derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids: A Platform for Chemotherapy Evaluation in the Context of T&#8208;cell Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV&#160;compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these,&#160;Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent,&#160;demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Li Deposition by Regulating Structural Connectivity of Electrochemical Li Reservoir in Li&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology&#8208;performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well&#8208;distributed morphology of the in&#8208;situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology-performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well-distributed morphology of the in-situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode-free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bidirectional Regulation of Intracellular Enzyme Activity Using Light&#8208;Driven Nano&#8208;Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical regulation provides precise control over enzyme activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. A promising approach involves anchoring "photoswitches" at enzyme active sites to modulate substrate recognition. However, current methods often require genetic mutations and irreversible enzyme modifications for the site&#8208;specific anchoring of "photoswitches", potentially compromising the enzyme activities. Herein, we present a pioneering reversible nano&#8208;inhibitor based on molecular imprinting technique for bidirectional regulation of intracellular enzyme activity. The nano&#8208;inhibitor employs a molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticle as its body and azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors ("photoswitches") as the arms. By using a target enzyme as the molecular template, the nano&#8208;inhibitor acquires oriented binding sites on its surface, resulting in a high affinity for the target enzyme and non&#8208;covalently firm anchoring of the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitor to the enzyme active site. Harnessing the reversible isomerization of azobenzene units upon exposure to ultraviolet and visible light, the nano&#8208;inhibitor achieves bidirectional enzyme activity regulation by precisely docking and undocking inhibitor at the active site. Notably, this innovative approach enables the facile in situ regulation of intracellular endogenous enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Our results represent a practical and versatile tool for precise enzyme activity regulation in complex intracellular environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Protein Engineering of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase for Light&#8208;Driven Kinetic Resolution of Sec&#8208;Alcohol Oxalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme into stereocomplementary variants for achieving optically pure molecules with tailor&#8208;made (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) using the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both enantiomeric excess up to 99%). These variants were used for the CvFAP&#8208;catalyzed light&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral sec&#8208;alcohols or amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of sec&#8208;alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Harmonizing Enzyme&#8208;like Cofactors to Boost Nanozyme&#160;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering isolated metal sites resembling the primary coordination sphere of metallocofactors enables atomically dispersed materials as promising nanozymes. However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme&#8208;like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like catalysis. Among them, the linker&#8208;coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates. The synergy of three nanocofactors results in a 4.29&#8208;fold enhancement compared with the single effort of isolated metal site&#8208;based nanocofactor, holding promise in immunoassay for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos. This finding opens a new way for designing high&#8208;performance nanozymes by harmonizing various nanocofactors at the atomic and molecular scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;initiated living self&#8208;assembly of polythiophene&#8208;based conjugated block copolymer into erect micellar brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured conjugated polymers are of widespread interest due to their broad applications in organic optoelectronic devices, biomedical sensors and other fields. However, the alignment of conjugated nanostructures perpendicular to&#160;surfaces remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to directly self&#8208;assemble a poly(3&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophene), P3EHT&#8208;based block copolymer into densely aligned micellar brushes through surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The presence of an ethyl pendant on the side group intrinsically moderates the crystallization rate of the polythiophene main chains, and hence favors the controlled living growth of long conjugated fibers and the subsequent fabrication of conjugated micellar brushes. The corona of the micellar brush can be further decorated with platinum nanoparticles by in situ reduction, which enables the formation of erect nanoarrays with heights up to 2700 nm in the dried state. This also renders the micellar brush catalytically active toward hydrogen evolution reaction, which shows a low overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Notably, the P3EHT&#8208;based micellar brush can simultaneously grow with polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PFS&#8208;based micellar brush on the same surface without&#160;significant interference between the two systems. Thus, these two micellar brushes can be patterned through site&#8208;selective immobilization of two types of seeds followed by independent living self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Glutathione Depletion and STING Activation to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Maturation and Cancer Vaccine Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation are key factors for successful vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. This study developed manganese&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (Mn&#8208;LDH) nanoparticles as a self&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine carrier that not only promoted DC maturation through synergistically depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) and activating STING signaling pathway, but also facilitated the delivery of model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into lymph nodes and subsequent antigen presentation in DCs. Significant therapeutic&#8208;prophylactic efficacy of the OVA&#8208;loaded Mn&#8208;LDH (OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH) nanovaccine was determined by the tumor growth inhibition in the mice bearing B16&#8208;OVA tumor. Our results showed that the OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH nanoparticles could be a potent delivery system for cancer vaccine development without the need of adjuvant. Therefore, the combination of GSH exhaustion and STING pathway activation might be an advisable approach for promoting DC maturation and antigen presentation, finally improving cancer vaccine efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of a Hydrophobic Protrusion on Nanoparticles to Improve the Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Ability and Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction to achieve easy and fast membrane anchoring and cellular internalization is of great importance in a variety of biomedical applications. Here we report a simple and versatile strategy to maneuver the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction by creating a tunable hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles through swelling&#8208;induced symmetry breaking. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, leading the particles to docking to the membrane, followed by drawing the whole particles into the cell. The efficiencies of both membrane anchoring and cellular internalization can be promoted by optimizing the size of the protrusion. In vitro, the Janus particles can quickly anchor to the cell membrane in 1 h and be internalized within 24 h, regardless of the types of cells involved. In vivo, the Janus particles can effectively anchor to the brain and skin tissues to provide a high retention in these tissues after intracerebroventricular, intrahippocampal, or subcutaneous injection. This strategy involving the creation of a hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles to tune the cell&#8208;membrane interaction holds great potential in nanoparticle&#8208;based biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 Signaling and Inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; Checkpoint with a Dual siRNA&#8208;Assembled Nanoadjuvant for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the anti&#8208;tumor immunity as they are responsible for capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells. However, their activation is often limited by the absence of adjuvants and the suppressive effects of immune checkpoints, such as CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945;. Herein, we present a nanoadjuvant that is self&#8208;assembled from long RNA building blocks generated through rolling circle transcription (RCT) reaction and further modified with cationic liposomes. Owing to the high load of densely packed RNA, this nanoadjuvant could robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling in APCs, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti&#8208;tumor M1&#8208;like phenotype. In addition, with a well&#8208;designed template, the generated long RNA from RCT reaction includes two kinds of siRNA targeting both CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs. This dual gene silencing results in efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint. Collectively, the robust activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling and efficient inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint enhance the phagocytic activity of APCs, which in turn promotes the cross&#8208;priming of effector T cells and the activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. This study therefore provides a simple and robust RNA nanoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>L&#8208;Glycosidase&#8208;Cleavable Natural Glycans Facilitate the Chemical Synthesis of Correctly Folded Disulfide&#8208;Bonded D&#8208;Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;peptide ligands can be screened for therapeutic potency and enzymatic stability using synthetic mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins), but efficient acquisition of these D&#8208;proteins can be hampered by the need to accomplish their in vitro folding, which often requires the formation of correctly linked disulfide bonds. Here, we report the finding that temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto selected D&#8208;serine or D&#8208;threonine residues of the synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and that the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins to afford the desired chirally inverted D&#8208;protein targets using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase. This approach enabled the efficient chemical syntheses of several important but difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold D&#8208;proteins incorporating disulfide bonds including the mirror&#8208;image tumor necrosis factor alpha (D&#8208;TNF&#945;) homotrimer and the mirror&#8208;image receptor&#8208;binding domain of the Omicron spike protein (D&#8208;RBD). Our work establishes the use of O&#8208;GlcNAc to facilitate D&#8208;protein synthesis and folding and proves that D&#8208;proteins bearing O&#8208;GlcNAc can be good substrates for naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Control and Singlet Energy Transfer Enabled by Trimethylamine Modified Boron Dipyrromethene for Stable CsPbBr3 Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phase distribution and organic spacer cations play pivotal roles in determining the emission performance and stability of perovskite quantum wells (QWs). Here, we propose a universal molecular regulation strategy to tailor phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 QWs. The capability of sterically hindered ligands with formidable surface binding groups is underscored in directing CsPbBr3 growth and refining phase distribution. With trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) ligand as a representative, the BDP&#8208;TMA driven can precisely control phase distribution and passivate defects of CsPbBr3. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA acts as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity in obtained BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3, facilitating efficient singlet energy transfer and tailoring the luminescence to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. The BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 demonstrates significant phase stability under water exposure, light irradiation, and moderate temperature. Interestingly, BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control at elevated temperatures, which can be achieved feasible for advanced information encryption. This discovery paves the way for the exploration of perovskite QWs in applications like temperature sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other advanced optical smart technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Multiple Photosensitizer Modules into One Supramolecular System for Synergetic Enhancement of Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an emerging cancer treatment requires the development of highly desirable photosensitizers (PSs) with integrated functional groups to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) would provide an alternative approach for combining multiple PSs synergistically. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful strategy of combining conventional chromophores (tetraphenylethylene, porphyrin, or Zn&#8208;porphyrin) with pyridinium salts PSs together via condensation reactions, followed by CDSA to construct a series of novel metallo&#8208;supramolecular&#160;PSs (S1&#8211;S3). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is dramatically enhanced via the direct combination of two different PSs, and further reinforced in the cases of the subsequent ensembles. Among all the ensembles, S2 with porphyrin core shows the highest ROS generation efficiency, specific interaction towards lysosome, and strong emission for probing cells. Moreover, the cellular and living experiments confirm that S2 owns excellent PDT efficacy, biocompatibility, and biosafety. As such, this work will shed light on the advancement of more efficient PSs with potential clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing uniform covalent organic framework (COF) film on substrates for electronic devices is highly desirable. Here, a simple and mild strategy is developed to prepare them by polymerization on a solid&#8208;liquid interface. The universality of the method is confirmed by the successful preparation of five COF films with different microstructures. These films have large lateral size, controllable thickness, and high crystalline quality. And COF patterns can also be directly achieved on substrates via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interface engineering, which is in favor of preparing device array. For application studies, the PyTTA&#8208;TPA (PyTTA: 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8244;&#8208;(1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene and TPA: terephthalaldehyde) COF film has a high photoresponsivity of 59.79 &#956;A W&#8211;1 at 420 nm for photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection. When employed as an active material for optoelectronic synaptic devices for the first attempt, it shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties such as short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), and the conversion of STP to LTP, which can be used to simulate biological synaptic functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Assembly of Highly Oxidized Cobalt on Graphdiyne Surface for Efficient Conversion of Nitrogen into Nitric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO3) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO3 from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp&#8208;C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5%) were achieved at low potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Dinitroxide Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization to Enhance Overall NMR Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR at 9.4 T and 100 K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build&#8208;up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. NaphPol and HydroPol are found to provide the best overall sensitivity factors, in organic and aqueous solvents respectively. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, provides good sensitivity for all three solvent formulations measured here, and can be considered to be a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarization agent.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Determination of the Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground State of Tridecacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open&#8208;shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on&#8208;surface synthesis of tridecacene molecule by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of the inelastic signal at 126 meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to the spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carry out many&#8208;body ab&#8208;initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonian to take into account the effect of metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamical electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap. Therefore, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.</dc:description>

         <title>NeuM: A Neuron&#8208;Selective Probe Incorporates into Live Neuronal Membranes via Enhanced Clathrin&#8208;Mediated Endocytosis in Primary Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we introduce NeuM, a fluorescent probe for the selective labeling of live&#8208;neuronal membranes. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM self&#8208;assembles into micelles, which are selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes and integrated into the neuronal membrane through the endocytic recycling pathway. MD simulations demonstrated that NeuM has optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers.







Abstract
The development of a small&#8208;molecule probe designed to selectively target neurons would enhance the exploration of intricate neuronal structures and functions. Among such probes, NeuO stands out as the pioneer and has gained significant traction in the field of research. Nevertheless, neither the mechanism behind neuron&#8208;selectivity nor the cellular localization has been determined. Here, we introduce NeuM, a derivative of NeuO, designed to target neuronal cell membranes. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism behind the selective neuronal membrane trafficking that distinguishes neurons. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM autonomously assembles into micellar structures, leading to the quenching of its fluorescence (&#934;=0.001). Upon exposure to neurons, NeuM micelles were selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes via clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Through the endocytic recycling pathway, NeuM micelles integrate into neuronal membrane, dispersing fluorescent NeuM molecules in the membrane (&#934;=0.61). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that NeuM, in comparison to NeuO, possesses optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers. The stable integration of NeuM within neuronal membrane allows the prolonged monitoring of neurons, as well as the visualization of intricate neuronal structures.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Fluoroethylene Carbonate on the Stability of Sb||Graphite Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries in Propylene Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the addition of FEC, a robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase formed on the surface of Sb anode and graphite cathode, inhibiting the pulverization of Sb and the expansion of graphite. The formation of FEC&#8208;rich anions solvation structure facilitates the insertion of PF6&#8722;, which significantly improves the reversible capacity. Thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced performance of high voltage and power density Sb||graphite dual&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have attracted increasing attention due to their high operative voltages and low&#8208;cost raw materials. However, the practical applications of Na&#8208;DIBs are still hindered by the issues, such as low capacity and poor Coulombic efficiency, which is highly correlated with the compatibility between electrode and electrolyte but rarely investigated. Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into the electrolyte to regulate cation/anion solvation structure and the stability of cathode/anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase of Na&#8208;DIBs. The FEC modulates the environment of PF6&#8722; solvation sheath and facilitates the interaction of PF6&#8722; on graphite. In addition, the NaF&#8208;rich interphase caused by the preferential decomposition of FEC effectively inhibits side reactions and pulverization of anodes with the electrolyte. Consequently, Sb||graphite full cells in FEC&#8208;containing electrolyte achieve an improved capacity, cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency. This work elucidates the underlying mechanism of bifunctional FEC and provides an alternative strategy of building high&#8208;performance dual ion batteries.

Ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered Pd nanoclusters are synthesized and precisely characterized. Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208; ring coordination is reported, which contributes to the exceptional stability of the as&#8208;obtained nanocluster, as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, the horizontal electron transition induces superb photothermal conversion efficiency of 73.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Constructing ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials with atomic precision and understanding their underlying stability mechanisms are challenging. Here, stable single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanoclusters of Pd were synthesized and precisely characterized through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. A pseudo&#8208;pentalene&#8208;like Pd8 unit was found in the nanocluster, interacting with two syn PPh units through nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination. The unexpected coordination, which is distinctly different from the typical organoring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination in half&#8208;sandwich&#8208;type organometallic compounds, contributes to the ambient stability of the as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanocluster as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations revealed dominant electron transition along the horizontal x&#8208;direction of the Pd8 plane, indicating high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the nanocluster, which was verified by the experimental PCE of 73.3&#8201;%. Therefore, this study unveils the birth of a novel type of compound and the finding of the unusual nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination and has important implications for future syntheses, structures, properties, and structure&#8211;property correlations of single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A General Synthesis of Nanostructured Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks from Insulating MOF Precursors for Supercapacitors and Chemiresistive Sensors</title>

A template strategy has been developed for the general synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with high crystallinity, tailored morphologies, and high porosity via insulating MOFs&#8208;to&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs transformations. These nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs show great potential in supercapacitors and chemiresistive H2S sensors.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique subclass of layer&#8208;stacked crystalline coordination polymers that simultaneously possess porous and conductive properties, and have broad application potential in energy and electronic devices. However, to make the best use of the intrinsic electronic properties and structural features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, the controlled synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs with high crystallinity and customized morphologies is essential, which remains a great challenge. Herein, we present a template strategy to synthesize a library of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with controlled morphologies and dimensions via insulating MOFs&#8208;to&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs transformations. The resultant hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature intrinsic electrical conductivity and higher surface areas than the reported bulk&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;MOFs, which are beneficial for improved access to active sites and enhanced mass transport. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications, the hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs exhibit a superior performance for electrical properties related applications (hollow Cu&#8208;BHT nanocubes&#8208;based supercapacitor and Cu&#8208;HHB nanoflowers&#8208;based chemiresistive gas sensor), achieving over 225&#8201;% and 250&#8201;% improvement in specific capacity and response intensity over the corresponding bulk type c&#8208;MOFs, respectively.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptor Featuring Unique Self&#8208;Regulation Effect for Organic Solar Cells with 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;regulation effect is well demonstrated by finely tuning the aggregation behavior of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) Z9, where the tethered phenyl groups worked as endogenous additives and participated in intermolecular packing enabling the formation of 3D charge transport channels with super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. NFA Z9 forms optimal nanomorphology with polymer donors without external additives, and a high PCE of 19.0&#8201;% is achieved.







Abstract
The blend nanomorphology of electron&#8208;donor (D) and &#8208;acceptor (A) materials is of vital importance to achieving highly efficient organic solar cells. Exogenous additives especially aromatic additives are always needed to further optimize the nanomorphology of blend films, which is hardly compatible with industrial manufacture. Herein, we proposed a unique approach to meticulously modulate the aggregation behavior of NFAs in both crystal and thin film nanomorphology via self&#8208;regulation effect. Nonfullerene acceptor Z9 was designed and synthesized by tethering phenyl groups on the inner side chains of the Y6 backbone. Compared with Y6, the tethered phenyl groups participated in the molecular aggregation via the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl&#8208;phenyl and phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC&#8208;2F) groups, which induced 3D charge transport with phenyl&#8208;mediated super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. Moreover, ordered molecular packing with suitable phase separation was observed in Z9&#8208;based blend films. High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.0&#8201;% (certified PCE of 18.6&#8201;%) for Z9&#8208;based devices were achieved without additives, indicating the great potential of the self&#8208;regulation strategy in NFA design.

         <title>Measurement of Accumulation of Antibiotics to Staphylococcus aureus in Phagosomes of Live Macrophages
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staphylococcus aureus can persist within host immune cells, potentially evading immune responses and antibiotics. Investigating antibiotic permeability into phagocytic vacuoles, we developed a permeability assay. By analyzing antibiotic arrival in phagosomes of infected macrophages, we identified permeability differences, offering insights into antibiotic contribution to intracellular pathogens.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) has evolved the ability to persist after uptake into host immune cells. This intracellular niche enables S.&#8197;aureus to potentially escape host immune responses and survive the lethal actions of antibiotics. While the elevated tolerance of S.&#8197;aureus to small&#8208;molecule antibiotics is likely to be multifactorial, we pose that there may be contributions related to permeation of antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles, which would require translocation across two mammalian bilayers. To empirically test this, we adapted our recently developed permeability assay to determine the accumulation of FDA&#8208;approved antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles of live macrophages. Bioorthogonal reactive handles were metabolically anchored within the surface of S.&#8197;aureus, and complementary tags were chemically added to antibiotics. Following phagocytosis of tagged S.&#8197;aureus cells, we were able to specifically analyze the arrival of antibiotics within the phagosomes of infected macrophages. Our findings enabled the determination of permeability differences between extra&#8208; and intracellular S.&#8197;aureus, thus providing a roadmap to dissect the contribution of antibiotic permeability to intracellular pathogens.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Micro&#8208;Hydrophobic Effect Regulates Benzene Methylation in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 were identified by using solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations. The micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects induced by the local water molecules in ZSM&#8208;5 channels can drive the benzene molecules towards to surface methoxy species (SMS) to form the active SMS&#8208;Benzene complex, which promotes benzene methylation.







Abstract
Water is a ubiquitous component in heterogeneous catalysis over zeolites and can significantly influence the catalyst performance. However, the detailed mechanism insights into zeolite&#8208;catalyzed reactions under microscale aqueous environment remain elusive. Here, using multiple dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations, we establish a fundamental understanding of the role of water in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite under water vapor conditions. We show that water competes with benzene for the active sites of zeolite and facilitates the bimolecular reaction mechanism. The growth of water clusters induces a micro&#8208;hydrophobic effect in zeolite pores, which reorients benzene molecules and drives their interactions with surface methoxy species (SMS) on zeolite. We identify the formation and evolution of active SMS&#8208;Benzene complexes in a microscale aqueous environment and demonstrate that their accumulation in zeolite pores boosts benzene conversion and methylation.

         <title>Structure of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP Bound to the Covalent Active&#8208;Site Inhibitor Cystargolide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two clpP genes next to the biosynthetic genes for the cystargolides in Kitasatospora cystarginea provided the impetus to test the natural products for anti&#8208;ClpP activity. Cystargolides emerged as covalent ClpP inhibitors and are the first &#946;&#8208;lactones for which ClpP co&#8208;crystal structures could be solved. The molecular inhibition mechanism is presented.







Abstract
The caseinolytic protease is a highly conserved serine protease, crucial to prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and a promising antibacterial and anticancer drug target. Herein, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural &#946;&#8208;lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP. Based on the discovery of two clpP genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in Kitasatospora cystarginea, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods in vitro. Synthesis of semisynthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in S. aureus cells and to demonstrate the anti&#8208;virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from S. aureus, Aquifex aeolicus, and Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by &#946;&#8208;lactones, the predominant class of ClpP inhibitors.

&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;i&gt;clpP&lt;/i&gt; genes next to the biosynthetic genes for the cystargolides in &lt;i&gt;Kitasatospora cystarginea&lt;/i&gt; provided the impetus to test the natural products for anti-ClpP activity. Cystargolides emerged as covalent ClpP inhibitors and are the first &#946;-lactones for which ClpP co-crystal structures could be solved. The molecular inhibition mechanism is presented.

         <title>Relationships Between Defectivity and Porosity in High Surface Area Porous Aromatic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their high apparent surface areas and robust chemical stability, porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are being investigated to address a variety of technological challenges where material stability and porosity govern performance. A challenge complicating the synthesis of these materials is the strong dependence of their porosity on synthetic pathway. In this paper, we show that porosity is dependent on defectivity and that defectivity varies significantly between synthetic approaches..







Abstract
Porous aromatic framework (PAF) microporosity is known to be strongly dependent on synthetic approach but little is known about why certain reactions yield significantly and consistently more porous PAFs. This article explores the connections between synthetic pathway, PAF defectivity, and microporosity. Using a network disassembly strategy, we show that defectivity is highly dependent on synthetic approach and that more defective PAFs are associated with lower surface areas and pore volumes. This empirical association is corroborated through systematic introduction of defects to a modelPAF, which results in significant reduction of apparent surface area and pore volumes. Taken together, these data suggest that only highly efficient coupling reactions should be targeted for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high surface area porous aromatic frameworks.

         <title>Boosting H+ Storage in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries via Integrating Redox&#8208;Active Sites into Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking</title>

We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active hydrogen bonding organic framework with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interacting assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene as the cathode material for boosting H+ storage in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage.







Abstract
In the emerging aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), proton (H+) with the smallest molar mass and fast (de)coordination kinetics is considered as the most ideal charge carrier compared with Zn2+ counterpart, however, searching for new hosting materials for H+ storage is still at its infancy. Herein, redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene (HOF&#8208;HATN) are for the first time developed as the stable cathode hosting material for boosting H+ storage in AZIBs. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage. As a consequence, HOF&#8208;HATN displays a high capacity (320&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and robust cyclability of (&gt;10000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) based on three&#8208;step cation coordination storage. These findings get insight into the proton transport and storage behavior in HOFs and provide the molecular engineering strategy for constructing well&#8208;defined cathode hosting materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Photoexcitation of Distinct Divalent Palladium Complexes in Cross&#8208;Coupling Amination Under Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium photocatalytic method is reported for the successful synthesis of primary anilines by the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides and sodium azide under open&#8208;air conditions at room temperature. For the first time, diverse divalent palladium complexes are shown to undergo photoexcitation to give carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) cross&#8208;coupled product under air without using sophisticated ligands.







Abstract
The development of metal complexes that function as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst remains a challenging research topic. So far, progress has been shown in palladium(0) excited&#8208;state transition metal catalysis for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds where the oxidative addition of alkyl/aryl halides to zero&#8208;valent palladium (Pd0) is achievable at room temperature. In contrast, the analogous process with divalent palladium (PdII) is uphill and endothermic. For the first time, we report that divalent palladium can act as a light&#8208;absorbing species that undergoes double excitation to realize carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) cross&#8208;couplings under air. Differently substituted aryl halides can be applied in the mild, and selective cross&#8208;coupling amination using palladium acetate as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst at room temperature. Density functional theory studies supported by mechanistic investigations provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Three in One: Three Different Molybdates Trapped in a Thiacalix[4]arene Protected Ag72 Nanocluster for Structural Transformation and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different molybdates were trapped simultaneously in a thiacalix[4]arene&#8208;protected Ag72 nanocluster (Ag72b). The reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc resulted in the formation of a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a), whereas reaction with PhCOOAg gave a Ag28 nanocluster&#8208;based 1D chain structure (Ag28a). Photothermal conversion performance demonstrated that the Ag28a is superior to the Ag72b.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent crucial intermediates in the formation of insoluble metal oxides from soluble metal ions, however, the rapid hydrolysis&#8208;condensation kinetics of MoVI or WVI makes the direct characterization of coexisted molecular species in a given medium extremely difficult. Silver nanoclusters have shown versatile capacity to encapsulate diverse POMs, which provides an alternative scene to appreciate landscape of POMs in atomic precision. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanocluster (Ag72b) that simultaneously encapsulates three kinds of molybdates (MoO42&#8722;, Mo6O228&#8722; and Mo7O258&#8722;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo6O192&#8722;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. Ag72b is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster. The post&#8208;reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc or PhCOOAg produces a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a) or an Ag28 nanocluster based 1D chain structure (Ag28a), respectively. Moreover, the post&#8208;synthesized Ag28a can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom&#8208;precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.

&lt;sup&gt;8&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;8&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. &lt;b&gt;Ag72b&lt;/b&gt; is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster. The post-reaction of &lt;b&gt;Ag72b&lt;/b&gt; with AgOAc or PhCOOAg produces a discrete Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster (&lt;b&gt;Ag24a&lt;/b&gt;) or an Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster based 1D chain structure (&lt;b&gt;Ag28a&lt;/b&gt;), respectively. Moreover, the post-synthesized &lt;b&gt;Ag28a&lt;/b&gt; can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom-precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective Inhibition of TDP&#8208;43 Aggregation by Native State Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is an essential co&#8208;pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we developed two strategies to stabilize the native&#8208;state TDP&#8208;43 against its aggregation, namely by phosphomimetic substitutions in the C&#8208;terminus, and by small&#8208;molecule modulation. Our results represent the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on functional TDP&#8208;43 targeting and related drug discovery.







Abstract
Preventing the misfolding or aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is the most actively pursued disease&#8208;modifying strategy to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we provide proof of concept that native state stabilization of TDP&#8208;43 is a viable and effective strategy for treating TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies. Firstly, we leveraged the Cryo&#8208;EM structures of TDP&#8208;43 fibrils to design C&#8208;terminal substitutions that disrupt TDP&#8208;43 aggregation. Secondly, we showed that these substitutions (S333D/S342D) stabilize monomeric TDP&#8208;43 without altering its physiological properties. Thirdly, we demonstrated that binding native oligonucleotide ligands stabilized monomeric TDP&#8208;43 and prevented its fibrillization and phase separation in the absence of direct binding to the aggregation&#8208;prone C&#8208;terminal domain. Fourthly, we showed that the monomeric TDP&#8208;43 variant could be induced to aggregate in a controlled manner, which enabled the design and implementation of a high&#8208;throughput screening assay to identify native state stabilizers of TDP&#8208;43. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that different structural domains in TDP&#8208;43 could be exploited and targeted to develop drugs that stabilize the native state of TDP&#8208;43 and provide a platform to discover novel drugs to treat TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies.

         <title>Structural Basis of the Bivalency of the TRPV1 Agonist DkTx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using protein&#8208;splicing, we produced a labelled bivalent capsaicin receptor agonist, DkTx, for NMR characterisation. The structure reveals linker pre&#8208;organisation stabilised by interaction between the first domain and the linker. Disrupting this reduces linker order, affecting avidity at sub&#8208;saturating concentrations, illustrating how linker order enhances potency of bivalent receptor engagement.







Abstract
Bivalency is a prevalent natural mechanism to enhance receptor avidity. Various two&#8208;domain disulfide&#8208;rich peptides exhibiting bivalent action have been identified from animal venoms. A unique characteristic of these peptides is that they induce a pharmacological response different from that provoked by any of the constituent domains. The enhanced potency and avidity of such peptides is therefore a consequence of their domain fusion by a peptide linker. The role of the linker itself, beyond conjugation, remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the linker affects the bivalency of the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) agonist DkTx. We recombinantly produced isotope labelled DkTx using a protein splicing approach, to solve the high&#8208;resolution solution structure of DkTx, revealing residual linker order stabilised by linker&#8208;domain interactions leading to biased domain orientations. The significance of this was studied using a combination of mutagenesis, spin relaxation studies and electrophysiology measurements. Our results reveal that disrupting the pre&#8208;organisation of the domains of DkTx is accompanied by reductions in potency and onset of avidity. Our findings support a model of pre&#8208;configured two&#8208;domain binding, in favour of the previously suggested sequential binding model. This highlights the significance of ordered elements in linker design and the natural evolution of these in bivalent toxins.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalently Stapled H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels Activatable by Visible Light for Targeted Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully constructed the first example of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by 442&#8197;nm visible light, enabling the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8722; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10&#8197;min, 90&#8201;% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells.







Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels, capable of specifically disturbing the intracellular ion homeostasis of cancer cells, presents an intriguing opportunity for achieving high selectivity in cancer therapy. Herein, we describe a novel family of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by biocompatible visible light at 442&#8197;nm, which enables the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8722; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10&#8197;min, 90&#8201;% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells (IC50=8.5&#8197;&#956;M). The mechanism underlying cancer cell death mediated by the H+/Cl&#8722; channels involves the activation of the caspase&#8197;9 apoptosis pathway as well as the scarcely reported disruption of the autophagic processes. In the absence of photoirradiation, C4F&#8208;L exhibits minimal toxicity towards normal intestine cells, even at a concentration of 200&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Drives the Electrochemical Oxidation of Silane to Silanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a Mn single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) stabilized on N&#8208;doped carbon via thermal decomposition of a ZIF (Mn&#8208;SA@NC). By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn&#8208;SA@NC drives the electrochemical oxidation of silane to silanol. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), characterized by a four&#8208;electron transfer kinetic process, represents a significant bottleneck in improving the efficiency of hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Consequently, extensive research efforts have been directed towards identifying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with exceptional OER performance. Despite the comprehensive understanding of the OER mechanism, its application to other valuable synthetic reactions has been limited. Herein, we leverage the MOOH intermediate, a key species in the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst (Mn&#8208;SA@NC), which can be cyclically delivered in the OER. We exploit this intermediate&#8217; s capability to facilitate electrophilic transfer with silane, enabling efficient silane oxidation under electrochemical conditions. The SAC electrocatalytic system exhibits remarkable performance with catalyst loadings as low as 600&#8197;ppm and an exceptional turnover number of 9132. Furthermore, the catalytic method demonstrates stability under a 10&#8197;mmol flow chemistry setup. By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn&#8208;SA@NC drives the entire reaction, establishing a practical Mn SAC&#8208;catalyzed organic electrosynthesis system. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.

The SAC electrocatalytic system exhibits remarkable performance with catalyst loadings as low as 600&#8197;ppm and an exceptional turnover number of 9132. Furthermore, the catalytic method demonstrates stability under a 10&#8197;mmol flow chemistry setup. By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn-SA@NC drives the entire reaction, establishing a practical Mn SAC-catalyzed organic electrosynthesis system. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Living Materials Based Dynamic Information Encryption via Light&#8208;Inducible Bacterial Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli/eLightOn&#8208;smCSE) that biosynthesize CdS quantum dots (QDs) in response to light can be utilized for dynamic information encryption. By harnessing the advantage of living materials, this approach introduces three layers of security: the information remains invisible under natural light, becomes readable only with specific substrates, and auto&#8208;deletes after access.







Abstract
Microbial biosynthesis, as an alternative method for producing quantum dots (QDs), has gained attention because it can be conducted under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, distinguishing it from conventional chemical and physical synthesis approaches. However, there is currently no method to selectively control this biosynthesis process in a subset of microbes within a population using external stimuli. In this study, we have attained precise and selective control over the microbial biosynthesis of QDs through the utilization of an optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli). The recombinant E. coli is designed to express smCSE enzyme, under the regulation of eLightOn system, which can be activated by blue light. The smCSE enzymes use L&#8208;cysteine and Cd2+ as substrates to form CdS QDs. This system enables light&#8208;inducible bacterial biosynthesis of QDs in precise patterns within a hydrogel for information encryption. As the biosynthesis progresses, the optical characteristics of the QDs change, allowing living materials containing the recombinant E. coli to display time&#8208;dependent patterns that self&#8208;destruct after reading. Compared to static encryption using fluorescent QD inks, dynamic information encryption based on living materials offers enhanced security.

         <title>Tailored Fluorosurfactants through Controlled/Living Radical Polymerization for Highly Stable Microfluidic Droplet Generation</title>

Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics reimagined using LRP&#8208;synthesized fluorosurfactants. Improved stability, biocompatibility, and promising applications.







Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics represents a disruptive technology in the field of chemistry and biology through the generation and manipulation of sub&#8208;microlitre droplets. To avoid droplet coalescence, fluoropolymer&#8208;based surfactants are commonly used to reduce the interfacial tension between two immiscible phases to stabilize droplet interfaces. However, the conventional preparation of fluorosurfactants involves multiple steps of conjugation reactions between fluorinated and hydrophilic segments to form multiple&#8208;block copolymers. In addition, synthesis of customized surfactants with tailored properties is challenging due to the complex synthesis process. Here, we report a highly efficient synthetic method that utilizes living radical polymerization (LRP) to produce fluorosurfactants with tailored functionalities. Compared to the commercialized surfactant, our surfactants outperform in thermal cycling for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and exhibit exceptional biocompatibility for cell and yeast culturing in a double&#8208;emulsion system. This breakthrough synthetic approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics by enabling the development of novel designs that generate droplets with superior stability and functionality for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Fast Interfacial Carrier Dynamics Modulated by Bidirectional Charge Transport Channels in ZnIn2S4&#8208;based Composite Photoanodes Probed by Scanning Photoelectrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy that can synchronously modulate the simultaneous migration of electrons and holes in different directions on the photoanode to improve PEC performance was reported. This work can deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation and provide valuable guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrode materials.







Abstract
Limited charge separation/transport efficiency remains the primary obstacle of achieving satisfying photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. Therefore, it is essential to develop diverse interfacial engineering strategies to mitigate charge recombination. Despite obvious progress having been made, most works only considered a single&#8208;side modulation in either the electrons of conduction band or the holes of valence band in a semiconductor photoanode, leading to a limited PEC performance enhancement. Beyond this conventional thinking, we developed a novel coupling modification strategy to achieve a composite electrode with bidirectional carrier transport for a better charge separation, in which Ti2C3Tx MXene quantum dots (MQDs) and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots (FO) are anchored on the surface of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanoplates, resulting in markedly improved PEC water splitting of pure ZIS photoanode. Systematic studies indicated that the bidirectional charge transfer pathways were stimulated due to MQDs as &#8220;electron extractor&#8221; and S&#8722;O bonds as carriers transport channels, which synergistically favors significantly enhanced charge separation. The enhanced kinetic behavior at the FO/MQDs/ZIS interfaces was systematically and quantitatively evaluated by a series of methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation, and provide valuable guidance for the rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrodes.

         <title>Crystal Growth Regulation of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites via Self&#8208;Assembly of Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We incorporated robust quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions to regulate the crystal growth of 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites. This was achieved through the development of two unique semiconductor spacers, namely PTMA and 5FPTMA, with different dipole moments. Devices utilizing films incorporating these interactions exhibited a significant efficiency enhancement, increasing from 15.66&#8201;% to 18.56&#8201;%.







Abstract
The crystal growth and orientation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite films significantly impact solar cell performance. Here, we incorporated robust quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions to govern the crystal growth of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites. This was achieved through the development of two unique semiconductor spacers, namely PTMA and 5FPTMA, with different dipole moments. The ((5FPTMA)0.1(PTMA)0.9)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, 5F/PTMA&#8722;Pb) film shows a preferred vertical orientation, reduced grain boundaries, and released residual strain compared to (PTMA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, PTMA&#8722;Pb), resulting in a decreased exciton binding energy and reduced electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficients. In contrast to PTMA&#8722;Pb device with an efficiency of 15.66&#8201;%, the 5F/PTMA&#8722;Pb device achieved a champion efficiency of 18.56&#8201;%, making it among the best efficiency for 2D RP perovskite solar cells employing an MA&#8208;based semiconductor spacer. This work offers significant insights into comprehending the crystal growth process of 2D RP perovskite films through the utilization of quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions between semiconductor spacers.

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new condensation system was developed for integrating helicene &#960; units into 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D helicene materials via C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The 2D helicene frameworks are chemically robust, enable extended &#960; conjugation over 2D planes, create low band gap, exhibit exceptional photoconductivity, and achieve benchmark efficient red emission, opening a way to novel &#960; electronic materials.







Abstract
Helicenes are a class of fascinating chiral helical molecules with rich chemistry developed continuously over the past 100&#8197;years. Their helical, conjugated, and twisted structures make them attractive for constructing molecular systems. However, studies over the past century are mainly focused on synthesizing helicenes with increased numbers of aromatic rings and complex heterostructures, while research on inorganic, organic, and polymeric helicene materials is still embryonic. Herein, we report the first examples of helicene covalent organic frameworks, i.e., [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1, by condensing [7]Helicene dialdehyde with trimethyl triazine via the C=C bond formation reaction under solvothermal conditions. The resultant [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits prominent X&#8208;ray diffraction peaks and assumes a highly ordered 2D lattice structure originated from the twisted configuration of [7]Helicene unit. The C=C linked [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 materials exhibited extended &#960; conjugation and broadly tuned their absorption, emission, redox activity, photoconductivity, and light&#8208;emitting activity, demonstrating rich multifunctionalities and great potentials in developing various applications. This work opens a way to a new family of COFs as well as helicene materials, enabling the exploration of unprecedented &#960; architectures and properties.

         <title>Controlled cluster expansion at a Zintl cluster surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise growth of eleven&#8208; and twelve&#8208;vertex multimetallic clusters from a ten&#8208;atom precursor is demonstrated. These rare examples of closo&#8208; to closo&#8208; cluster expansion reactions offer insight into the mechanisms by which Zintl clusters assemble in solution. The resultant clusters possess exo&#8208;bonds to chlorine atoms that may allow for post&#8208;synthetic functionalization and their incorporation into materials.







Abstract
Reaction of the tris&#8208;hypersilyl nonagermanide Zintl cluster salt, K[Ge9(Hyp)3] (Hyp=Si(SiMe3)3) with [Rh(&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;L)Cl]2 (L=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, COD; norbornadiene, NBD) afforded eleven&#8208; and twelve&#8208;vertex homo&#8208;multimetallic clusters by cluster core expansion. Using a stepwise procedure, starting from the Zintl cluster [Rh(COD){Ge9(Hyp)3}] and [Ir(COD)Cl]2, this methodology was expanded for the synthesis of eleven&#8208;vertex hetero&#8208;multimetallic clusters. A mechanism for the formation of these first examples of closo eleven&#8208;vertex Zintl clusters is proposed, informed by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Integrating Host Design and Tailored Electronic Effects of Yolk&#8211;Shell Zn&#8722;Mn Diatomic Sites for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly accessible yolk&#8211;shell structure and tailored electronic effects of the dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalyst (DASC) Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC endow it with excellent performance in the conversion of CO2 into CO in both an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell. Robust interactions with the Zn&#8722;Mn dual site, which shows an ideal adsorption strength for COOH*, effectively decrease the energy barrier of the reaction, thereby enhancing the inherent activity of CO2 reduction on the DASC.







Abstract
Modulating the surface and spatial structure of the host is associated with the reactivity of the active site, and also enhances the mass transfer effect of the CO2 electroreduction process (CO2RR). Herein, we describe the development of two&#8208;step ligand etch&#8211;pyrolysis to access an asymmetric dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalyst (DASC) composed of a yolk&#8211;shell carbon framework (Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC) derived from S,N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8722;Mn dimers anchored on a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC, the electronic effects of the S/N&#8722;Zn&#8722;Mn&#8722;S/N configuration are tailored by strong interactions between Zn&#8722;Mn dual sites and co&#8208;coordination with S/N atoms, rendering structural stability and atomic distribution. In an H&#8208;cell, the Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC DASC shows a low onset overpotential of 50&#8197;mV and high CO Faraday efficiency of 97&#8201;% with a low applied overpotential of 343&#8197;mV, thus outperforming counterparts, and in a flow cell, it also reaches a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V, benefitting from the high structure accessibility and active dual sites. DFT simulations showed that the S,N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8722;Mn diatomic site with optimal adsorption strength of COOH* lowers the reaction energy barrier, thus boosting the intrinsic CO2RR activity on DASC. The structure&#8208;property correlation found in this study suggests new ideas for the development of highly accessible atomic catalysts.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells: The Important Role of Seed Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs butylamine&#8208;capped CsPbI3 nanocrystals as additives of FAPbI3 film for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Well&#8208;defined CsPbI3 nanocrystals can not only manipulate the nucleation and growth of perovskite films but also release lattice strain to minimize defect concentrations. As a result, perovskite solar cells achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.41&#8201;%.







Abstract
Additive engineering has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Among additives, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have a similar chemical composition and matched lattice structure with the perovskite matrix, which can effectively enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, relevant studies remain limited, and most of them focus on bromide&#8208;involved perovskite NCs, which may undergo dissolution and ion exchange within the FAPbI3 host, potentially resulting in an enlarged band gap. In this work, we employ butylamine&#8208;capped CsPbI3 NCs (BPNCs) as additives in PSCs, which can be well maintained and serve as seeds for regulating the crystallization and growth of perovskite films. The resultant perovskite film exhibits larger domain sizes and fewer grain boundaries without compromising the band gap. Moreover, BPNCs can alleviate lattice strain and reduce defect densities within the active layer. The PSCs incorporating BPNCs show a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.41&#8201;%, well over both Control of 22.09&#8201;% and oleic acid/oleylamine capped CsPbI3 NC (PNC)&#8208;based devices of 23.11&#8201;%. This work illustrates the key role of nanosized seed surfaces in achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Scintillators for X&#8208;Ray Imaging Through Host&#8208;Guest Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve organic scintillators through constructing host&#8208;guest doping system was demonstrated. When doping guest materials with different triplet state energy levels, readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm) were achieved under X&#8208;ray excitation. The developed system also enabled color&#8208;tunable NIR X&#8208;ray imaging and provided a convenient visualization tool for X&#8208;ray radiography.







Abstract
With the increasing demands of X&#8208;ray detection and medical diagnosis, organic scintillators with intense and tunable X&#8208;ray excited emission have been becoming important. To guarantee the X&#8208;ray absorption, heavy atoms were widely added in reported organic scintillators, which led to emission quenching. In this work, we propose a new strategy to realize organic scintillators through the host&#8208;guest doping strategy. Then the X&#8208;ray absorption centers (host) and emission centers (guest) are separated. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, these materials displayed intense and readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm). Besides, the relationship between the X&#8208;ray absorption and spatial arrangement of the heavy atoms in the host matrix was also revealed. The potential application of these wide&#8208;range color tunable organic host&#8208;guest scintillators in X&#8208;ray imaging were demonstrated. This work provides a new feasible strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic scintillators with tunable luminescence properties.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene Incorporated Thiazole Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenophene substitution is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials, because it can realize higher mobility, lower&#8208;lying LUMO level compared with thiophene analogues. Here, we synthesize a thiazole imide&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer with maximum selenophene content and achieve a champion conductivity of 164.0&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is more than twice of that of selenophene&#8208;free analogue.







Abstract
Developing polymers with high electrical conductivity (&#963;) after n&#8208;doping is a great challenge for the advance of the field of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we report a series of thiazole imide&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers by gradually increasing selenophene content in polymeric backbone. Thanks to the strong intramolecular noncovalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interaction and enhanced intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se interaction, with the increase of selenophene content, the polymers show gradually lowered LUMOs, more planar backbone, and improved film crystallinity versus the selenophene&#8208;free analogue. Consequently, polymer PDTzSI&#8722;Se with the highest selenophene content achieves a champion &#963; of 164.0&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 49.0&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in the series when applied in OTEs after n&#8208;doping. The &#963; value is the highest one for n&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor OTE materials reported to date. Our work indicates that selenophene substitution is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OTE materials and selenophene incorporated thiazole imides offer an excellent platform in enabling n&#8208;type polymers with high backbone coplanarity, deep&#8208;lying LUMO and enhanced mobility/conductivity.

         <title>Simple and Efficient Synthesis of Novel Tetramers with Enhanced Glass Transition Temperature for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious synthesis strategy is proposed for novel tetramers with higher glass transition temperatures (Tg), simplifying intricate reaction steps and reducing synthetic complexity. The resulting Tet&#8208;1&#8208;based organic solar cell (OSC) demonstrates superior photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the higher Tg and lower diffusion coefficient contribute to excellent stability in the binary device.







Abstract
Oligomer acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered substantial attention owing to their impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability. However, the simple and efficient synthesis of oligomer acceptors with higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we propose an innovative strategy for the synthesis of tetramers, denoted as Tet&#8208;n, with elevated Tgs, achieved through only two consecutive Stille coupling reactions. Importantly, our strategy significantly reduces the redundancy in reaction steps compared to conventional methods for linear tetramer synthesis, thereby improving both reaction efficiency and yield. Furthermore, the OSC based on PM6:Tet&#8208;1 attains a high PCE of 17.32&#8201;%, and the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:Tet&#8208;1 ternary device achieves an even more higher PCE of 19.31&#8201;%. Remarkably, the binary device based on the Tet&#8208;1 tetramer demonstrates outstanding operational stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency (T80) even after 1706&#8197;h of continuous illumination, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced Tg (247&#8201;&#176;C) and lower diffusion coefficient (1.56&#215;10&#8722;27&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1). This work demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in the straightforward and efficient synthesis of tetramers materials with higher Tgs, thus offering a viable pathway for developing high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.

         <title>Formation of a Reactive [Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV)] Species and its Facile Equilibrium with Related Mn(IV)(OX) (X = Sc or H) Complexes</title>

Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;bound high&#8208;valent manganese&#8208;oxo species are important in understanding the role of Ca(II) ion in photosystem II. We present the synthesis and spectroscopic assessment of a novel Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV) species. This species opens up a new pathway for the synthesis of Mn(IV)&#8722;O&#8722;Sc(III) and Mn(IV)&#8722;OH, which are relevant to photosystem II.







Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;bound high valent Mn&#8208;oxo species are of great importance due to their relevance to photosystem II. Here, we report the synthesis of a unique [(BnTPEN)Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV)(NO3)4]+ adduct (2) by the reaction of (BnTPEN)Mn(II) (1) with 4&#8197;eq. ceric ammonium nitrate. 2 has been characterized using UV/Vis, NMR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry. Treatment of 2 with Sc(III)(OTf)3 results in the formation of (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8722;O&#8722;Sc(III) (3), while HClO4 addition to 2 forms (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8722;OH (4), reverting to 2 upon Ce(III)(NO3)3 addition. 2 can also be prepared by the oxidation of 1&#8197;eq. Ce(III)(NO3)3 with [(BnTPEN)Mn(IV)=O]2+ (5). In addition, the EPR spectroscopy revealed the elegant temperature&#8208;dependent equilibria between 2 and Mn(IV) species. The binding of redox&#8208;active Ce(IV) boosts electron transfer efficiency of 2 towards ferrocenes. Remarkably, the newly characterized Mn(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Ce(IV) species can carry out O&#8208;atom and H&#8208;atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Sculpting Mesoscopic Helical Chirality into Covalent Organic Framework Nanotubes from Entirely Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;, and hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with unique mesoscopic helical chirality were constructed from entirely achiral building blocks using helical amorphous imine&#8208;linked polymers as raw materials based on dynamic covalent chemistries. The crystallinity and helicity of the resulting COFs could be well balanced despite the whole process involved the covalent bonding breakage and reorganization.







Abstract
The diversification of chirality in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) holds immense promise for expanding their properties and functionality. Herein, we introduce an innovative approach for imparting helical chirality to COFs and fabricating a family of chiral COF nanotubes with mesoscopic helicity from entirely achiral building blocks for the first time. We present an effective 2,3&#8208;diaminopyridine&#8208;mediated supramolecular templating method, which facilitates the prefabrication of helical imine&#8208;linked polymer nanotubes using unprecedented achiral symmetric monomers. Through meticulous optimization of crystallization conditions, these helical polymer nanotubes are adeptly converted into imine&#8208;linked COF nanotubes boasting impressive surface areas, while well preserving their helical morphology and chiroptical properties. Furthermore, these helical imine&#8208;linked polymers or COFs could be subtly transformed into corresponding more stable and functional helical &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked and hydrazone&#8208;linked COF nanotubes with transferred circular dichroism via monomer exchange. Notably, despite the involvement of covalent bonding breakage and reorganization, these exchange processes overcome thermodynamic disadvantages, allowing mesoscopic helical chirality to be perfectly preserved. This research highlights the potential of mesoscopic helicity in conferring COFs with favourable chiral properties, providing novel insights into the development of multifunctional COFs in the field of chiral materials chemistry.

         <title>Ultralight Ultrafast Enzymes

An M9 minimum media based on 13C&#8208;depleted glucose and 15N&#8208;depleted salt dissolved in D,18O&#8208;depleted water (Depleted media) was formulated. E. coli bacteria grow faster in Depleted media compared with isotopically natural media (Normal media). In addition, four different enzymes recombinantly produced in Depleted media showed faster kinetics compared with the enzymes produced in Normal media.







Abstract
Inorganic materials depleted of heavy stable isotopes are known to deviate strongly in some physicochemical properties from their isotopically natural counterparts. Here we explored for the first time the effect of simultaneous depletion of the heavy carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes on the bacterium E. coli and the enzymes expressed in it. Bacteria showed faster growth, with most proteins exhibiting higher thermal stability, while for recombinant enzymes expressed in depleted media, faster kinetics was discovered. At room temperature, luciferase, thioredoxin and dihydrofolate reductase and Pfu DNA polymerase showed up to a 250&#8201;% increase in activity compared to the native counterparts, with an additional &#8764;50&#8201;% increase at 10&#8201;&#176;C. Diminished conformational and vibrational entropy is hypothesized to be the cause of the accelerated kinetics. Ultralight enzymes may find an application where extreme reaction rates are required.

         <title>Triptycene Branched Poly(aryl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) Electrolytes for Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells and Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional and highly rigid triptycene was applied in poly(fluorene/dibenzyl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) as a branching agent for alkaline exchange polyelectrolytes, which shows excellent conductivity, mechanical properties, anti&#8208;swelling ability, and alkaline stability. The water electrolysis performance reaches current densities of 16 and 14.17&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using precious and non&#8208;precious catalysts in anode, respectively.







Abstract
Alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs) are essential materials for alkaline energy conversion devices such as anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Here, we report a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) with different branching agents (triptycene: highly&#8208;rigid, three&#8208;dimensional structure; triphenylbenzene: planar, two&#8208;dimensional structure) for high&#8208;performance APEs. Among them, triptycene branched APEs showed excellent hydroxide conductivity (193.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1@80&#8201;&#176;C), alkaline stability, mechanical properties, and dimensional stability due to the formation of branched network structures, and increased free volume. AEMFCs based on triptycene&#8208;branched APEs reached promising peak power densities of 2.503 and 1.705&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 75/100&#8201;% and 30/30&#8201;% (anode/cathode) relative humidity, respectively. In addition, the fuel cells can run stably at a current density of 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;h with a low voltage decay rate of 46&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1. Importantly, the related AEMWE achieved unprecedented current densities of 16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 14.17&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (@2&#8197;V, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;M NaOH) using precious and non&#8208;precious metal catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the AEMWE can be stably operated under 1.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;h. The excellent results suggest that the triptycene&#8208;branched APEs are promising candidates for future AEMFC and AEMWE applications.

         <title>Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidation of Styrenes into Ketones under Ambient Conditions Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex was found to be a highly active and Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalyst for the Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of aromatic olefins into ketones under ambient conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies including kinetics, UV/Vis, control experiments and DFT calculations indicate a Mukaiyama&#8208;type mechanism with a change in the last fundamental step towards ketone formation via an unprecedented hydrogen bonding network thanks to the ethanol solvent.







Abstract
The replacement of palladium catalysts for Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins into ketones by first&#8208;row transition metals is a relevant approach for searching more sustainable protocols. Besides highly sophisticated iron catalysts, all the other first&#8208;row transition metal complexes have only led to poor activities and selectivities. Herein, we show that the cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex is a competent catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of styrenes into ketones with silanes as the hydrogen sources. Remarkably, under room temperature and air atmosphere, the reactions were exceedingly fast (up to 10&#8197;minutes) with a low catalyst loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) while keeping an excellent chemo&#8208; and Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity (up to 99&#8201;% of ketone). Unprecedently high TOF (864&#8197;h&#8722;1) and TON (5,800) were reached for the oxidation of aromatic olefins under these benign conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest a reaction mechanism similar to the Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration of olefins with a change in the last fundamental step, which controls the chemoselectivity, thanks to a unique hydrogen bonding network between the ethanol solvent and the cobalt peroxo intermediate.

         <title>Non&#8208;Metallic NH4+/H+ Co&#8208;Storage in Organic Superstructures for Ultra&#8208;Fast and Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;metallic NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage is reported in high&#8208;redox&#8208;active carbonyls fully exposed organic superstructures, which conquers the kinetics barrier of sluggish Zn2+ ions and structural instability of repeated Zn2+ insertion in aqueous electrolytes. A two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron NH4+/H+ co&#8208;coordination mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, superior rate capability and ultralong life.







Abstract
Compared with Zn2+ storage, non&#8208;metallic charge carrier with small hydrated size and light weight shows fast dehydration and diffusion kinetics for Zn&#8208;organic batteries. Here we first report NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage in self&#8208;assembled organic superstructures (OSs) by intermolecular interactions of p&#8208;benzoquinone (BQ) and 2, 6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DQ) polymer through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. BQ&#8208;DQ OSs exhibit exposed quadruple&#8208;active carbonyl motifs and super electron delocalization routes, which are redox&#8208;exclusively coupled with high&#8208;kinetics NH4+/H+ but exclude sluggish and rigid Zn2+ ions. A unique 4e&#8722; NH4+/H+ co&#8208;coordination mechanism is unravelled, giving BQ&#8208;DQ cathode high capacity (299&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current tolerance (100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultralong life (50,000 cycles). This strategy further boosts the capacity to 358&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 by modulating redox&#8208;active building units, giving new insights into ultra&#8208;fast and stable NH4+/H+ storage in organic materials for better Zn batteries.

         <title>An Electrolyte with Less Space&#8208;Occupying Diluent at Cathode Inner Helmholtz Plane for Stable 4.6&#8197;V Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) and anion (DFOB&#8722;) is weak due to the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation structure of mFT, thus excluding mFT from the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). This facilitates the formation of an anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), enabling the graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell an excellent 4.6&#8197;V&#8208;cycling stability.







Abstract
Reasonably elevating the working voltage (&#8805;4.4&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) of the cathode is one of the efficient approaches to maximize the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). As a preferred partner for high&#8208;voltage LIB systems, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE), characterized by a stronger Li solvation structure, less free solvent, and robust electrode/electrolyte interphase has attracted much attention in academic circles. Herein, we systematically studied the role of the diluent in LHCE on the formation of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and elucidated that the existing anion&#8208;diluent pairing in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) results in an uneven CEI and subsequent battery degradation under high voltage. A m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) diluent was further employed in the LHCE containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) to facilitate a uniform and rich&#8208;anion&#8208;derived CEI, since the weaker interaction of HmFT&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, as compared to the HHhydrofluoroether&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, reduces the influence of mFT in IHP or initial CEI formation. Consequently, the mFT&#8208;dominated LHCE propels the high&#8208;voltage performance of LIBs one step forward, endowing a 4.6&#8197;V&#8208;class 1.2&#8208;Ah graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells a 90.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 130&#8197;cycles. Our study thus describes a new index affecting the CEI formation and proposes novel strategies to deeply optimize the high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Oxygen Vacancy and High Porosity of Nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for Enhanced Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 via the low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy possesses abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area, which facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. This work provides new possibilities for designing nano MOFs with controllable surface&#8208;active sites and high porosity.







Abstract
This work reports that a low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy was adopted to modulate the electronic structure and attain an abundance of surface&#8208;active sites while maintaining the crystal morphology. All the experiments demonstrate that the new photocatalyst nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 obtained by thermal calcination strategy has abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area. This facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The photocatalytic NH3 yield over MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 is enhanced to 156.9&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, over twice higher than that of the parent MIL&#8208;125(Ti) (76.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Combined with density function theory (DFT), it shows that the N2 adsorption pattern on the active sites tends to be from &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, which is thermodynamically favourable. Moreover, the electrochemical tests demonstrate that the high atomic ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ can enhance carrier separation, which also promotes the efficiency of photocatalytic N2 fixation. This work may offer new insights into the design of innovative photocatalysts for various chemical reduction reactions.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Modulated 2D Coordination Polymers for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis under Air and Pure Water Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers CuX&#8208;dptz were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at the gram level. CuX&#8208;dptz exhibits H2O2 photoproduction activity under pure water and open air without additives through an oxygen reduction process. The microenvironment of the Cu sites can be regulated by halogen atoms, which affects the electron transfer capability and substrate accessibility, and ultimately determines the catalytic activity.







Abstract
H2O2 is a widely used eco&#8208;friendly oxidant and a potential energy carrier. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from water and O2 is an ideal approach with the potential to address the current energy crisis and environmental issues. Three zig&#8208;zag two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D CPs), named CuX&#8208;dptz, were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at room temperature, showing preeminent H2O2 photoproduction performance under pure water and open air without any additives. CuBr&#8208;dptz exhibits a H2O2 production rate high up to 1874&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, exceeding most reported photocatalysts under this condition, even comparable to those supported by sacrificial agents and O2. The coordination environment of Cu can be modulated by halogen atoms (X=Cl, Br, I), which in turn affects the electron transfer process and finally determines the reaction activity. This is the first time that 2D CPs have been used for photocatalytic H2O2 production in such challenging conditions, which provides a new pathway for the development of portable in situ H2O2 photosynthesis devices.

&lt;p&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a widely used eco-friendly oxidant and a potential energy carrier. Photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from water and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an ideal approach with the potential to address the current energy crisis and environmental issues. Three zig-zag two-dimensional coordination polymers (2D CPs), named CuX-dptz, were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at room temperature, showing preeminent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoproduction performance under pure water and open air without any additives. CuBr-dptz exhibits a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate high up to 1874&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, exceeding most reported photocatalysts under this condition, even comparable to those supported by sacrificial agents and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The coordination environment of Cu can be modulated by halogen atoms (X=Cl, Br, I), which in turn affects the electron transfer process and finally determines the reaction activity. This is the first time that 2D CPs have been used for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in such challenging conditions, which provides a new pathway for the development of portable in situ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Click to Self&#8208;immolation: A &#8220;Click&#8221; Functionalization Strategy towards Triggerable Self&#8208;Immolative Homopolymers and Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; approach based on a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol&#8208;isocyanate reaction was developed to functionalize self&#8208;immolative polymer precursors with varying trigger units and allow polymer&#8208;polymer coupling to access head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerizable block copolymers, which could undergo programmable self&#8208;immolation in response to specified stimuli.







Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are a class of degradable macromolecules that undergo stimuli&#8208;triggered head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerization. However, a general approach to readily end&#8208;functionalize SIP precursors for programmed degradation remains elusive, restricting access to complex, functional SIP&#8208;based materials. Here we present a &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; strategy based on aroyl azide&#8208;capped SIP precursors, enabling the facile construction of diverse SIPs with different trigger units through a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol/thiol&#8208;isocyanate &#8220;click&#8221; reaction. This strategy is also applied to polymer&#8208;polymer coupling to access fully depolymerizable block copolymer amphiphiles, even combining different SIP backbones. Our results demonstrate that the depolymerization can be actuated efficiently under physiologically&#8208;relevant conditions by the removal of the trigger units and ensuing self&#8208;immolation of the p&#8208;aminobenzyl carbonate linkage, indicating promise for controlled release applications involving nanoparticles and hydrogels.

         <title>A Universal Approach for Sustainable Urea Synthesis via Intermediate Assembly at the Electrode/Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling shows great potential in sustainable urea synthesis. We proposed a universal strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C&#8722;N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+&lt;Na+&lt;Cs+&lt;K+. With 1.0&#8197;M of K+, a world&#8208;record urea yield rate of 212.8&#177;10.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 has been achieved on a single&#8208;atom Co decorated TiO2 catalyst.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process is indeed a sustainable alternative for direct urea synthesis and co&#8208;upgrading of carbon dioxide and nitrate wastes. However, the main challenge lies in the unactivated C&#8722;N coupling process. Here, we proposed a strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C&#8722;N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+&lt;Na+&lt;Cs+&lt;K+. In the presence of K+, a world&#8208;record performance was achieved with a urea yield rate of 212.8&#177;10.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 on a single&#8208;atom Co supported TiO2 catalyst at &#8722;0.80&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Theoretical calculations and operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the energy barriers of C&#8722;N coupling were significantly decreased via K+ mediated intermediate assembly. By applying this strategy to various catalysts, we demonstrate that intermediate assembly at the electrode/electrolyte interface is a universal approach to boost sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy and Ruthenium Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Pairs to Boost the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru cluster anchored on oxygen vacancy (VO)&#8208;enriched amorphous/crystalline CeO2 (Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948;) electrocatalyst was designed for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, in which the unique interfacial VO&#8208;Ru Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs facilitated the adsorption of H2O, cleavage of H&#8208;OH bonds and H2 desorption, meanwhile the desorption of OH from VO sites was accelerated via a water&#8208;assisted proton exchange pathway, thus boosting the overall HER kinetics.







Abstract
Simultaneous optimization of the energy level of water dissociation, hydrogen and hydroxide desorption is the key to achieving fast kinetics for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the well&#8208;dispersed Ru clusters on the surface of amorphous/crystalline CeO2&#8208;&#948; (Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948;) is demonstrated to be an excellent electrocatalyst for significantly boosting the alkaline HER kinetics owing to the presence of unique oxygen vacancy (VO) and Ru Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs (LABPs). The representative Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948; exhibits an outstanding mass activity of 7180&#8197;mA&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 that is approximately 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C at the potential of &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (V vs RHE) and an extremely low overpotential of 21.2&#8197;mV at a geometric current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the VO as Lewis acid sites facilitate the adsorption of H2O and cleavage of H&#8208;OH bonds, meanwhile, the weak Lewis basic Ru clusters favor for the hydrogen desorption. Importantly, the desorption of OH from VO sites is accelerated via a water&#8208;assisted proton exchange pathway, and thus boost the kinetics of alkaline HER. This study sheds new light on the design of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts with LABPs for the enhanced alkaline HER.

         <title>Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based Catalysts by Tuning Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust Ni/ZrO2 catalyst with exceptional low&#8208;temperature CO2 methanation performance even at 230&#8201;&#176;C (350&#8201;&#176;C for most of reported catalysts) via tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and electron density of active sites. The potential different reaction mechanisms were well illustrated by experimental analysis.







Abstract
Rational design of low&#8208;cost and efficient transition&#8208;metal catalysts for low&#8208;temperature CO2 activation is significant and poses great challenges. Herein, a strategy via regulating the local electron density of active sites is developed to boost CO2 methanation that normally requires &gt;350&#8201;&#176;C for commercial Ni catalysts. An optimal Ni/ZrO2 catalyst affords an excellent low&#8208;temperature performance hitherto, with a CO2 conversion of 84.0&#8201;%, CH4 selectivity of 98.6&#8201;% even at 230&#8201;&#176;C and GHSV of 12,000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for 106&#8197;h, reflecting one of the best CO2 methanation performance to date on Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Combined a series of in situ spectroscopic characterization studies reveal that re&#8208;constructing monoclinic&#8208;ZrO2 supported Ni species with abundant oxygen vacancies can facilitate CO2 activation, owing to the enhanced local electron density of Ni induced by the strong metal&#8208;support interactions. These findings might be of great aid for construction of robust catalysts with an enhanced performance for CO2 emission abatement and beyond.

     alt="Boosting Low-Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation over Ni-based Catalysts by Tuning Strong Metal-Support Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a robust Ni/ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with exceptional low-temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation performance even at 230&#8201;&#176;C (350&#8201;&#176;C for most of reported catalysts) via tuning the strong metal-support interactions and electron density of active sites. The potential different reaction mechanisms were well illustrated by experimental analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational design of low-cost and efficient transition-metal catalysts for low-temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation is significant and poses great challenges. Herein, a strategy via regulating the local electron density of active sites is developed to boost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation that normally requires &amp;gt;350&#8201;&#176;C for commercial Ni catalysts. An optimal Ni/ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst affords an excellent low-temperature performance hitherto, with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion of 84.0&#8201;%, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 98.6&#8201;% even at 230&#8201;&#176;C and GHSV of 12,000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 106&#8197;h, reflecting one of the best CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation performance to date on Ni-based catalysts. Combined a series of in situ spectroscopic characterization studies reveal that re-constructing &lt;i&gt;monoclinic&lt;/i&gt;-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supported Ni species with abundant oxygen vacancies can facilitate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, owing to the enhanced local electron density of Ni induced by the strong metal-support interactions. These findings might be of great aid for construction of robust catalysts with an enhanced performance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission abatement and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A class of non&#8208;covalently stapled H+/Cl&#8722;&#160;ion channels&#160;activatable by visible light is presented by Changliang Ren et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202314666). Photoirradiation of the precursor molecules results in the release of channel&#8208;forming molecules with two different conformations. These molecules self&#8208;assemble into 1D channels, enabling efficient co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722;&#160;across the membrane and yielding a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells.

A redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from diaminotriazine&#8208;decorated hexaazatrinaphthalene and used as the cathode material in aqueous zinc ion batteries, as reported by Fengchao Cui, Heng&#8208;Guo Wang, Guangshan Zhu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202314411). The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow the HOF with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, a stable supramolecular structure and enhanced H+ storage.

An azepine ring as an exotic fusing motif in the 21&#8208;carbaselenaporphyrinoid dyads is reported by Anna Berlicka, Lechos&#322;aw Latos&#8208;Gra&#380;y&#324;ski et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202314925). The covalently linked dyads exhibit a unique geometry, characterized by a canted arrangement of two carbaselenaporphyrinic planes. The dimerization process occurs via a [5+2] cycloaddition reaction.

Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metallo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring coordination is reported by Jun Li, Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202313491). The unexpected coordination, which is different from the common organo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination, serves single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered Pd nanoclusters with exceptional stability. Furthermore, the dominant horizontal electron transition induces strong optical absorption and promising photothermal conversion efficiency of the Pd8&#160;nanocluster with well&#8208;defined composition and structure.

         <title>Bifunctional Peptide Nanofibrils for Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimera) method, reported by Zhang et&#8197;al., uses self&#8208;assembling peptides as carriers of POI (protein of interest) and E3 ligase ligands. Cellular nanofibrils built upon the peptide assembly can serve as degradation centers (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) through the formation of polynary POI:Nano&#8208;PROTAC&#8201;:&#8201;E3 complexes. This strategy has the potential to overcome the hook effect of traditional PROTACs.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for ablating undruggable targets. A PROTAC degrader achieves targeted protein degradation (TPD) through the simultaneous binding of a protein of interest (POI) and an E3 ligase to form a ternary complex. A nanofibril&#8208;based PROTAC strategy to form a polynary (E3)m&#8201;:&#8201;PROTAC&#8201;:&#8201;(POI)n complex has not been reported in the TPD field up to this point. A recent innovation shows that a POI ligand and E3 ligase ligand don't have to be within a fused degrader molecule. Instead, they can be recruited to cellular proximity by a self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driving peptide and click chemistry. The resulting nanofibrils can recruit multiple POI and E3 ligase molecules to form a polynary complex as a degradation center. The so&#8208;called Nano&#8208;PROTAC provides a novel approach for TPD in cancer therapy.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomers Bearing Multiple Chiral Elements: An Emerging Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements has recently become an emerging research field. Chemists have devised metal&#8208;catalyzed or organocatalytic asymmetric reactions for accessing atropisomers with multiple chiral elements, such as those with center chirality, planar chirality, and helical chirality. This review summarizes the rapid developments in this field and indicated the remaining challenges.







Abstract
With the rapid development of asymmetric catalysis, the demand for the enantioselective synthesis of complex and diverse molecules with different chiral elements is increasing. Owing to the unique features of atropisomerism, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has attracted a considerable interest from the chemical science community. In particular, introducing additional chiral elements, such as carbon centered chirality, heteroatomic chirality, planar chirality, and helical chirality, into atropisomers provides an opportunity to incorporate new properties into axially chiral compounds, thus expanding the potential applications of atropisomers. Thus, it is important to perform catalytic asymmetric transformations to synthesize atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements. In spite of challenges in such transformations, in recent years, chemists have devised powerful strategies under asymmetric organocatalysis or metal catalysis, synthesizing a wide range of enantioenriched atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements. Therefore, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements has become an emerging field. This review summarizes the rapid progress in this field and indicates challenges, thereby promoting this field to a new horizon.

         <title>Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol Catalysed by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the opportunities offered by metal&#8211;organic frameworks for the selective gas&#8208;phase CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. Emphasis is provided to illustrate their flexibility in design and synthesis to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes, the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity to determine the activity and selectivity are also discussed.







Abstract
Large scale production of green CH3OH obtained from CO2 and green H2 is a highly wanted process due to the role of CH3OH as H2/energy carrier and for producing chemicals. Starting with a short summary of the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts in liquid&#8208;phase reactions, the present article highlights the opportunities that MOFs may offer also for some gas&#8208;phase reactions, particularly for the selective CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. It is commented that there is a temperature compatibility window that combines the thermal stability of some MOFs with the temperature required in the CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH that frequently ranges from 250 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. The existing literature in this area is briefly organized according to the role of MOF as providing the active sites or as support of active metal nanoparticles (NPs). Emphasis is made to show how the flexibility in design and synthesis of MOFs can be used to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes and the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity, as well as the role that should play theoretical calculations in models have also been highlighted.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Systems for NOx Valorization in Organonitrogen Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic systems for NOx reduction species provide a promising way for synthetic value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds, which not only brings novel insights for handling environmental problems caused by NOx, but also pave a new clue for the development of electrosynthesis, application of water splitting, fixing nitrogen circle and understanding the origins of life to build a sustainable society.







Abstract
Inorganic nitrogen oxide (NOx) species, such as NO, NO2, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722; generated from the decomposition of organic matters, volcanic eruptions and lightning activated nitrogen, play important roles in the nitrogen cycle system and exploring the origin of life. Meanwhile, excessive emission of NOx gases and residues from industry and transportation causes troubling problems to the environment and human health. How to efficiently handle these wastes is a global problem. In response to the growing demand for sustainability, scientists are actively pursuing sustainable electrochemical technologies powered by renewable energy sources and efficient utilization of hydrogen energy to convert NOx species into high&#8208;value organonitrogen chemicals. In this minireview, recent advances of electrocatalytic systems for NOx species valorization in organonitrogen synthesis are classified and described, such as amino acids, amide, urea, oximes, nitrile etc., that have been widely applied in medicine, life science and agriculture. Additionally, the current challenges including multiple side reactions and complicated paths, viable solutions along with future directions ahead in this field are also proposed. The coupling electrocatalytic systems provide a green mode for fixing nitrogen cycle bacteria and bring enlightenment to human sustainable development.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Lewis Pairs in the Assembly of Supramolecular Macrocycles, Molecular Cages, Polymers, and 3D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;nitrogen Lewis pairs (LPs) serve as versatile motifs that not only facilitate self&#8208;assembly but also endow macromolecules with unique characteristics. The dynamic nature of the dative bonding is exploited in the generation of new macrocycles, molecular cages, 1D polymers, and 3D networks with interesting optical and electronic properties, host&#8211;guest characteristics, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;shifting properties.







Abstract
Covering an exceptionally wide range of bond strengths, the dynamic nature and facile tunability of dative B&#8722;N bonds is highly attractive when it comes to the assembly of supramolecular polymers and materials. This Minireview offers an overview of advances in the development of functional materials where Lewis pairs (LPs) play a key role in their assembly and critically influence their properties. Specifically, we describe the reversible assembly of linear polymers with interesting optical, electronic and catalytic properties, discrete macrocycles and molecular cages that take up diverse guest molecules and undergo structural changes triggered by external stimuli, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intriguing interlocked structures that can embed and separate gases such as CO2 and acetylene, and soft polymer networks that serve as recyclable, self&#8208;healing, and responsive thermosets, gels and elastomeric materials.

         <title>Cyclic Peptides for Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptides combine a number of favorable properties that make them attractive for drug development. Today, more than 40 therapeutics based on cyclic peptides are in use, and new, powerful technologies for their development suggest that this number could grow rapidly. In this review, we feature cyclic peptide drugs developed in the past, discuss the properties of this molecule class, describe technological advances, and discuss current challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of cyclic peptide therapeutics.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are fascinating molecules abundantly found in nature and exploited as molecular format for drug development as well as other applications, ranging from research tools to food additives. Advances in peptide technologies made over many years through improved methods for synthesis and drug development have resulted in a steady stream of new drugs, with an average of around one cyclic peptide drug approved per year. Powerful technologies for screening random peptide libraries, and de novo generating ligands, have enabled the development of cyclic peptide drugs independent of naturally derived molecules and now offer virtually unlimited development opportunities. In this review, we feature therapeutically relevant cyclic peptides derived from nature and discuss the unique properties of cyclic peptides, the enormous technological advances in peptide ligand development in recent years, and current challenges and opportunities for developing cyclic peptides that address unmet medical needs.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allene C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation</title>

         <dc:description>
While hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regioselective allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization via direct HAA from the allene represents an inherent challenge and remains an unsolved problem. Herein, we report a copper catalyzed allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of several tri&#8208;, di&#8208; and mono&#8208;substituted allenes with exceptional site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
While the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, the radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond via direct HAA from C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of allene remains an unsolved challenge in synthetic chemistry. This is primarily due to inherent challenges with addition of radical intermediates to allenes, regioselectivity of HAA process, instability of allenyl radical toward propargyl radical et&#8197;al. Herein, we report a copper catalyzed allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of an array of tri&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted allenes with exceptional site&#8208;selectivity, while mono&#8208;substituted allene was successfully cyanated, albeit with a low yield. In the developed strategy, steric N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;alkylsulfonamide, serving as precursor of hydrogen atom abstractor, plays a crucial role in achieving the desired regioselectivity and avoiding addition of N&#8208;centered radical to allene.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Proteolysis Targeting Chimera Enables Targeting the Scaffolding Functions of FK506&#8208;Binding Protein 51 (FKBP51)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FK506&#8208;binding site of FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is chemically tractable but not required for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) repression by FKBP51. The proteolysis targeting chimera SelDeg51 enables degradation of FKBP51, abolishes its scaffolding functions, and reactivates GR signaling.







Abstract
The FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a promising target in a variety of disorders including depression, chronic pain, and obesity. Previous FKBP51&#8208;targeting strategies were restricted to occupation of the FK506&#8208;binding site, which does not affect core functions of FKBP51. Here, we report the discovery of the first FKBP51 proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that enables degradation of FKBP51 abolishing its scaffolding function. Initial synthesis of 220 FKBP&#8208;focused PROTACs yielded a plethora of active PROTACs for FKBP12, six for FKBP51, and none for FKBP52. Structural analysis of a binary FKBP12:PROTAC complex revealed the molecular basis for negative cooperativity. Linker&#8208;based optimization of first generation FKBP51 PROTACs led to the PROTAC SelDeg51 with improved cellular activity, selectivity, and high cooperativity. The structure of the ternary FKBP51:SelDeg51:VCB complex revealed how SelDeg51 establishes cooperativity by dimerizing FKBP51 and the von Hippel&#8208;Lindau protein (VHL) in a glue&#8208;like fashion. SelDeg51 efficiently depletes FKBP51 and reactivates glucocorticoid receptor (GR)&#8208;signalling, highlighting the enhanced efficacy of full protein degradation compared to classical FKBP51 binding.

         <title>21&#8208;Carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoid Dyads&#8212;An Azepine Unit as a Merging Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently linked selenacarbaporphyrinic dyads exhibit a unique open seashell architecture. These structures were formed via the [5+2] cycloaddition reaction, creating a unifying azepine motif.







Abstract
The oxidation of 10,15&#8208;diaryl&#8208;21&#8208;carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoids resulted in the creation of dyads. The dimerization process follows a [5+2] cycloaddition path with the formation of an azepine unit. The arrays display two direct bonds between the peripheral carbocyclic carbon atoms of one carbaselenaporphyrinic subunit and the central carbon and nitrogen atoms of the second subunit. This results in a unique canted arrangement of two carbaporphyrinoid planes resembling an open seashell&#8208;like motif.

         <title>Diborodichloromethane as Versatile Reagent for Chemodivergent Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) has been developed. DBDCM serves as a versatile building block for the synthesis of structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM result in various tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. Isotopic enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents are also synthesized.







Abstract
The development of boron reagents is crucial for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a scalable and practical synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) through the reaction of trichloromethyllithium with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The resulting DBDCM reagent serves as a basic synthetic unit for the construction of various structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Moreover, we have developed consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM for the construction of diverse tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. The use of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;chloroform and 10B2pin2 enables the synthesis of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents, which are beneficial for the convenient synthesis of carbon&#8208;13 and boron&#8208;10 molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)Aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One&#8208;Pot Sulfur&#8208;Arylation and Dealkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids is reported. Broad scope and high functional group compatibility were observed including for late&#8208;stage incorporation of sulfenamide functionality in complex drugs and drug precursors. Sulfur&#8208;functionalization then enables the synthesis of diverse, medicinally relevant high oxidation state sulfur pharmacophores.







Abstract
A general one&#8208;pot approach to diverse N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from a common S&#8208;phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8722;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to N&#8208;acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide S&#8208;substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one&#8208;pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8722;S bond formation.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Arboduridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid arboduridine has been accomplished. The synthesis features a highly enantioselective Michael addition to establish the vicinal sterically congested quaternary C7 and tertiary C19 stereocenters. The other stereogenic centers in this core unit were installed in a stereospecific and sequential fashion by taking advantage of the conformations of the corresponding precursors.







Abstract
The first asymmetric total synthesis of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid arboduridine has been accomplished. The tricyclic A/B/D ring system was constructed by an enantioselective Michael reaction followed by intramolecular nucleophilic addition. Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;amination of a ketone forged the piperidine ring, while a Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons (HWE) reaction was used to form the pyrrolidine ring. A reduction cyclization cascade led to formation of the tetrahydrofuran ring.

         <title>Subnanometric Bismuth Clusters Confined in Pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 Enable Remarkable CO2 Photoreduction</title>

In situ construction of subnanometric metallic Bi clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 leads to more than a 20&#8208;fold enhancement of photocatalytic CO production from aqueous CO2 solution.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient photocatalysts for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) into chemical fuels is of great importance for energy sustainability and carbon resource utilization. Herein, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method for in situ construction of subnanometric Bi metallic clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 frameworks, leading to the remarkable improvements of photocatalytic performances for CO2 reduction into CO in the absence of sacrificial reagent. More specifically, an outstanding CO evolution activity of 114.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 has been achieved, more than 20&#8208;fold improvement compared with the pristine Bi2Sn2O7 (5.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Detailed experiments together with in situ characterizations reveal that the spatially confined Bi clusters could significantly promote charge&#8208;separation/electron&#8208;enrichment and adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, which provides highly efficient reaction channels to facilitate the generation of *COOH intermediate as well as the subsequent desorption of *CO towards CO formation. These demonstrations provide an important knowledge for precise design and fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion into solar fuels.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Degradation of Ether&#8208;Containing Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidative polymer degradation promoted by molecular oxygen provides an electrocatalytic degradation of polymers with activated C&#8722;H bonds, such as polyethers, poly(vinyl ethers), and polyether&#8208;based polyurethanes. A study of the mechanism, selectivity, and efficiency of this method led to the identification of oxidized small&#8208;molecule degradation products.







Abstract
Leveraging electrochemistry to degrade robust polymeric materials has the potential to impact society's growing issue of plastic waste. Herein, we develop an electrocatalytic oxidative degradation of polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) via electrochemically mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidative polymer degradation promoted by molecular oxygen. We investigated the selectivity and efficiency of this method, finding our conditions to be highly selective for polymers with hydridic, electron&#8208;rich C&#8722;H bonds. We leveraged this reactivity to degrade polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) in the presence of polymethacrylates and polyacrylates with complete selectivity. Furthermore, this method made polyacrylates degradable by incorporation of ether units into the polymer backbone. We quantified degradation products, identifying up to 36&#8197;mol&#8201;% of defined oxidation products, including acetic acid, formic acid, and acetaldehyde, and we extended this method to degrade a polyether&#8208;based polyurethane in a green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile, electrochemically&#8208;driven route to degrade polymers containing ether functionalities.

Furthermore, this method made polyacrylates degradable by incorporation of ether units into the polymer backbone. We quantified degradation products, identifying up to 36&#8197;mol&#8201;% of defined oxidation products, including acetic acid, formic acid, and acetaldehyde, and we extended this method to degrade a polyether-based polyurethane in a green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile, electrochemically-driven route to degrade polymers containing ether functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lamellar Crystal Structure and Haldane Magnetism in NH4VPO4OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new compound, NH4VPO4OH, has been synthesized under mild hydrothermal condition. It possesses a lamellar crystal structure and shows a spin gap behavior inherent for the Haldane system. This rare ground state has been supported in the first&#8208;principles calculations.







Abstract
A novel vanadium hydroxide&#8208;phosphate, NH4VPO4OH, was synthesized hydrothermally in V2O5&#8722;NH4H2PO4&#8208;citric acid system at 230&#8201;&#176;C. It was characterized by XRD, TG&#8208;DSC, SEM&#8208;EDX, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. NH4VPO4OH is isostructural with NH4GaPO4OH and features edge&#8208;sharing chains of VO6 octahedra. These chains running along [010] direction of the unit cell are connected by phosphate tetrahedra to form infinite layers parallel to the (100) plane. Ammonium cations are embedded between the heteropolyhedral layers. According to the thermodynamic and NMR measurements supported by the first&#8208;principles calculations, NH4VPO4OH presents a rare case of Haldane spin system with spin S=1 based on V3+ ions.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Indoles via Carbene Catalyzed Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective synthesis of macrocyclic planar&#8208;chiral indoles via NHC&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular macrocyclization is reported. In addition, the indole&#8208;based macrocycles bearing both planar and axial chirality have also been constructed via kinetic resolution. Importantly, these obtained planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles provide additional possibilities to develop novel catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.







Abstract
Indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles are widely found in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, in sharp contrast to the preparation of indole&#8208;based axially chiral structures, the enantioselective catalysis of indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles is still a formidable task so far. Here we report an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective macrocyclization of 3&#8208;carboxaldehyde indole/pyrroles, featuring with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and allowing for a rapid access to diverse indole/pyrrole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles with various tether&#8208;lengths (10&#8211;16 members) in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, the indole&#8208;based macrocyclic structures with both planar and axial chirality were directly and efficiently obtained through this protocol with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. In addition, these synthesized planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles offer many possibilities for chemists to develop new catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.

         <title>Breaking the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Ru Symmetry of a RuO2 Catalyst for Sustainable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In active structure exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance for acid oxygen evolution reaction, which is significantly enhanced by the contracted Ru&#8722;O bond compared to RuO2.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a highly promising hydrogen production technique for sustainable energy supply, however, achieving a highly active and durable catalyst for acidic water oxidation still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a local microenvironment regulation strategy for precisely tuning In&#8722;RuO2/graphene (In&#8722;RuO2/G) catalyst with intrinsic electrochemical activity and stability to boost acidic water oxidation. The In&#8722;RuO2/G displays robust acid oxygen evolution reaction performance with a mass activity of 671&#8197;A gcat&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V, an overpotential of 187&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;lasting stability of 350&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which arises from the asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In local structure interactions. Further, it is unraveled theoretically that the asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;In structure breaks the thermodynamic activity limit of the traditional adsorption evolution mechanism which significantly weakens the formation energy barrier of OOH*, thus inducing a new rate&#8208;determining step of OH* absorption. Therefore, this strategy showcases the immense potential for constructing high&#8208;performance acidic catalysts for water electrolyzers.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Hydrogen: Pushing the Limit of Multicentre Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 3, January 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom has been predicted for the first time in the global minimum D4h geometry of In4H+ cluster.







Abstract
Among the list of planar tetracoordinate atoms, the smallest element hydrogen is missing. No experimental and theoretical evidence have ever been put forwarded. Herein, we introduce the first planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom (ptH) in the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is acting like a proton and significant charge transfer from the surrounding In4 framework results in a negative charge of the central hydrogen atom. The proposed global minimum geometry possesses &#963;&#8208;aromaticity and the central hydrogen atom forms unusual multicentre bond with more than three centres.

&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;You know what, aromaticity is fun, but antiaromaticity is the real fun!'&#8230; We realized that while many DFT functionals are benchmarked for getting the correct geometries for aromatic compounds, what works for aromatic compounds may not work for antiaromatic compounds&#8230;&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Wu and Haley groups.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Prof. Judy&#8197;I. Wu, Department of Chemistry, University of Houston (USA) and Prof. Michael M. Haley, Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry and the Materials Science Institute, University of Oregon, Eugene (USA). The X&#8208;ray structure of tetra&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene was reported in 1986 to possess a symmetric, delocalized D2h geometry, which went against conventional wisdom that this antiaromatic should exhibit a bond&#8208;localized C2h structure. Computational studies over the ensuing 35+ years yielded conflicting outcomes as to the preferred geometry. A computational reexamination of this structure by our team found experimental proton chemical shifts matched best with a computed C2h symmetry, confirming a bond&#8208;localized geometry. &#8220;Tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a Bond&#8208;Localized C2h Structure and a Challenge for Computational Chemistry&#8221;, L.&#8197;J.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Calcium Overload from Endogenous Sources for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing reactive calcium&#8208;based nanogenerators to produce excess calcium ions (Ca2+) in tumor cells is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, nanogenerators that introduce exogenous Ca2+ are either overactive incapable of on&#8208;demand release, or excessively inert incapable of an overload of calcium rapidly. Herein, inspired by inherently diverse Ca2+&#8208;regulating channels, a photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ nanomodulator that fully utilizes endogenous Ca2+ from dual sources was designed to achieve Ca2+ overload in tumor cells. Specifically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used to co&#8208;load bifunctional indocyanine green as a photodynamic/photothermal agent and a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (BNN&#8208;6). Thereafter, they were coated with hyaluronic acid, which served as a tumor cell&#8208;targeting unit and a gatekeeper. Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate reactive oxygen species that stimulate the transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel to realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. Simultaneously, the converted heat can induce BNN&#8208;6 decomposition to generate NO, which would open the ryanodine receptor channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ influx and release could enable Ca2+ overload in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single Set of Well&#8208;Designed Aptamer Probes for Reliable On&#8208;site Qualitative and Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Quantitative Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer&#8208;based probes are pivotal components in various sensing strategies, owing to their exceptional specificity and versatile programmable structure. Nevertheless, numerous aptamer&#8208;based probes usually offer only a single function, limiting their capacity to meet the diverse requirements of multi&#8208;faceted sensing systems. Here, we introduced supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA), designed and modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls, enabling dual functionality: qualitative detection for on&#8208;site analysis and quantitative detection for precise analysis. The fragmented DNAs resulting from the target recognition, are subsequently identified through lateral flow assays, enabling robust on&#8208;site qualitative detection of microcystin&#8208;LR with an impressively low limit of detection (LOD) at 0.01 &#956;g/L. Meanwhile, the nanochannels enable highly sensitive quantification of microcystin&#8208;LR through the current analysis, achieving an exceptionally low LOD at 2.5 &#215; 10&#8208;7 &#956;g/L, with a broad dynamic range spanning from 1 &#215; 10&#8208;6 to 1 &#215; 102 &#956;g/L. Furthermore, the process of target recognition introduces just a single potential error propagation, which reduces the overall risk of errors during the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process. This sensing strategy broadens the scope of applications for aptamer&#8208;based composite probes, holding promising implications across diverse fields, such as medical diagnosis, food safety, and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;like Niobovanadate Cage Built from {(Nb)V5} Pentagon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The striking aesthetic appeal of fullerene&#8208;like clusters has captured the interest of researchers. Nevertheless, the assembly of fullerene&#8208;like polyoxovadanadate (POV) cages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable pentagonal motif. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic POV cage, {(V2O)V30Nb12O102(H2O)12} (V30Nb12), by introducing Nb into the POVs. V30Nb12 is assembled by 12 heterometallic {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, reminiscent of C60. To our knowledge, the fullerene&#8208;like V30Nb12 not only represents the highest&#8208;nuclearity POV cage but also stands as the first niobovanadate cluster. Notably, V30Nb12 exhibits excellent solution stability, as confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS, FT&#8208;IR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. As there is no protection organic ligand on its outer surface, V30Nb12 can be further modified with Cu&#8208;complexes to form a fullerene&#8208;like cluster based zigzag chain (Cu&#8208;V30Nb12).</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Quenching of Hydrophobic Ag29 Nanoclusters Caused by Molecular Decoupling during Aqueous Phase Transfer and Emission Recovery through Supramolecular Recoupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting emissive hydrophobic nanoclusters for hydrophilic applications remains challenging due to the photoluminescence (PL) quenching with the phase transfer. In addition, the underlying mechanism of such a PL quenching remains a mystery. The present study elucidated the PL quenching mechanism by analyzing the atomically precise structures and optical properties of a surface&#8208;engineered Ag29 nanocluster with an all&#8208;around&#8208;carboxyl functionalized surface. Specifically, the phase transfer&#8208;triggered PL quenching was justified as the molecular decoupling, which directed an unfixed cluster surface and the weakened radiative transition. Furthermore, the emission recovery of the quenched nanoclusters was accomplished via a supramolecular recoupling approach through the GSH addition&#8208;induced aggregation of cluster molecules, wherein the restriction of intracluster motions and intercluster rotations strengthened the radiative transition of clusters. The findings in this work offer a new perspective on structure&#8208;emission correlations for atomically precise nanoclusters, hopefully shedding light on the fabrication of more highly emissive cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials aiming at downstream hydrophilic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Plasmon Enhanced Infrared Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IR spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;IR) is a cutting&#8208;edge operando method for exploring electrochemical reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Synthesis of Topological Gels by Penetrating Polymerization Using a Molecular Net</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints; ideally, no attractive intermolecular interactions act between their components, which yields interesting physical properties. However, most reported previous topological gels were synthesized based on supramolecular interlocked structures such as polyrotaxane, for which attractive intermolecular interactions are essential. Here, we synthesize a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure using poly(ethylene glycol). When a water&#8208;soluble monomer (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) is polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrates the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components. The MN gels show unique physical properties as well a significantly high degree of swelling and high extensibility due to slipping of the physical cross&#8208;linking. We postulate this method to yield a new paradigm in gel science with unprecedented physical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermediate Color Emission via Nanographenes with Organic&#160;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoluminescence (PL) color can be tuned by mixing fluorophores emitting the three primary colors in an appropriate ratio. When color tuning is achieved on a single substrate, we can simplify device structures. We demonstrated that nanographenes (NGs), which are graphene fragments with a size of tens of nanometers, could be utilized as carriers of fluorophores. The addition of red&#8208; and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting fluorophores on the edge successfully reproduced the purple light. The relative PL intensities of the fluorophores could be regulated by the excitation wavelength, enabling multicolor emission between blue and red light. Owing to the triphenylamine units of the fluorophores, the NGs showed PL enhancement due to aggregation. This characteristic was valuable for the fabrication of solid polymer materials. Specifically, the functionalized NGs can be dispersed into polyvinylidene difluoride. The resultant polymer films emitted red, blue, and purple color. Our study demonstrated the potential applicability of NGs for fluorophore carriers capable of reproducing intermediate colors of light.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrophobic Tri&#8208;layer Interface Rendered Mechanically Graded Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery is promising as grid scale energy storage device, but hindered by the instable electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, we report the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte for aqueous zinc metal batteries. The lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte creates the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface assembled by first two layers of hydrophobic OTF&#8208; and EMIM+ and third layer of loosely attached water, beyond the classical Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern theory based electrochemical double layer. By taking advantage of the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enables a wide electrochemical working window (2.93 V) with relatively high zinc ion conductivity (17.3 mS/cm). Furthermore, the anion crowding interface facilitates the OTF&#8208; decomposition chemistry to create the mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface layer to simultaneously suppress the dendrite formation and maintain the mechanical stability. In this way, the lean&#8208;water based ionic liquid electrolyte realizes the ultralong cyclability of over 10000 cycles at 20 A/g and at practical condition of N/P ratio of 1.5, the cumulated areal capacity reach 1.8 Ah/cm2, which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc metal battery performance. Our work highlights the importance of the stable electrode/electrolyte interface stability, which would be practical for building high energy grid scale zinc&#8208;ion battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Manipulating Molecular Packing via Tuning Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Topology Enabling High&#8208;Performance Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), the self&#8208;organization of organic semiconductors plays a crucial role. This study focuses on the precisely manipulation of molecular assemble via tuning alkyl side&#8208;chain topology in a series of low&#8208;cost nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Among the three NFREAs investigated, DPA&#8208;4, which possesses an asymmetric alkyl side&#8208;chain length, exhibits a tight packing in the crystal and high crystallinity in the film, contributing to improved electron mobility and favorable film morphology for DPA&#8208;4. As a result, the OSC device based on DPA&#8208;4 achieves an excellent power conversion efficiency of 16.67%, ranking among the highest efficiencies for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Light&#8208;Writable Orientation Control in Liquid Crystal Elastomer Film Enabled by Chalcones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with intrinsic anisotropy. However, it is still challenging to in&#8208;situ program the mesogen alignment to realize three&#8208;dimensional (3D) deformations with high&#8208;resolution patterned structures. This work presents a feasible strategy to program the anisotropy of LCEs by using chalcone mesogens that can undergo a photoinduced cycloaddition reaction under linear polarized light. It is shown that by controlling the polarization director and the irradiation region, patterned alignment distribution in a freestanding LCE film can be created, which leads to complex and reversible 3D shape&#8208;morphing behaviors. The work demonstrates an in&#8208;situ light&#8208;writing method to achieve sophisticated topography changes in LCEs, which has potential applications in encryption, sensors and other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Simultaneous Dense Zinc Deposition and Broken Side&#8208;Reaction Loops in the Zn//V2O5 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Zn//V2O5 system not only faces the incontrollable growth of zinc (Zn) dendrites, but also withstands the cross&#8208;talk effect of by&#8208;products produced from the cathode side to the Zn anode, inducing interelectrode talk and aggravating battery failure. To tackle these issues, we construct a rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) to achieve Zn deposition modulation and side reaction inhibition in Zn//V2O5 full cells. The polymer matrix and BN exhibit a robust anchoring effect on SO42&#8208;, accelerating Zn2+ migration and enabling dense Zn deposition behavior. Therefore, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells based on the R&#8208;ZSO electrolyte can operate stably for more than 1500 h, which is six times higher than that of cells employing the blank electrolyte. More importantly, the R&#8208;ZSO hydrogel electrolyte effectively decouples the cross&#8208;talk effects, thus breaking the infinite loop of side reactions. As a result, the Zn//V2O5 cells using this modified hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate stable operation over 1,000 cycles, with a capacity loss rate of only 0.028% per cycle. Our study provides a promising gel chemistry, which offers a valuable guide for the construction of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte by Multivalent Low&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Penalty Design for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiNO3 is a remarkable additive that can dramatically enhance the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at lithium metal anodes. However, it has long been constrained by its incompatibility with commercially used ester electrolytes. Herein, we correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility and proposed a new low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design that achieves high intrinsic LiNO3 solubility in ester solvents by employing multivalent linear esters. This strategy is conceptually different from the conventional enthalpic methods that relies on extrinsic high&#8208;polarity carriers. In this way, LiNO3 can directly interact with the primary ester solvents and fundamentally alters the electrolyte properties, resulting in substantial improvements in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high Columbic efficiency and cycling stability. This work illustrates the significance of regulating the solvation entropy for high&#8208;performance electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Donor/Acceptor Interfaces on Organic Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability Revealed through Theoretical Calculations and Morphology Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>End&#8208;groups halogenation strategies, generally refers to fluorination and chlorination, have been confirmed as simple and efficient methods to regulate the photoelectric performance of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), but a controversy over which one is better has existed for a long time. Here, two novel NFAs, C9N3&#8208;4F and C9N3&#8208;4Cl, featured with different end&#8208;groups were successfully synthesized and blended with two renowned donors, D18 and PM6, featured with different electron&#8208;withdrawing units. Detailed theoretical calculations and morphology characterizations of the interface structures indicate NFAs based on different end&#8208;groups possess different binding energy and miscibility with donors, which shows an obvious influence on phase&#8208;separation morphology, charge transport behavior and device performance. After verified by other three pairs of reported NFAs, a universal conclusion obtained as the devices based on D18 with fluorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs and PM6 with chlorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs generally show excellent efficiencies, high fill factors and stability. Finally, the devices based on D18: C9N3&#8208;4F and PM6: C9N34Cl yield outstanding efficiency of 18.53% and 18.00%, respectively. Suitably selecting donor and regulating donor/acceptor interface can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel NFAs, which points out the way for further molecular design and selection for high&#8208;performance and stable organic solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering tunable ratiometric dual emission in single emitter&#8208;based amorphous systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular emitters with multi&#8208;emissive properties are in high demand in numerous fields, while these properties basically depend on specific molecular conformation and packing. For amorphous systems, special molecular arrangement is unnecessary, but it remains challenging to achieve such luminescent behaviors. Herein, we present a general strategy that takes advantage of molecular rigidity and S1&#8211;T1 energy gap balance for emitter design, which enables fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emission properties in various solid forms, whether crystalline or amorphous. Subsequently, the amorphism of the emitters based polymethyl methacrylate films endowed an in situ regulation of the dual&#8208;emissive characteristics. With the ratiometric regulation of phosphorescence by external stimuli and stable fluorescence as internal reference, highly controllable luminescent color tuning (yellow to blue including white emission) was achieved. There properties together with a persistent luminous behavior is of benefit for an irreplaceable set of optical information combination, featuring an ultrahigh&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting ability. Our research introduces a concept of eliminating the crystal&#8208;form and molecular&#8208;conformational dependence of complex luminescent properties through emitter molecular design. This has profound implications for the development of functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Helical Covalent Inorganic Polymer: Preparation, Crystal Structure and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymer (CityU&#8208;10) has been successfully prepared. Its crystal structure shows that the same&#8208;handed helical chains form a pseudo&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional layer via multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Then, the left&#8208;handed layers and right&#8208;handed layers alternatively stack together to form a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structure.







Abstract
Helical morphologies are widely observed in nature, however, it is very challenging to prepare artificial helical polymers. Especially, precisely understanding the structure information of artificial metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymers via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis is rarely explored. Here, we successfully prepare a novel metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymer ({[Te(C6H5)2] [PO3(OH)]}n, named CityU&#8208;10) by introducing angular anions (HOPO32&#8722;) into traditional tellurium&#8208;oxygen chains. The dynamic reversibility of the reaction is realized through the introduction of organic tellurium precursor and the slow hydrolysis of polyphosphoric acid. High&#8208;quality and large&#8208;size single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 have been successfully characterized via SCXRD, where the same&#8208;handed helical inorganic polymer chains form a pseudo&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional layer via multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The left&#8208;handed layers and right&#8208;handed layers alternatively stack together through weak hydrogen bonds to form a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structure. The single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 are found to display promising optical properties with a large birefringence. Our results would offer new guidelines for designing and preparing new crystalline covalent polymers through tellurium&#8208;based chemistry.

         <title>Photochemical Deoxygenative Hydroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes Promoted by a Nucleophilic Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photochemical method for deoxygenative hydroalkylation of a wide range of alkenes and lactic acid derivatives is reported. This approach utilizes thiophenol as a nucleophilic organic catalyst which forms the key intermediate of this transformation via an SN2 process.







Abstract
The direct utilization of simple and abundant feedstocks in carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions to embellish sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is highly desirable. Herein, we report a novel photochemical deoxygenative hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with readily available carboxylic acid derivatives. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, accommodating carboxylic acid&#8208;, alcohol&#8208;, ester&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, amide&#8208;, silane&#8208;, and boronic ester groups, as well as nitrile&#8208;containing substrates. The reaction is operationally simple, mild, and water&#8208;tolerant, and can be carried out on multigram&#8208;scale, which highlights the utility of the method to prepare value&#8208;added compounds in a practical and scalable manner. The synthetic application of the developed method is further exemplified through the synthesis of suberanilic acid, a precursor of vorinostat, a drug used for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. A novel mechanistic approach was identified using thiol as a nucleophilic catalyst, which forms a key intermediate for this transformation. Furthermore, electrochemical studies, quantum yield, and mechanistic experiments were conducted to support a proposed catalytic cycle for the transformation.

         <title>The Diterpenoid Substrate Analogue 19&#8208;nor&#8208;GGPP Reveals Pronounced Methyl Group Effects in Diterpene Cyclisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19&#8208;nor&#8208;Geranylgeranyldiphosphate (with a methyl group removed) has been synthesised and converted into diterpene analogues with 20&#8197;diterpene synthases. In some cases only the desmethyl derivatives of the natural enzyme products were obtained, but with several enzymes a dramatic change in the reactivity was observed. The newly opened reaction paths to compounds with unknown skeletons reveal an intriguing methyl group effect in diterpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
The substrate analogue 19&#8208;nor&#8208;geranylgeranyl diphosphate (19&#8208;nor&#8208;GGPP) was synthesised and incubated with 20&#8197;diterpene synthases, resulting in the formation of diterpenoids in all cases. A total of 23&#8197;different compounds were isolated from these enzyme reactions and structurally characterised, if possible including the experimental determination of absolute configurations through a stereoselective deuteration approach. In several cases the missing 19&#8208;Me group in the substrate analogue resulted in opening of completely new reaction paths towards compounds with novel skeletons. DFT calculations were applied to gain a deeper understanding of these observed methyl group effects in diterpene biosynthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substrate analogue 19-&lt;i&gt;nor&lt;/i&gt;-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (19-&lt;i&gt;nor&lt;/i&gt;-GGPP) was synthesised and incubated with 20&#8197;diterpene synthases, resulting in the formation of diterpenoids in all cases. A total of 23&#8197;different compounds were isolated from these enzyme reactions and structurally characterised, if possible including the experimental determination of absolute configurations through a stereoselective deuteration approach. In several cases the missing 19-Me group in the substrate analogue resulted in opening of completely new reaction paths towards compounds with novel skeletons. DFT calculations were applied to gain a deeper understanding of these observed methyl group effects in diterpene biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decarboxylative Radical Sulfilimination via Photoredox, Copper, and Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the protocol for decarboxylative radical sulfilimination reactions between sulfenamides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids, which were achieved via a combination of photoredox, copper, and Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The mild, operationally simple reaction has good functional group compatibility. Our findings provide a Br&#248;nsted base activation strategy for metallaphotoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Sulfilimines, the aza&#8208;variants of sulfoxides, are key structural motifs in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals; and sulfilimine synthesis is therefore important in organic chemistry. However, methods for radical sulfilimination remain elusive, and as a result, the structural diversity of currently available sulfilimines is limited. Herein, we report the first protocol for decarboxylative radical sulfilimination reactions between sulfenamides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids, which were achieved via a combination of photoredox, copper, and Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. This novel protocol provided a wide variety of sulfilimines, in addition to serving as an efficient route for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl/S&#8208;aryl homocysteine sulfilimines and S&#8208;(4&#8208;methylphenyl) homocysteine sulfoximine. Moreover, it could be used for late&#8208;stage introduction of a sulfilimine group into structurally complex molecules, thereby avoiding the need to preserve labile organosulfur moieties through multistep synthetic sequences. A mechanism involving photocatalytic substrate transformation and copper&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond formation is proposed.

         <title>A Systematic Investigation of Proteoforms with N&#8208;Terminal Glycine and Their Dynamics Reveals Its Impacts on Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic method based on sortase A catalyzed ligation was developed to characterize proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine in human cells and quantify their dynamics. Around 2000 proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were identified, and most of them were previously unknown. Bioinformatic analyses reveal proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations.







Abstract
The N&#8208;termini of proteins can regulate their degradation, and the same protein with different N&#8208;termini may have distinct dynamics. Recently, it was found that N&#8208;terminal glycine can serve as a degron recognized by two E3 ligases, but N&#8208;terminal glycine was also reported to stabilize proteins. Here we developed a chemoenzymatic method for selective enrichment of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine and integrated dual protease cleavage to further improve the enrichment specificity. Over 2000 unique peptides with protein N&#8208;terminal glycine were analyzed from &gt;1000 proteins, and most of them are previously unknown, indicating the effectiveness of the current method to capture low&#8208;abundance proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine. The degradation rates of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were quantified along with those of proteins from the whole proteome. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations. Membrane proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine and proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine from the N&#8208;terminal methionine excision degrade more rapidly. Furthermore, the secondary structures, adjacent amino acid residues, and protease specificities for N&#8208;terminal glycine are also vital for protein degradation. The results advance our understanding of the effects of N&#8208;terminal glycine on protein properties and functions.

We report examples of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;S, and C(sp2)&#8722;P bond formations in water microdroplets at room temperature and without catalyst.







Abstract
We report examples of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;S, and C(sp2)&#8722;P bond&#8208;forming transformations in water microdroplets at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using N2 as a nebulizing gas. When an aqueous solution of vinylic acid and amine is electrosprayed (+3&#8197;kV), the corresponding C(sp2)&#8722;N product is formed in a single step, which was characterized using mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS2). The scope of this reaction was extended to other amines and other unsaturated acids, including acrylic (CH2=CHCOOH) and crotonic (CH3CH=CHCOOH) acids. We also found that thiols and phosphines are viable nucleophiles, and the corresponding C(sp2)&#8722;S and C(sp2)&#8722;P products are observed in positive ion mode using MS and MS2.

Novel fused dyads and triads of NiII&#8208;porphyrin, PdII NC&#8208;corrole, and PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin were synthesized by post&#8208;fabrication of NiII porphyrins. In these fused oligomers, PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin is aromatic and PdII NC&#8208;corrole is moderately antiaromatic. These local electronic properties interact to influence the overall electronic networks in the hybrids.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;sharing fused hybrids of NiII porphyrin with PdII N&#8208;confused(NC)&#8208;corrole and PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin were synthesized by post&#8208;fabrication of NiII porphyrins. Specifically this consists of Friedel&#8211;Crafts type aromatic substitution reaction of meso&#8208;free NiII porphyrin with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dibromotripyrrin and Pd(OAc)2 assisted cyclization, and final heating to induce a Pd&#8722;C bond formation. NiII porphyrins fused with PdII NC&#8208;corrole and with PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrins show coplanar structures with a shared pyrrole unit. In these hybrids, the PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin is aromatic and the PdII NC&#8208;corrole is moderately antiaromatic and these local electronic properties interact to influence the whole network.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Generation of Tertiary Anions from Primary Amines via a Radical Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deaminative radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy generating carbanions is reported. This so called &#8220;aza&#8208;Reformatsky&#8221; reaction leverages the use of redox&#8208;active imines and an iridium photocatalyst to generate a wide array of tertiary benzylic, heteroarylbenzylic and &#945;&#8208;ester anions, which can be trapped with different electrophiles.







Abstract
A method for the generation of tertiary carbanions via a deaminative radical&#8208;polar crossover is reported using redox active imines from &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines. A variety of benzylic amines and amino esters can be used in this approach, with the latter engaging in a novel &#8220;aza&#8208;Reformatsky&#8221; reaction.

     alt="Photoredox-Catalyzed Generation of Tertiary Anions from Primary Amines via a Radical Polar Crossover"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deaminative radical-polar crossover strategy generating carbanions is reported. This so called &#8220;aza-Reformatsky&#8221; reaction leverages the use of redox-active imines and an iridium photocatalyst to generate a wide array of tertiary benzylic, heteroarylbenzylic and &#945;-ester anions, which can be trapped with different electrophiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method for the generation of tertiary carbanions via a deaminative radical-polar crossover is reported using redox active imines from &#945;-tertiary primary amines. A variety of benzylic amines and amino esters can be used in this approach, with the latter engaging in a novel &#8220;aza-Reformatsky&#8221; reaction. Electronic trends correlate the stability of the resulting carbanion with reaction efficiency. The anions can be trapped with different electrophiles including aldehydes, ketones, imines, Michael acceptors, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Selective anion formation can be achieved in the presence of another equivalent or more acidic C&#8722;H bond in both an inter- and intramolecular fashion. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a discrete carbanion intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly for Control over Helical Nanostructures and Topochemical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathway&#8208;dependent supramolecular assemblies from a rationally designed glutamide derivative were found, which formed distinct chiral nanotwist and nanotube depending on the cooling rate. Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly showed also the ability to control over the guest molecules with emergent blue or green circularly polarized luminescence and topochemical polymerization.







Abstract
Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly, in which a single building block forms two or more types of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures, is an important topic due to its mimic to the complexity in biology and manipulation of diverse supramolecular materials. Here, we report a pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly using chiral glutamide derivatives (L or D&#8208;PAG), which form chiral nanotwist and nanotube through a cooperative slow cooling and an isodesmic fast cooling process, respectively. Furthermore, pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly can be harnessed to control over the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of PAG with a luminophore &#946;&#8208;DCS or a photopolymerizable PCDA. Fast cooling leads to the co&#8208;assembled PAG/&#946;&#8208;DCS nanotube exhibiting green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), while slow cooling to nanofiber with blue CPL. Additionally, fast cooling process promotes the photopolymerization of PCDA into a red chiral polymer, whereas slow cooling inhibits the polymerization. This work not only demonstrates the pathway&#8208;dependent control over structural characteristics but also highlights the diverse functions emerged from the different assemblies.

         <title>Accessing Pyridines via a Nitrene Internalization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assessing pyridines by directly and selectively replacing a C&#8208;atom from aromatic ring systems with a nitrogen remains underexplored, while also being crucial for nitrogen scans in drug discovery processes. In this direction, a recent contribution by Levin's group involving the one&#8208;pot nitrene internalization reaction for ipso&#8208;selective C&#8208;to&#8208;N transmutation provides a direct access to pyridyl isomers.







Abstract
Pyridines are valuable pharmacophores, and their access via direct and selective transmutation of carbon atom with desired nitrogen could become crucial in drug discovery processes. However, only scarce examples can be found when it comes C&#8208;to&#8208;N&#8208;transmutation reactions of aromatics that could lead to the facile synthesis of pyridines or other azaarenes. In this context, Levin and co&#8208;workers recently disclosed a process leading to pyridines from the corresponding aryl azides via the regioselective nitrene internalization process. Notably, the transformation did not lead to any further modification of the rest of the aromatic skeleton. This innovative work enabled selectively accessing various pyridine derivatives through direct nitrogen scan operations on benzene derivatives, which were otherwise not feasible.

         <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Mechanism in Aqueous Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpointed the cause of the capacity degradation of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries and established the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. Such a methodology circumvents the complicated characterization methods used in previous studies and provides a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of other aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries have attracted extensive attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications, however, the energy storage chemistry of MnO2 in mild acidic aqueous electrolytes remains elusive and controversial. Using &#945;&#8208;MnO2 as a case study, we developed a methodology by coupling conventional coin batteries with customized beaker batteries to pinpoint the operating mechanism of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries. This approach visually simulates the operating state of batteries in different scenarios and allows for a comprehensive study of the operating mechanism of aqueous Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries under mild acidic conditions. It is validated that the electrochemical performance can be modulated by controlling the addition of Mn2+ to the electrolyte. The method is utilized to systematically eliminate the possibility of Zn2+ and/or H+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation reactions, thereby confirming the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. By combining a series of phase and spectroscopic characterizations, the compositional, morphological and structural evolution of electrodes and electrolytes during battery cycling is probed, elucidating the intrinsic battery chemistry of MnO2 in mild acid electrolytes. Such a methodology developed can be extended to other energy storage systems, providing a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries as well.

         <title>Crystalline Dual&#8208;Porous Covalent Triazine Frameworks as a New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline dual&#8208;porous pyridine&#8208;based CTF with in situ generated Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom active sites has been synthesized for the first time. Benefiting from the unique structure of Fe&#8208;N3 and the dynamic reversible microenvironment of metal active centers, few&#8208;layer Fe&#8208;CTF nanosheets exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic and Zn&#8208;air battery performance.







Abstract
Crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have gained considerable interest in energy and catalysis owing to their well&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated porosity and superior physicochemical properties, however, suffer from very limited molecular structures. Herein we report a novel solvent&#8208;free FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of 2, 6&#8208;pyridinedicarbonitrile (DCP) to achieve the first synthesis of crystalline, dual&#8208;porous, pyridine&#8208;based CTF (Fe&#8208;CTF). The FeCl3 could not only act as a highly active Lewis acid catalyst for promoting the two&#8208;dimensional ordered polymerization of DCP monomers, but also in situ coordinate with the tridentate chelators generated between pyridine and triazine groups to yield unique Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom active sites in Fe&#8208;CTF. Abundant few&#8208;layer crystalline nanosheets (Fe&#8208;CTF NSs) could be prepared through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered Fe&#8208;CTF and exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential and onset potential up to 0.902 and 1.02&#8197;V respectively, and extraordinary Zn&#8208;air battery performance with an ultrahigh specific capacity and power density of 811&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 230&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. By combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we revealed a dynamic and reversible evolution of Fe&#8208;N3 to Fe&#8208;N2 during the electrocatalytic process, which could further accelerate the electrocatalytic reaction.

         <title>Aqueous Electroreduction of Nitric Oxide to Ammonia at Low Concentration via Vacancy Engineered FeOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cl vacancy strategy results in a lower Fe oxidation state with sharp d&#8208;states characteristics to enhance the adsorption and activation of NO, which overcomes the sluggish kinetics of NORR and competitive HER over FeOCl&#8208;VCl, especially at low concentrations of NO, and improves the catalytic activity and selectivity towards NORR.







Abstract
Electroreduction of nitric oxide (NO) to NH3 (NORR) has gained extensive attention for the sake of low carbon emission and air pollutant treatment. Unfortunately, NORR is greatly hindered by its sluggish kinetics, especially under low concentrations of NO. Herein, we developed a chlorine (Cl) vacancy strategy to overcome this limitation over FeOCl nanosheets (FeOCl&#8208;VCl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Cl vacancy resulted in defective Fe with sharp d&#8208;states characteristics in FeOCl&#8208;VCl to enhance the absorption and activation of NO. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) and attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR) verified the lower average oxidation state of defective Fe to enhance the electron transfer for NO adsorption/activation and facilitate the generation of key NHO and NHx intermediates. As a result, the FeOCl&#8208;VCl exhibited superior NORR activities with the NH3 Faradaic efficiency up to 91.1&#8201;% while maintaining a high NH3 yield rate of 455.4&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;vol&#8201;% NO concentration, competitive with those of previously reported literatures under higher NO concentration. Further, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery utilizing FeOCl&#8208;VCl as cathode delivered a record peak power density of 6.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, offering a new route for simultaneous NO removal, NH3 production, and energy supply.

&lt;p&gt;A Cl vacancy strategy results in a lower Fe oxidation state with sharp d-states characteristics to enhance the adsorption and activation of NO, which overcomes the sluggish kinetics of NORR and competitive HER over FeOCl-V&lt;sub&gt;Cl&lt;/sub&gt;, especially at low concentrations of NO, and improves the catalytic activity and selectivity towards NORR.

         <title>Friedel&#8211;Crafts Acylation for Accessing Multi&#8208;Bridge&#8208;Functionalized Large Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different lateral functionalized pillar[n]arenes can be obtained using Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation. The irreversible nature of acylation results in the macrocycles being obtained selectively in terms of ring sizes and functional positions. Further derivatization of the ketones is also possible to afford various laterally modified pillar[n]arenes that cannot be accessed by general Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions.







Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes can be constructed using a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation process. However, due to the reversible nature of the alkylation, mixture of large pillar[n]arenes (n&#8805;7) are obtained as minor products, and thus laborious purification are necessary to isolate the larger pillar[n]arenes. Moreover, inert methylene bridges are introduced during the alkylation process, and the multi&#8208;functionalization of the bridges has never been investigated. Herein, an irreversible Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation is used to prepare pillar[n]arenes. Due to the irreversible nature of the acylation, the reaction of precursors bearing carboxylic acids and electron&#8208;rich arene rings results in a size&#8208;exclusive formation of pillar[n]arenes, in which the ring&#8208;size is determined by the precursor length. Because of this size&#8208;selective formation, laborious separation of undesired macrocycles is not necessary. Moreover, the bridges of pillar[n]arenes are selectively installed with reactive carbonyl groups using the acylation method, whose positions are determined by the precursor used. The carbonyl bridges can be easily converted into versatile functional groups, leading to various laterally modified pillar[n]arenes, which cannot be accessed by the alkylation strategy.

         <title>Manipulated Fluoro&#8208;Ether Derived Nucleophilic Decomposition Products for Mitigating Polarization&#8208;Induced Capacity Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior crosslinked products derived from HFE decomposition via nucleophilic O species attack serve as valuable sutures. They prevent fragmented substances from escaping CEI construction, providing an excellent foundation for the homogeneous deposition of LiF related species. Consequently, an effective CEI with both rigidity and flexibility is established, which reduces cell polarization, achieves long&#8208;lasting electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is a fascinating choice to improve the performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes (LRLO) for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, many existing electrolyte designs and adjustment principles tend to overlook the unique challenges posed by LRLO, particularly the nucleophilic attack. Here, we introduce an electrolyte modification by locally replacing carbonate solvents in traditional electrolytes with a fluoro&#8208;ether. By benefit of the decomposition of fluoro&#8208;ether under nucleophilic O&#8208;related attacks, which delivers an excellent passivation layer with LiF and polymers, possessing rigidity and flexibility on the LRLO surface. More importantly, the fluoro&#8208;ether acts as &#8220;sutures&#8221;, ensuring the integrity and stability of both interfacial and bulk structures, which contributed to suppressing severe polarization and enhancing the cycling capacity retention from 39&#8201;% to 78&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles for the 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class LRLO. This key electrolyte strategy with comprehensive analysis, provides new insights into addressing nucleophilic challenge for high&#8208;energy anionic redox related cathode systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral perovskites possess a huge applicative potential in several areas of optoelectronics and spintronics. The development of novel lead&#8208;free perovskites with tunable properties is a key topic of current research. Herein, we report a novel lead&#8208;free chiral perovskite, namely (R/S&#8208;)ClMBA2SnI4 (ClMBA = 1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanamine) and the corresponding racemic system. ClMBA2SnI4 samples exhibit a low band gap (2.12 eV) together with broad emission extending in the red region of the spectrum (&#8764;1.7 eV). Chirality transfer from the organic ligand induces chiroptical activity in the 465&#8208;530 nm range. Density function theory calculations show a Rashba type band splitting for the chiral samples and no band splitting for the racemic isomer. Self&#8208;trapped exciton formation is at the origin of the large Stokes shift in the emission. Careful correlation with analogous lead and lead&#8208;free 2D chiral perovskites confirms the role of the symmetry&#8208;breaking distortions in the inorganic layers associated with the ligands as the source of the observed chiroptical properties providing also preliminary structure&#8208;property correlation in 2D chiral perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton Reaction Mediated by Atomically Dispersed Ag&#8211;Co Photocatalysts toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving the complete mineralization of persistent pollutants in wastewater is still a big challenge. Here, we propose an efficient photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for the degradation of different pollutants using the high&#8208;density (Ag: 22 wt%) of atomically dispersed AgCo dual sites embedded in graphic carbon nitride (AgCo&#8208;CN). Comprehensive experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ag and Co dual sites in AgCo&#8208;CN play a critical role in accelerating the photoinduced charge separation and forming the self&#8208;Fenton redox centers, respectively. The bimetallic AgCo&#8208;CN exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance toward the phenol even under extreme conditions due to an efficient degradation pathway and in&#8208;situ generation of the hydrogen peroxide producing the main active oxygen species (&#183;OH and 1O2) and showed long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;design photo&#8208;Filter reactor for the purification of the phenol. Our discoveries pave the way for the design of efficient single&#8208;atoms photocatalysts&#8208;based photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for recalcitrant pollutant treatment.</dc:description>

Here, we propose an efficient photo-self-Fenton reaction for the degradation of different pollutants using the high-density (Ag: 22 wt%) of atomically dispersed AgCo dual sites embedded in graphic carbon nitride (AgCo-CN). Comprehensive experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ag and Co dual sites in AgCo-CN play a critical role in accelerating the photoinduced charge separation and forming the self-Fenton redox centers, respectively. The bimetallic AgCo-CN exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance toward the phenol even under extreme conditions due to an efficient degradation pathway and in-situ generation of the hydrogen peroxide producing the main active oxygen species (&#183;OH and 1O2) and showed long-term activity in a self-design photo-Filter reactor for the purification of the phenol. Our discoveries pave the way for the design of efficient single-atoms photocatalysts-based photo-self-Fenton reaction for recalcitrant pollutant treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Above&#8208;Tg Annealing Benefits in Nanoparticle&#8208;Stabilized Carbon Molecular Sieve Membrane Pyrolysis for Improved Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles can suppress asymmetric precursor support collapse during pyrolysis to create carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes. This advance allows elimination of standard sol&#8211;gel support stabilization steps. Here we report a simple but surprisingly important thermal soaking step at 400 &#176;C in the pyrolysis process to obtain high performance CMS membranes. The composite CMS membranes show CO2/CH4 (50:50) mixed gas feed with an attractive CO2/CH4 selectivity of 134.2 and CO2 permeance of 71 GPU at 35&#8239;&#176;C. Furthermore, a H2/CH4 selectivity of 663 with H2 permeance of 240 GPU was achieved for promising green energy resource&#8208;H2 separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Carboamination of Aminodienes to N&#8208;Heterocycles via C&#8722;N Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic transformation of ubiquitous but inert C&#8208;N bonds is highly appealing in synthetic chemistry, but the efficient cleaving inert C&#8208;N bond and simultaneous incorporation of both the cleaved C&#8208;moiety and N&#8208;moiety into the desired products has been a long&#8208;standing formidable challenge so far. Here, we developed a radical&#8208;addition triggered cyclization and C&#8208;N bond cleavage process enabled by the unique I2/Ni or benzyl halide/Ni&#8208;catalytic system, allowing the formal insertion of diene into the inert C&#8208;N bond. This reaction features high atom economy and enables an expedient annulative carboamination of aminodienes to diverse pyrrolidines, piperidines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the reaction is initiated via the generation of a benzyl radical and the formation of quaternary ammonium salt is key for the C&#8208;N bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Helical Fibres from Chiral Phenylacetylene Monomers: Cation Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral metallo&#8208;supramolecular fibres can be easily obtained by mixing a chloroform solution of a phenylacetylene monomer (PA) that bears a chiral sulfoxide group as pendant, with different equivalents of a methanolic solution of AgClO4. Thus, while the PA is found molecularly dissolved in chloroform, the addition of Ag+ ions induce its aggregation through the formation of an axially chiral metallo&#8208;supramolecular aggregate with high thermal stable properties. In this case, the ability of the metal ion to coordinate the PA triple bond, combined with the argentophilicity of the metal ion and the planarity of the phenylacetylene drives to the formation of a helical coordination polymer, whose P or M axial chirality is determined by the chirality of the sulfoxide used as substituent of the PA. Depending on the PA/Ag+ (mol/mol) ratio, it is possible to tune the morphology of the metallo&#8208;supramolecular aggregate from chiral fibers to chiral gel.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double&#8208;ligand Chelating Strategy to Iron Complex Anolytes with Ultrahigh Cyclability for Aqueous Iron Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous all&#8208;iron flow batteries (AIFBs) are attractive for large&#8208;scale and long&#8208;term energy storage due to their extremely low cost and safety features. To accelerate commercial application, a long cyclable and reversible iron anolyte is expected to address the critical barriers, namely iron dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a robust iron complex with triethanolamine (TEA) and 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MM) double ligands. By introducing two ligands into one iron center, the binding energy of the complex increases, making it more stable in the charge&#8208;discharge reactions. The Fe(TEA)MM complex achieves reversible and stable redox between Fe3+ and Fe2+, without metallic iron growth and HER. AIFBs based on this anolyte perform a high energy efficiency of 80.5% at 80 mA cm&#8208;2 and exhibit a record durability among reported AIFBs. The efficiency and capacity retain nearly 100% after 1,400 cycles. The capital cost of this AIFB is $33.2 kWh&#8208;1 (e.g., 20 h duration), cheaper than Li&#8208;ion battery and vanadium flow battery. This double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy not only solves the current problems faced by AIFBs, but also provides an insight for further improving the cycling stability of other flow batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Cu(111) as Superior Active Sites for Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3 with High Single&#8208;Pass Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opting for NO as an N source in electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis presents an intriguing approach to tackle energy and environmental challenges. However, blindly pursuing high NH3 synthesis rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE) while ignoring the NO conversion ratio could result in environmental problems. Herein, Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) surface is fabricated and exhibit a NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 yield rate of 371.89 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 (flow cell) and the highest FE of 93.19&#177;1.99% (H&#8208;type cell). The NO conversion ratio is increased to the current highest value of 63.74% combined with the development of the flow cell. Additionally, Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) clearly reveals that the "&#963;&#8208;&#960;* acceptance&#8208;donation" is the essence of the interaction between the Cu and NO as also supported by operando attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IRAS) in observing the key intermediate of NO&#8208;. This work not only achieves a milestone NO conversion ratio for electrocatalytic NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3, but also proposes a new descriptor that utilizes orbital hybridization between molecules and metal centers to accurately identify the real active sites of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Coordination Structure Regulation in Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc&#8208;based batteries are finding their niche in energy storage applications where cost, safety, scalability matter, yet they are plagued by rapid performance degradation due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to stabilize Zn anode. Herein, we report a competitive coordination structure to form unique quaternary hydrated eutectic electrolyte with ligand&#8208;cation&#8208;anion cluster. Unraveled by experiment and calculation results, the competing component can enter initial primary coordination shell of Zn2+ ion, partially substituting Lewis basic eutectic ligands and reinforcing cation&#8208;anion interaction. The hydration&#8208;deficient complexes induced between competing eutectic as hydrogen bond donor&#8208;accepter and water also broaden the electrochemical window and confine free water activity. The altered coordination further leads to robust hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic enriched solid electrolyte interphase, enabling passivated surface and suppressed dendrite growth. Noticeably, stable Zn plating/stripping for 8000&#8197;cycles with high Coulombic efficiencies of 99.6% and long cycling life of 10000 cycles for Zn&#8208;organic batteries are obtained. Even under harsh conditions (small N/P ratio, low temperature), the profits brought by the competitive eutectic electrolyte are still very prominent. This design principle leveraged by eutectic electrolytes with competitive coordination offers a new approach to improve battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction to Formate or CO with High Selectivity over a Covalent Organic Framework Covalently Anchored on Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 to HCOO&#8722; or CO can be significantly enhanced by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely studied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, pristine COFs usually exhibit low catalytic efficiency owing to the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this study, we fabricated a stable COF&#8208;based composite (GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co) by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Interestingly, in absolute acetonitrile (CH3CN), GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co shows a high selectivity of 94.4&#8201;% for the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, with a formate yield of 15.8&#8197;mmol/g, which is approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. By contrast, in CH3CN/H2O (v&#8201;:&#8201;v=4&#8201;:&#8201;1), the main product for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction over GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co is CO (96.1&#8201;%), with a CO yield as high as 52.2&#8197;mmol/g, which is also approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. Photoelectrochemical experiments demonstrate the covalent bonding of COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and GO to form the GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co composite facilitates charge separation and transfer significantly, thereby accounting for the enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, theoretical calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal H2O can stabilize the *COOH intermediate to further form a *CO intermediate via O&#8722;H(aq)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(*COOH) hydrogen bonding, thus explaining the regulated photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Weak Solvation Effect Induced Optimal Interfacial Chemistry Enables Highly Durable Zn Anodes for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte with weakly solvation effect is rationally developed for aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs). Benefiting from the reduced solvated H2O, boosted desolvation kinetics and in situ formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, Zn anode cycled in this electrolyte can deliver enhanced cycling stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as one of the most reliable energy storage technologies for scale&#8208;up applications, but still suffer from the instability of Zn anode, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new aqueous electrolyte with weak solvation effect by introducing low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant acetone to achieve H2O&#8208;poor solvation structure of Zn2+. Experimental and theoretical calculation studies concurrently reveal that such solvation structure can: i)&#8197;relieve the solvated H2O related side reactions, ii)&#8197;suppress the dendrite growth by boosting the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+ and iii)&#8197;in situ form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to synergistically inhibit the side reaction and dendrite growth. The synergy of these three factors prolongs the cycling life of Cu/Zn asymmetric cell from 30&#8197;h to more than 800&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and can work at more harsh condition of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More encouragingly, Zn/V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O full cell also shows enhanced cycling stability of 95.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles, much better than that with baseline electrolyte (failing at &#8776;700th&#8197;cycle).

         <title>Disproportionation of Co2+ in the Topochemically Reduced Oxide LaSrCoRuO5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reduction of LaSrCoRuO6 yields LaSrCoRuO5 a phase containing Co3+O6, Co1+O4 and Ru3+O5 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry&#8208;driven disproportionation of Co2+ in an extended oxide.







Abstract
Complex transition&#8208;metal oxides exhibit a wide variety of chemical and physical properties which are a strong function the local electronic states of the transition&#8208;metal centres, as determined by a combination of metal oxidation state and local coordination environment. Topochemical reduction of the double perovskite oxide, LaSrCoRuO6, using Zr, yields LaSrCoRuO5. This reduced phase contains an ordered array of apex&#8208;linked square&#8208;based pyramidal Ru3+O5, square&#8208;planar Co1+O4 and octahedral Co3+O6 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of Co2+. Coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of d7 transition&#8208;metal cations (e.g. Rh2+, Pd3+, Pt3+) is common in complex oxides containing 4d and 5d metals. However, the weak ligand field experienced by a 3d transition&#8208;metal such as cobalt leads to the expectation that d7+ Co2+ should be stable to disproportionation in oxide environments, so the presence of Co1+O4 and Co3+O6 units in LaSrCoRuO5 is surprising. Low&#8208;temperature measurements indicate LaSrCoRuO5 adopts a ferromagnetically ordered state below 120&#8197;K due to couplings between S=1/2 Ru3+ and S=1 Co1+.

         <title>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) Method for the Detection of Water Cycling across Cellular Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) method to image and quantify in vivo water cycling across cell membranes is reported. Parametric MRI&#8208;maps can be obtained that report, for each voxel, the degree of water permeability across cells. Cell membrane water permeability is a biomarker of cancer aggressiveness and can be used to monitor chemotherapy, as demonstrated in murine models of breast cancers.







Abstract
Water cycling across the membrane transporters is considered a hallmark of cellular metabolism and it could be of high diagnostic relevance in the characterization of tumors and other diseases. The method relies on the response of intracellular proton exchanging molecules to the presence of extracellular Gd&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs). Paramagnetic GBCAs enhances the relaxation rate of water molecules in the extracellular compartment and, through membrane exchange, the relaxation enhancement is transferred to intracellular molecules. The effect is detected at the MRI&#8208;CEST (Magnetic Resonance Imaging &#8208; Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) signal of intracellular proton exchanging molecules. The magnitude of the change in the CEST response reports on water cycling across the membrane. The method has been tested on Red Blood Cells and on orthotopic murine models of breast cancer with different degree of malignancy (4T1, TS/A and 168FARN). The distribution of voxels reporting on membrane permeability fits well with the cells&#8217; aggressiveness and acts as an early reporter to monitor therapeutic treatments.

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Understanding London Dispersion Interactions in Molecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has by now been realized that London dispersion (LD) interactions, the main contributor to the attractive part of the van der Waals potential, are ubiquitously present and need to be taken into consideration in structures and dynamics of chemical reactions. This review highlights recent experimental and theoretical advances in utilizing LD interactions as a design element.







Abstract
London dispersion (LD) interactions are the main contribution of the attractive part of the van der Waals potential. Even though LD effects are the driving force for molecular aggregation and recognition, the role of these omnipresent interactions in structure and reactivity had been largely underappreciated over decades. However, in the recent years considerable efforts have been made to thoroughly study LD interactions and their potential as a chemical design element for structures and catalysis. This was made possible through a fruitful interplay of theory and experiment. This review highlights recent results and advances in utilizing LD interactions as a structural motif to understand and utilize intra&#8208; and intermolecularly LD&#8208;stabilized systems. Additionally, we focus on the quantification of LD interactions and their fundamental role in chemical reactions.

         <title>Shearing Liquid&#8208;Crystalline MXene into Lamellar Membranes with Super&#8208;Aligned Nanochannels for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned nanochannels by applying shear forces to liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene nanosheet dispersion. The as&#8208;prepared LC MXene membrane (LCMM) shows excellent in&#8208;plane stacking order and precise interlayer spacing of &#8776;6&#8197;&#197;, demonstrating ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59, respectively), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes are crucial in various chemical and physiological processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated progress in separating monovalent/multivalent ions, but efficient monovalent/monovalent ion sieving remains a great challenge due to their same valence and similar radii. Here, this work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned slit&#8208;shaped nanochannels with ultrahigh monovalent ion selectivity. The MXene membrane is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene dispersion, which is conducive to the highly&#8208;ordered stacking of the MXene nanosheets. The obtained LC MXene membrane (LCMM) exhibits ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ separation (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59), combined with a fast Li+ transport with a permeation rate of &#8776;0.35&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Theoretical calculations indicate that in MXene nanochannels, the hydrated Li+ with a tetrahedral shape has the smallest diameter among the monovalent ions, contributing to the highest mobility. Besides, the weakest interaction is found between hydrated Li+ and MXene channels which also contributes to the ultrafast permeation of Li+ through the super&#8208;aligned MXene channels. This work demonstrates the capability of MXene membranes in monovalent ion separation, which also provides a facile and general strategy to fabricate lamellar membranes in a large scale.

         <title>Anion Sensing through Redox&#8208;Modulated Fluorescent Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding Hosts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemical anion sensing is introduced as a powerful method to enable anion detection via simultaneous emission and voltammetry readouts. The combined advantages of both approaches facilitate anion sensing at very low sensor concentrations and in a competitive solvent system using a redox&#8208;active ferrocene&#8208;containing BODIPY anion receptor, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PET) modulates fluorescence emission.







Abstract
Anion sensing via either optical or electrochemical readouts has separately received enormous attention, however, a judicious combination of the advantages of both modalities remains unexplored. Toward this goal, we herein disclose a series of novel, redox&#8208;active, fluorescent, halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) BODIPY&#8208;based anion sensors, wherein the introduction of a ferrocene motif induces remarkable changes in the fluorescence response. Extensive fluorescence anion titration, lifetime and electrochemical studies reveal anion binding&#8208;induced emission modulation through intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET), the magnitude of which is dependent on the nature of both the XB/HB donor and anion. Impressively, the XB sensor outperformed its HB congener in terms of anion binding strength and fluorescence switching magnitude, displaying significant fluorescence turn&#8208;OFF upon anion binding. In contrast, redox&#8208;inactive control receptors display a turn&#8208;ON response, highlighting the pronounced impact of the introduction of the redox&#8208;active ferrocene on the optical sensing performance. Additionally, the redox&#8208;active ferrocene motif also serves as an electrochemical reporter group, enabling voltammetric anion sensing in competitive solvents. The combined advantages of both sensing modalities were further exploited in a novel, proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, fluorescence spectroelectrochemical anion sensing approach, enabling simultaneous and sensitive read out of optical and electrochemical responses in multiple oxidation states and at very low receptor concentration.

&lt;p&gt;Anion sensing via either optical or electrochemical readouts has separately received enormous attention, however, a judicious combination of the advantages of both modalities remains unexplored. Toward this goal, we herein disclose a series of novel, redox-active, fluorescent, halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) BODIPY-based anion sensors, wherein the introduction of a ferrocene motif induces remarkable changes in the fluorescence response. Extensive fluorescence anion titration, lifetime and electrochemical studies reveal anion binding-induced emission modulation through intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET), the magnitude of which is dependent on the nature of both the XB/HB donor and anion. Impressively, the XB sensor outperformed its HB congener in terms of anion binding strength and fluorescence switching magnitude, displaying significant fluorescence turn-OFF upon anion binding. In contrast, redox-inactive control receptors display a turn-ON response, highlighting the pronounced impact of the introduction of the redox-active ferrocene on the optical sensing performance. Additionally, the redox-active ferrocene motif also serves as an electrochemical reporter group, enabling voltammetric anion sensing in competitive solvents. The combined advantages of both sensing modalities were further exploited in a novel, proof-of-principle, fluorescence spectroelectrochemical anion sensing approach, enabling simultaneous and sensitive read out of optical and electrochemical responses in multiple oxidation states and at very low receptor concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binary Atomic Sites Enable a Confined Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalytic Sulfur Conversion for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated. And the catalytic matrix facilitated confined tandem electrocatalysis effects render the successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediators and mitigate the cathodic passivation within the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane architectured solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
The broader implementation of current all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries is still plagued by high operation temperature and inefficient sulfur utilization. And the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway along with the sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics further compromise the theoretical potentials of Na&#8722;S chemistry. Herein, we report a confined bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis effect to tune polysulfide electrochemistry in a novel low&#8208;temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C) all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S battery that utilizes Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane as a platform. The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated using a sacrificial template process. Upon discharge, CoN4 sites activate sulfur species and catalyze long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while MnN4 centers substantially accelerate the low&#8208;kinetic Na2S4 to Na2S directly conversion, manipulating the uniform deposition of electroactive Na2S and avoiding the formation of irreversible products (e.g., Na2S2). The intrinsic synergy of two catalytic centers benefits the Na2S decomposition and minimizes its activation barrier during battery recharging and then efficiently mitigate the cathodic passivation. As a result, the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cell delivers an attractive reversible capacity of 1060&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high CE of 98.5&#8201;% and a high energy of 1008&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode&#8722;1, comparable to the liquid electrolyte cells.

         <title>Counterion Effect in Cobaltate&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The counterion makes a difference in alkene hydrogenations promoted by low&#8208;valence cobaltate salts. The best performing catalyst cleanly hydrogenated various alkenes (including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies point toward a homotopic catalyst and show how counterion coordination to hydride intermediates modulates the barrier for the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion.







Abstract
We show that countercations exert a remarkable influence on the ability of anionic cobaltate salts to catalyze challenging alkene hydrogenations. An evaluation of the catalytic properties of [Cat][Co(&#951;4&#8208;cod)2] (Cat=K (1), Na (2), Li (3), (Depnacnac)Mg (4), and N(nBu)4 (5); cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, Depnacnac={2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3NC(CH3)}2CH)]) demonstrated that the lithium salt 3 and magnesium salt 4 drastically outperform the other catalysts. Complex 4 was the most active catalyst, which readily promotes the hydrogenation of highly congested alkenes under mild conditions. A plausible catalytic mechanism is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations. Furthermore, combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and DFT studies were used to examine the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion step. The results of these studies suggest an active co&#8208;catalytic role of the counterion in the hydrogenation reaction through the coordination to cobalt hydride intermediates.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Nanozyme&#8208;Integrated Nanomotors (POMotors) for Self&#8208;Propulsion&#8208;Promoted Synergistic Photothermal&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate nanozyme&#8208;integrated polydopamine&#8208;conjugated nanomotors (POMotors) were constructed. They show peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity and NIR&#8208;triggered photothermal properties, therefore exhibiting enzyme&#8208;powered enhanced Brownian motion and NIR&#8208;triggered self&#8208;propulsion. Based on these properties of POMotors, a highly efficient self&#8208;propulsion&#8208;enhanced photothermal&#8208;catalytic synergistic tumor therapy was achieved.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors have demonstrated promising potential in biomedical applications, especially for catalytic tumor therapy, owing to their ability of self&#8208;propulsion and bio&#8208;catalysis. However, the fragility of natural enzymes limits their environmental adaptability and also therapeutic efficacy in catalysis&#8208;enabled tumor therapy. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;nanozyme&#8208;based light&#8208;driven nanomotors were designed and synthesized for targeted synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic tumor therapy. In this construct, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the P2W18Fe4 polyoxometalates&#8208;based nanomotors can provide self&#8208;propulsion and facilitate their production of reactive oxygen species thus killing tumor cells, even in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment. Conjugated polydopamine endows the nanomotors with the capability of light&#8208;driven self&#8208;propulsion behavior. After 10&#8197;min of NIR (808&#8197;nm) irradiation, along with the help of epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, the targeted accumulation and penetration of nanomotors in the tumor enabled highly efficient synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic therapy. This approach overcomes the disadvantages of the intrinsically fragile nature of enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors in physiological environments and, more importantly, provides a motility&#8208;behavior promoted synergistic anti&#8208;tumor strategy.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Ferrocene Quencher&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanomedicine for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored chemodynamic therapy agent (Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) is prepared by integrating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters via host&#8211;guest interaction. In addition to producing &#8901;OH, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and H2O2 causes Fc oxidation and consequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, allowing renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to self&#8208;monitor &#8901;OH formation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) generation is crucial for both the efficacy and safety of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although &#8901;OH probe&#8208;integrated CDT agents can track &#8901;OH production by themselves, they often require complicated synthetic procedures and suffer from self&#8208;consumption of &#8901;OH. Here, we report the facile fabrication of a self&#8208;monitored chemodynamic agent (denoted as Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) by incorporating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) via host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The water&#8208;soluble CD served not only as a capping agent to protect AuNCs but also as a macrocyclic host to encapsulate and solubilize hydrophobic Fc guest with high Fenton reactivity for in vivo CDT applications. Importantly, the encapsulated Fc inside CD possessed strong electron&#8208;donating ability to effectively quench the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence of AuNCs through photoinduced electron transfer. After internalization of Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs by cancer cells, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused Fc oxidation and subsequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, which was accompanied by the formation of cytotoxic &#8901;OH and therefore allowed Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to in situ self&#8208;report &#8901;OH generation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption. Such a NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored CDT enabled the use of renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs for efficient tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.

Here, we report the facile fabrication of a self-monitored chemodynamic agent (denoted as Fc-CD-AuNCs) by incorporating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;-cyclodextrin (CD)-functionalized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) via host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The water-soluble CD served not only as a capping agent to protect AuNCs but also as a macrocyclic host to encapsulate and solubilize hydrophobic Fc guest with high Fenton reactivity for in vivo CDT applications. Importantly, the encapsulated Fc inside CD possessed strong electron-donating ability to effectively quench the second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence of AuNCs through photoinduced electron transfer. After internalization of Fc-CD-AuNCs by cancer cells, Fenton reaction between redox-active Fc quencher and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) caused Fc oxidation and subsequent NIR-II fluorescence recovery, which was accompanied by the formation of cytotoxic &#8901;OH and therefore allowed Fc-CD-AuNCs to in situ self-report &#8901;OH generation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption. Such a NIR-II fluorescence-monitored CDT enabled the use of renal-clearable Fc-CD-AuNCs for efficient tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Functionalization of an Acyclic Methylene&#8208;Bridged&#8208;Arene Trimer in a Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control of repeating reactions to form oligomeric compounds is challenging because such reactions are controlled only statistically. Here, we show that a coordination cage serves as a nano&#8208;reaction vessel in the iteroselective condensation of a simple aromatic compound and formaldehyde to form a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent iodination of the trimer within the cage.







Abstract
Arene&#8208;formaldehyde condensation is a versatile reaction for producing various oligomeric/polymeric materials. However, the precise control of oligomerization degree is still challenging because the starting materials and intermediates have similar reactivities. Here, we demonstrate the selective synthesis of a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer using the confined cavity of a coordination cage. The limited space of the cavity prevents unregulated polymerization. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent site&#8208;selective iodination of the trimer product within the cage.

In nature, chiral selectivity mainly occurs between different species, such as the production of proteins, enzyme catalysis, or therapeutics using chiral drugs. Thus, great demands are needed to explore the full potential of chiral self&#8208;sorting. In their Research Article (e202316200), Vivian Wing&#8208;Wah Yam et&#8197;al. report different combinations of axial chiral ligands giving rise to distinct chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters through different types of chiral self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sorting processes, evolving from homochiral assembly to heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and the unprecedented heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting.

Axially chiral azomethine imines were efficiently constructed through Cu&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closures of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides.

         <title>Ammonolysis of Glyoxal at the Air&#8208;Water Nanodroplet Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine occurs at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface with the stepwise pathways facilitated by the water dimers, which is highly feasible and plays a pivotal role in removing glyoxal.







Abstract
The reactions of glyoxal (CHO)2) with amines in cloud processes contribute to the formation of brown carbon and oligomer particles in the atmosphere. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we investigate the ammonolysis mechanisms of glyoxal with amines at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface. We identified three and two distinct pathways for the ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine by using metadynamics simulations at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface, respectively. Notably, the stepwise pathways mediated by the water dimer for the reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine display the lowest free energy barriers of 3.6 and 4.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. These results showed that the air&#8208;water nanodroplet ammonolysis reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine were more feasible and occurred at faster rates than the corresponding gas phase ammonolysis, the OH+(CHO)2 reaction, and the aqueous phase reaction of glyoxal, leading to the dominant removal of glyoxal. Our results provide new and important insight into the reactions between carbonyl compounds and amines, which are crucial in forming nitrogen&#8208;containing aerosol particles.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated [3+1] Fragmentation of White Phosphorus: Access to Acylcyanophosphanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White phosphorus (P4) can be selectively activated and functionalized via low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes. Subsequent treatment of the acylated P4 ligands with cyanide induces a rare [3+1] fragmentation and yields cyanophosphanides (P1) and triphosphido cobaltate (P3). Additional experiments with neutral cyanide or isocyanide provide insight into a plausible fragmentation mechanism and allow the isolation of potential intermediates.







Abstract
Despite the accessibility of numerous transition metal polyphosphido complexes through transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated activation of white phosphorus, the targeted functionalization of Pn ligands to obtain functional monophosphorus species remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a new [3+1] fragmentation procedure for cyclo&#8208;P4 ligands, leading to the discovery of acylcyanophosphanides and &#8208;phosphines. Treatment of the complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4)] ([K(18c&#8208;6)]3, 18c&#8208;6=[18]crown&#8208;6, Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;isopropylphenyl, BIAN=1,2&#8208;bis(arylimino)acenaphthene diimine) with acyl chlorides results in the formation of acylated tetraphosphido complexes [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4C(O)R)] (R=tBu, Cy, 1&#8208;Ad, Ph; 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). Subsequent reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with cyanide salts yield acylated cyanophosphanides [RC(O)PCN]&#8722; (9&#8201;a&#8211;d&#8722;) and the cyclo&#8208;P3 cobaltate anion [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;3&#8208;P3)(CN)]&#8722; (8&#8722;). Further reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me3SiCN) and isocyanides provide insight into a plausible mechanism of this [3+1] fragmentation reaction, as these reagents partially displace the P4C(O)R ligand from the cobalt center. Several potential intermediates of the [3+1] fragmentation were characterized. Additionally, the introduction of a second acyl substituent was achieved by treating [K(18c&#8208;6)]9b with CyC(O)Cl, resulting in the first bis(acyl)monocyanophosphine (CyC(O))2PCN (10).

Further reactions of &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; with trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCN) and isocyanides provide insight into a plausible mechanism of this [3+1] fragmentation reaction, as these reagents partially displace the P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)R ligand from the cobalt center. Several potential intermediates of the [3+1] fragmentation were characterized. Additionally, the introduction of a second acyl substituent was achieved by treating [K(18c-6)]&lt;b&gt;9b&lt;/b&gt; with CyC(O)Cl, resulting in the first bis(acyl)monocyanophosphine (CyC(O))&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PCN (&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Methylation Yields Acceptor with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network for High&#8208;Efficiency and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed four small&#8208;molecule acceptors (Qo1, Qo2, Qo3 and Qo4) by incorporating a methylation strategy. Solar cells fabricated with polymer donor PM6 and Qo2 realized the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%).







Abstract
Utilizing intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions stands for an effective approach in advancing the efficiency and stability of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) for polymer solar cells. Herein, we synthesized three SMAs (Qo1, Qo2, and Qo3) using indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoxalin&#8208;11&#8208;one (Qox) as the electron&#8208;deficient group, with the incorporation of a methylation strategy. Through crystallographic analysis, it is observed that two Qox&#8208;based methylated acceptors (Qo2 and Qo3) exhibit multiple hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted 3D network transport structures, in contrast to the 2D transport structure observed in gem&#8208;dichlorinated counterpart (Qo4). Notably, Qo2 exhibits multiple and stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions compared with Qo3. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device realizes the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%). This remarkable PCE in PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device can be primarily ascribed to the enhanced donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility, more favorable medium structure, and more efficient charge transfer and collection behavior. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, retaining 82.8&#8201;% of its initial PCE after undergoing annealing at 65&#8201;&#176;C for 250&#8197;hours. Our research showcases that precise methylation, particularly targeting the formation of intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions to tune crystal packing patterns, represents a promising strategy in the molecular design of efficient and stable SMAs.

A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafulleranes is presented. Template effects of Cl&#8722; are investigated for the [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; complexes that are classified as &#8220;confined Lewis pairs&#8221;.

Abstract
A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafullerane derivatives [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; (X=F&#8208;I Y=F&#8208;I, H, Me, Et) and 
&#8208;[Cl@Si20H12Y8]&#8722; (Y=F&#8208;I) is presented. First, we evaluated the structure&#8208;determining template effect of Cl&#8722; in a systematic series of concave silapolyquinane model systems. Second, we investigated the X&#8722;&#8594;Si20 interaction energy (
) as a function of X&#8722; and Y and found the largest 
 values for electron&#8208;withdrawing exohedral substituents&#8197;Y. Given that X&#8722; ions can be considered as Lewis bases and empty Si20Y20 clusters as Lewis acids, we classify our inseparable host&#8211;guest complexes [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; as &#8220;confined Lewis pairs&#8221;. Third, 35Cl NMR spectroscopy proved to be highly diagnostic for an experimental assessment of the Cl&#8722;&#8594;Si20 interaction as the paramagnetic shielding and, in turn, 
(35Cl) of the endohedral Cl&#8722; ion correlate inversely with 
. Finally, we disclose the synthesis of [PPN][Cl@Si20Y20] (Y=Me, Et, Br) and provide a thorough characterization of these new silafulleranes.

         <title>Asymmetric Solvents Regulated Crystallization&#8208;Limited Electrolytes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric solvents regulated crystallization limitation strategy is developed to lower electrolyte operation temperature windows for lithium metal batteries. Mixing asymmetric ethylene sulfite (ES) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) can reduce the molecular interaction and orientation arrangement dynamics, allowing the resulting electrolyte to show fast ion transport even at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Electrolytes that can keep liquid state are one of the most important physical metrics to ensure the ions transfer with stable operation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries at a wide temperature window. It is generally accepted that strong polar solvents with high melting points favor the safe operation of batteries above room temperatures but are susceptible to crystallization at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). Here, a crystallization limitation strategy was proposed to handle this issue. We demonstrate that, although the high melting points of ethylene sulfite (ES, &#8722;17&#8201;&#176;C) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, &#8776;23&#8201;&#176;C), their mixtures can avoid crystallization at low temperatures, which can be attributed to low intermolecular interactions and altered molecular motion dynamics. A suitable ES/FEC ratio (10&#8201;% FEC) can balance the bulk and interface transport of ions, enabling LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||lithium (NCM811||Li) full cells to deliver excellent temperature resilience and cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to +70&#8201;&#176;C. More than 66&#8201;% of the capacity retention was achieved at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C compared to room temperature. The NCM811||Li pouch cells exhibit high cycling stability under realistic conditions (electrolyte weight to cathode capacity ratio (E/C)&#8804;3.5&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, negative to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P)&#8804;1.09) at different temperatures.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange in 3D Cell Culture Hydrogels Based on Crosslinking of Cyclic Thiosulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic thiosulfinates can generate disulfide&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent hydrogels without additional stimuli to gain control over stress relaxation based on thiol content and mode of crosslinker application. Pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes can be 3D cultured in hydrogels containing macromonomers with this chemistry, displaying native behaviours, such as cell spreading and spontaneous beating.







Abstract
Dynamic polymer materials are highly valued substrates for 3D cell culture due to their viscoelasticity, a time&#8208;dependent mechanical property that can be tuned to resemble the energy dissipation of native tissues. Herein, we report the coupling of a cyclic thiosulfinate, mono&#8208;S&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;methyl asparagusic acid, to a 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;OH to prepare a disulfide&#8208;based dynamic covalent hydrogel with the addition of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;thiol. Ring opening of the cyclic thiosulfinate by nucleophilic substitution results in the rapid formation of a network showing a viscoelastic fluid&#8208;like behaviour and relaxation rates modulated by thiol content through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange, whereas its viscoelastic behaviour upon application as a small molecule linear crosslinker is solid&#8208;like. Further introduction of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;vinylsulfone in the network yields a hydrogel with weeks&#8208;long cell culture stability, permitting 3D culture of cell types that lack robust proliferation, such as human pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC&#8208;CMs). These cells display native behaviours such as cell elongation and spontaneous beating as a function of the hydrogel's mechanical properties. We demonstrate that the mode of dynamic cyclic thiosulfinate crosslinker presentation within the network can result in different stress relaxation profiles, opening the door to model tissues with disparate mechanics in 3D cell culture.

     alt="Dynamic Exchange in 3D Cell Culture Hydrogels Based on Crosslinking of Cyclic Thiosulfinates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic thiosulfinates can generate disulfide-crosslinked dynamic covalent hydrogels without additional stimuli to gain control over stress relaxation based on thiol content and mode of crosslinker application. Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes can be 3D cultured in hydrogels containing macromonomers with this chemistry, displaying native behaviours, such as cell spreading and spontaneous beating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic polymer materials are highly valued substrates for 3D cell culture due to their viscoelasticity, a time-dependent mechanical property that can be tuned to resemble the energy dissipation of native tissues. Herein, we report the coupling of a cyclic thiosulfinate, mono-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxo-4-methyl asparagusic acid, to a 4-arm PEG-OH to prepare a disulfide-based dynamic covalent hydrogel with the addition of 4-arm PEG-thiol. Ring opening of the cyclic thiosulfinate by nucleophilic substitution results in the rapid formation of a network showing a viscoelastic fluid-like behaviour and relaxation rates modulated by thiol content through thiol-disulfide exchange, whereas its viscoelastic behaviour upon application as a small molecule linear crosslinker is solid-like. Further introduction of 4-arm PEG-vinylsulfone in the network yields a hydrogel with weeks-long cell culture stability, permitting 3D culture of cell types that lack robust proliferation, such as human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). These cells display native behaviours such as cell elongation and spontaneous beating as a function of the hydrogel's mechanical properties. We demonstrate that the mode of dynamic cyclic thiosulfinate crosslinker presentation within the network can result in different stress relaxation profiles, opening the door to model tissues with disparate mechanics in 3D cell culture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrated [3+2] Cyclotelomerization of Butafulvenes to Create Multiple Contiguous Fully Substituted Carbon Centers</title>

A hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes has been developed to create spiro fused tricyclic rings with a contiguous fully substituted carbon motif.







Abstract
The construction of multiple continuous fully substituted carbon centers, which serve as unique structural motif in natural products, is a challenging topic in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes to create contiguous fully substituted carbon backbone. In the presence of scandium triflate, all&#8208;carbon skeleton with spiro fused tricyclic ring can be constructed in high diastereoselectivity by utilizing butafulvene as the synthon. Mechanistic studies suggest that this atom&#8208;economic reaction probably proceeds through a synergistic process containing butafulvenes dimerization and nucleophilic attack by water. In addition, the tricyclic product can undergo a series of synthetic derivatizations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy. The recyclability of Sc(OTf)3 has also been demonstrated to show its robust performance in this hydrated cyclotelomerization.
