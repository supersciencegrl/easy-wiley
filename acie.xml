         <title>Cross&#8208;linkable fullerene enables elastic and conductive grain boundaries for efficient and wearable tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have received increasing attention due to their low toxicity, high theoretical efficiency, and potential applications as wearable devices. However, the inherent fast and uncontrollable crystallization process of tin&#8208;based perovskites results in high defect density in the film. Meanwhile, when fabricated into flexible devices, the prepared perovskite film exhibits inevitable brittleness and high Young's modulus, seriously weakening the mechanical stability. In this work, we design and synthesize a cross&#8208;linkable fullerene, thioctic acid functionalized C60 fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (FTAI), which has multiple interactions with perovskite components and can finely regulate the crystallization quality of perovskite film. The obtained perovskite film shows an increased grain size and a more matched energy level with the electron transport material, effectively improving the carrier extraction efficiency. The FTAI&#8208;based rigid device achieves a champion efficiency of 14.91% with enhanced stability. More importantly, the FTAI located at the perovskite grain boundaries could spontaneously cross&#8208;link during the perovskite annealing process, which effectively improves the conductivity and elasticity of grain boundaries, thereby giving the film excellent bending resistance. Finally, the FTAI&#8208;based wearable device yields a record efficiency of 12.35% and displays robust bending durability, retaining about 90% of the initial efficiency after 10,000 bending times.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical CO2&#160;Activation and Valorization on Metallic Copper and Carbon&#8208;Embedded N&#8208;Coordinated Single Metal MNC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2, referred to as the CO2RR, is an emerging approach for the conversion of CO2&#8208;containing feeds into valuable carbonaceous fuels and chemicals, with potential contributions to carbon capture and use (CCU) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts exhibit distinctive reactivity, attracting attention as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR. This review offers a comparative analysis of CO2RR on copper surfaces and MNC catalysts, highlighting their unique characteristics in terms of CO2 activation, C1/C2(+) product formation, and the competing hydrogen evolution pathway. The assessment underscores the significance of understanding structure&#8208;activity relationships to optimize catalyst design for efficient and selective CO2RR.
Examining detailed reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;selectivity patterns, the analysis explores recent insights into changes in the chemical catalyst states, atomic motif rearrangements, and fractal agglomeration, providing essential kinetic information from advanced in/ex&#8208;situ microscopy/spectroscopy techniques. At the end, this review addresses future challenges and solutions related to today&#8217;s disconnect between our current molecular understanding of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;selectivity relations in CO2RR and the relevant factors controlling the performance of CO2&#160;electrolyzers over longer times, at larger electrode sizes, and at higher current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Programmed Biosynthesis of Heterotrimeric Fungal Depside Thielavin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thielavin A (1) is a fungal depside composed of one 3&#8208;methylorsellinic acid and two 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid units. It displays diverse biological activities. However, the mechanism underlying the assembly of the heterotrimeric structure of 1 remains to be clarified. In this study, we identified the polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of 1. This PKS, designated as ThiA, possesses an unusual domain organization with the C&#8208;methyltransferase (MT) domain situated at the C&#8208;terminus following the thioesterase (TE) domain. Our findings indicated that the TE domain is solely responsible for two rounds of ester bond formation, along with subsequent chain hydrolysis. We identified a plausible mechanism for TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions and obtained insights into how a single PKS can selectively yield a specific heterotrimeric product. In particular, the tandem acyl carrier protein domains of ThiA are critical for programmed methylation by the MT domain. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence of highly optimized domain&#8211;domain communication within ThiA for the selective synthesis of 1, which can advance our understanding of the programming rules of fungal PKSs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Interphases Regulated by Trace Dual Electrolyte Additives for Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic zinc is a promising anode material for rechargeable aqueous multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries due to its high capacity and low cost. However, the practical use is always beset by severe dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions occurring at anode/electrolyte interface. Here we demonstrate that dynamic molecular interphases caused by trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate for ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. Triggered by plating and stripping electric fields, the D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species are alternately and reversibly (de&#8208;)adsorbed on Zn metal, respectively, to accelerate Zn2+ transportation for uniform Zn nucleation and deposition and inhibit side reactions for high coulombic efficiency. As a result, Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating behaviors for &gt;6400 hours at 1 mA cm&#8722;2, which enables long&#8208;term cycling stability of Zn||ZnxMnO2 full cell for more than 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Upcycling and Depolymerization of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic upcycling and depolymerization of vinyl polymers have emerged as promising strategies to combat plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. This mini review critically summarizes current developments in the upcycling and degradation of vinyl polymers including polystyrene and poly(meth)acrylates. Of these material classes, polymethacrylates also possess the unique possibility to undergo a photocatalytic depolymerization back to monomer under thermodynamically favourable conditions, thus presenting significant advantages over traditional thermal strategies. Our perspective on current formidable challenges and potential future directions are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photochemical&#160;Cascade Process Boosting Smart Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Bismuth Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), exhibiting multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, has garnered considerable attention due to its potential applications in light&#8208;emitting devices, sensors, and information safety. This work proposes the utilization of photochemical cascade processes (PCCPs) in molecular crystals to design a stepwise smart RTP switch. By harnessing the sequential dynamics of photo&#8208;burst movement (induced by [2+2] photocycloaddition) and photochromism (induced by photogenerated radicals) in a Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic halide&#160;(MOH), a continuous and photo&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP can be achieved. Furthermore, utilizing the same Bi&#8208;based MOH, diverse application demonstrations, such as multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption, can be easily implemented. This work thus not only serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the development of solid&#8208;state PCCPs that integrate photosalient effect and photochromism with light&#8208;chemical&#8208;mechanical energy conversion, but also lays the groundwork for designing new Bi&#8208;based MOHs with dynamically responsive ultralong RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>A NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Probe for High Spatial Quantitative Imaging of Tumor Nitric Oxide in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) exhibits both pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;tumor effects. Therefore, real&#8208;time in vivo imaging and quantification of tumor NO dynamics are essential for understanding the conflicting roles of NO played in pathophysiology. The current molecular probes, however, cannot provide high&#8208;resolution imaging in deep tissues, making them unsuitable for these purposes. Herein, we designed a photoacoustic probe with an absorption maximum beyond 1000 nm for high spatial quantitative imaging of in vivo tumor NO dynamics. The probe exhibits remarkable sensitivity, selective ratiometric response behavior, and good tumor&#8208;targeting abilities, facilitating ratiometric imaging of tumor NO throughout tumor progression in a micron&#8208;resolution level. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully quantified NO dynamics in tumor, liver and kidney. We have pinpointed an essential concentration threshold of around 80 nmol/cm3 for NO, which plays a crucial role in the "double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword" function of NO in tumors. Furthermore, we revealed a reciprocal relationship between the NO concentration in tumors and that in the liver, providing initial insights into the possible NO&#8208;mediated communication between tumor and the liver. We believe that the probe will help resolve conflicting aspects of NO biology and guide the design of imaging agents for tumor diagnosis and anti&#8208;cancer drug screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase: on the Detection and Stability of the Initial Carbonyloxy Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), light&#8208;induced formation of the primary radical product RCOO&#9679; from fatty acid RCOO&#8211; occurs in 300&#160;ps, upon which CO2 is released quasi&#8208;immediately. Based on the hypothesis that aliphatic RCOO&#9679; (spectroscopically uncharacterized because unstable) absorbs in the red similarly to aromatic carbonyloxy radicals such as 2,6&#8209;dichlorobenzoyloxy radical (DCB&#9679;), much longer&#8208;lived linear RCOO&#9679; has been suggested recently. We performed quantum chemical reaction pathway and spectral calculations. These calculations are in line with the experimental DCB&#9679; decarboxylation dynamics and spectral properties and show that in contrast to DCB&#9679;, aliphatic RCOO&#9679; radicals a) decarboxylate with a very low energetic barrier and on the timescale of a few ps and b) exhibit little red absorption. A time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy experiment confirms very rapid, &lt;&lt;300&#160;ps RCOO&#9679; decarboxylation in FAP. We argue that this property is required for the observed high quantum yield of hydrocarbons formation by FAP.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous Regulation of d&#8208;Band Centers in Zn Substrates and Weakening Pauli Repulsion of Zn ions using the Ascorbic Acid Additive for Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) are still challenging due to the harmful reactions including hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a natural small molecule acid vitamin C (Vc) as an aqueous electrolyte additive has been selectively identified. The small molecule Vc can adjust the d band center of Zn substrate which fixes the active H+ so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is restrained. Simultaneously, it could also fine&#8211;tune the solvation structure of Zn ions due to the enhanced electrostatics and reduced Pauli repulsion verified by energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Hence, the cell retains an ultra&#8211;long cycle performance of over 1300 cycles and a superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5%. The prepared full cells display increased rate capability, cycle lifetime, and self&#8211;discharge suppression. Our results shed light on the mechanistic principle of electrolyte additives on the performance improvement of ZIBs, which is anticipated to render a new round of studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Azo&#8208;free Mitsunobu&#8208;type Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The classic chemical Mitsunobu reaction suffers from the need of excess alcohol activation reagents and the generation of significant by&#8208;products. Efforts to overcome these limitations have resulted in numerous creative solutions, but the substrate scope of these catalytic processes remains limited. Here we report an electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, which features azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope. This user&#8208;friendly technology allows a vast collection of heterocycles as the nucleophile, which can couple with a series of chiral cyclic and acyclic alcohols in moderate to high yields and excellent ee&#8217;s. This practical reaction is scalable, chemoselective, uses simple Electrasyn setup with inexpensive electrodes and requires no precaution to exclude air and moisture. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated on the structural modification of diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical derivatives and its straightforward application in a multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivated Circularly Polarized Luminescent Organic Radicals in Doped Amorphous Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organic radicals, especially those with photoactivated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features, hold great significance for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications, but their development still remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to achieve photoactivated CPL radicals by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system, yielding a compound of R/S&#8208;5,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bibenzo[d][1,3]dioxole (R/S&#8208;BDP). The photoactivated R/S&#8208;BDP molecules in polymer matrix display a robust quantum yield of 19.8% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.2&#215;10&#8208;4, marking this work as the first example of photoactivated CPL radicals. Furthermore, the glum is improved to 1.0&#215;10&#8208;2 by using a liquid crystal as host. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that R/S&#8208;BDP molecules, endowed with double phosphine cores in axial chirality, offer a direct way for intramolecular electron transfer upon photoirradiation. This leads to the generation of radical ionic pairs, which subsequently trigger the donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement through intermolecular electron transfer, thereby resulting in stable radical emission. The extended photoactivated BDP&#8208;F exhibits a remarkably high quantum efficiency of 57.8%. Ultimately, the distinctive photo&#8208;responsive CPL radical luminescence has been successfully used for information displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Four&#8208;electron Conversion in Tellurium Cathodes for Advanced Magnesium&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium (Mg) batteries hold promise as a large&#8208;scale energy storage solution, but their progress has been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Here, we address this challenge by unlocking the reversible four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of superior Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. Specifically, the classic magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte is tailored by introducing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2), which initiates the Te0/Te4+ conversion with two distinct charge&#8208;storage steps. Te cathode undergoes Te/TeCl4 conversion involving Cl&#8211; as charge carriers, during which a tellurium subchloride phase is presented as an intermediate. Significantly, the Te cathode achieves a high specific capacity of 543 mAh gTe&#8211;1 and an outstanding energy density of 850 Wh kgTe&#8211;1, outperforming most of the previously reported cathodes. Our electrolyte analysis indicates that the addition of Mg(TFSI)2 reduces the overall ion&#8208;molecule interaction and mitigates the strength of ion&#8208;solvent aggregation within the MACC electrolyte, which implies the facilized Cl&#8211; dissociation from the electrolyte. Besides, Mg(TFSI)2 is verified as an essential buffer to mitigate the corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes caused by the consumption of the electrolyte MgCl2 in Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion cells. These findings provide crucial insights into the development of advanced Mg&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Boryl Ancillary Ligands: Influencing Stability and Reactivity of Amidinato&#8208;Silanone and Germanone Systems in Ammonia Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the nucleophilic addition of ammonia to ketones is an archetypal reaction in classical organic chemistry, the reactivity of heavier group 14 carbonyl analogues (R2E=O; E = Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb) with NH3 remains sparsely investigated, primarily due to the synthetic difficulties in accessing heavier ketone congeners. Herein, we present a room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue), formed from the corresponding silylene under a N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2). Quantum chemical cal&#8208;culations reveal that the formation of this sila&#8208;hemiaminal is crucially dependent on the nature of the ancillary ligand scaffold. It is facilitated thermodynamically by the hemi&#8208;lability of the amidinate ligand (which allows for the formation of an energetically critical intramolecular N&#8230;HO hydrogen bond within the product) and is enabled mechanistically by a process in which the silanone initially acts in umpolung fashion as a base (rather than an acid), due to the strongly electron&#8208;releasing and sterically bulky nature of the ancillary boryl ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Stereoselective Glycomodification of Biomolecules through Carbohydrate&#8208;Promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycomodification strategy targeting N&#8208;terminal tryptophan of biomolecules was developed using C6&#8208;oxidized glycans through a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, providing homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages. This method features high efficiency, mild conditions, robustness, biocompatibility, and applicability to a wide range of substrates, including glycans, peptides, proteins, and living&#8208;cell surfaces.







Abstract
Carbohydrates play pivotal roles in an array of essential biological processes and are consequently involved in many diseases. To meet the needs of glycobiology research, chemical enzymatic and non&#8208;enzymatic methods have been developed to generate glycoconjugates with well&#8208;defined structures. Herein, harnessing the unique properties of C6&#8208;oxidized glycans, we report a straightforward and robust strategy for site&#8208; and stereoselective glycomodification of biomolecules with N&#8208;terminal tryptophan residues by a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, which is not adapted to typical aldehyde substrates under biocompatible conditions. This method reliably delivers highly homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages and thus has great potential for functional modulation of peptides and proteins in glycobiology research. Moreover, this reaction can be performed at the glycosites of glycopeptides, glycoproteins and living&#8208;cell surfaces in a site&#8208;specific manner. Control experiments indicated that the protected &#945;&#8208;O atom of aldehyde donors and free N&#8722;H bond of the tryptamine motif are crucial for this reaction. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that the reaction exhibited a first&#8208;order dependence on both tryptophan and glycan, and deprotonation/rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Low&#8208;coordination Nanocrystalline Copper&#8208;based Catalysts through Theory&#8208;guided Electrochemical Restructuring for Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the electrochemical restructuring calculation of Cu catalysts, a customized, low&#8208;coordination Cu catalyst was prepared for the efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethylene. Benefiting from this excellent catalyst, the selectivity of CO2 conversion to ethylene reached 72% at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a durable stability of 230 hours in an electrolyzer.







Abstract
Revealing the dynamic reconstruction process and tailoring advanced copper (Cu) catalysts is of paramount significance for promoting the conversion of CO2 into ethylene (C2H4), paving the way for carbon neutralization and facilitating renewable energy storage. In this study, we initially employed density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the restructuring behavior of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions and delineated its restructuring patterns. Leveraging insights into this restructuring behavior, we devised an efficient, low&#8208;coordination copper&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting synthesized catalyst demonstrated an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70&#8201;% for ethylene generation at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it showed robust stability, maintaining consistent performance for 230&#8197;hours at a cell voltage of 3.5&#8197;V in a full&#8208;cell system. Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts but also advances CO2 electrolysis technologies for industrial application.

A trisulfur radical anion (S3&#8901;&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) has been developed. This domino protocol is featured by no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;pot reaction. A plausible mechanism has been proposed by control experiments, intermediate trapping experiments, etc. The unique unsymmetric structure of DBTDT endows it with herringbone packing structure and weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules as well as high transfer integrals, which enables a high carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Unsymmetric organic semiconductors have many advantages such as good solubility, rich intermolecular interactions for potential various optoelectronic applications. However, their synthesis is more challenging due to intricate structures thus normally suffering tedious synthesis. Herein, we report a trisulfur radical anion (S3&#8901;&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) using readily available 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;ethynylbenzenes as starting materials. This domino protocol features no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;C bonds in a one&#8208;pot reaction. Mechanistic study revealed a unique domino radical anion pathway. Single crystal structure analysis of unsymmetric DBTDT shows that its unique unsymmetric structure endows rich and multiple weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules, which enables the large intermolecular transfer integrals of 86&#8197;meV and efficient charge transport performance with a carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This study provides a facile and highly efficient synthetic strategy for more high&#8208;performance unsymmetric organic semiconductors.

         <dc:description>
We prepared homogeneous Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt high&#8208;entropy solid solutions with adjustable compositisions as multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts for NOx reduction. The elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover were well&#8208;coupled on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, mainly responsible for the superior activities over pure Rh.







Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with four, five or more metals significantly can yield the developments of functional materials with excellent performances in various reactions. However, the underlying reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis for HEA have been rarely investigated, due to their diverse elements and complex compositions. In this study, we successfully synthesized the homogeneously dispersed Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt HEA with adjustable compositions, as the multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (MASC). In the NOx reduction performance tests, Ru0.4 (Rh0.33Pd0.33Pt0.33)0.6 MASC showed the highest activity, which was significantly improved compared to that of the best monometal Rh, with the light&#8208;off temperature decreasing by ca. 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the outstanding activity of Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt MASC was attributable to the well&#8208;coupled elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, which explained the first clear reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis for HEA.

&lt;p&gt;We prepared homogeneous Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt high-entropy solid solutions with adjustable compositisions as multiple-atom-site catalysts for NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover were well-coupled on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, mainly responsible for the superior activities over pure Rh.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-entropy-alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with four, five or more metals significantly can yield the developments of functional materials with excellent performances in various reactions. However, the underlying reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis for HEA have been rarely investigated, due to their diverse elements and complex compositions. In this study, we successfully synthesized the homogeneously dispersed Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt HEA with adjustable compositions, as the multiple-atom-site catalysts (MASC). In the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; reduction performance tests, Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt; (Rh&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt; MASC showed the highest activity, which was significantly improved compared to that of the best monometal Rh, with the light-off temperature decreasing by &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the outstanding activity of Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt MASC was attributable to the well-coupled elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, which explained the first clear reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis for HEA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hybrid Redox&#8208;Mediated Zinc&#8208;Air Fuel Cell for Scalable and Sustained Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell that liberates the zinc reaction from the electrode to a separate fuel tank was demonstrated, which enabled a facile zinc refueling in the tank and attained a record&#8208;high power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah by optimizing system kinetics. The zinc evolution mechanism during redox&#8208;mediated reaction was unveiled for the first time using various in situ characterization techniques.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have attracted considerable attention for their high energy density, safety, low noise, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, the capacity of mechanically rechargeable ZABs was limited by the cumbersome procedure for replacing the zinc anode, while electrically rechargeable ZABs suffer from issues including low depth of discharge, zinc dendrite and dead zinc formation, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, etc. To address these issues, we report a hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell (HRM&#8208;ZAFC) utilizing 7,8&#8208;dihydroxyphenazine&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (DHPS) as the anolyte redox mediator, which shifts the zinc oxidation reaction from the electrode surface to a separate fuel tank. This approach decouples fuel feeding and electricity generation, providing greater operation flexibility and scalability for large&#8208;scale power generation applications. The DHPS&#8208;mediated ZAFC exhibited a superior peak power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and a continuous discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah with ZnO as the discharge product in the tank, highlighting its potential for power generation.

         <title>Glutathione Induced In situ Synthesis of Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Anaerobic Glycolysis Metabolism Interference for Boosting Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ synthesis strategy for Cu single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8722;O2/Cu&#8722;O4). The in situ activation process specifically disturbed copper metabolism pathway, thereby leading to enhanced copper deposition in cytoplasm for boosted cuproptosis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) has sparked increasing interest for catalytic antitumor treatment due to their more tunable and diverse active sites than natural metalloenzymes in complex physiological conditions. However, it is usually a hard task to precisely conduct catalysis at tumor sites after intravenous injection of those SAzyme with high reactivity. Moreover, the explorations of SAzymes in the anticancer application are still in its infancy and need to be developed. Herein, an in situ synthesis strategy for Cu SAzyme was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8722;O2/Cu&#8722;O4) via GSH&#8208;responsive deformability of supports. Our results suggest that the in situ activation process could further facilitate the dissociation of copper ions and the consumption of glutathione, thereby leading to copper deposition in cytoplasm and triggering cuproptosis. Moreover, the in situ synthesis of Cu SAzyme with peroxidase&#8208;like activity enabled the intracellular reactive oxygen species production, resulting in specifically disturbance of copper metabolism pathway. Meanwhile, the in situ exposed glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor phloretin (Ph) can block the glycose uptake to boost cuproptosis efficacy. Overall, this in situ activation strategy effectively diminished the off&#8208;target effects of SACs&#8208;induced catalytic therapies and introduced a promising treatment paradigm for advancing cuproptosis&#8208;associated therapies.

         <title>A Semi&#8208;Automated, High&#8208;Throughput Approach for the Synthesis and Identification of Highly Photo&#8208;Cytotoxic Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 90 iridium(III) complexes has been obtained via a combinatorial synthetic approach. The biophysical and cellular properties of the compounds have been studied using automated workflows, allowing us to identify compounds that are well tolerated in the dark but display nM phototoxicity against cancer cells. DFT calculations have been used to determine some key electronic parameters and study correlations with the experimental data.







Abstract
The discovery of new compounds with pharmacological properties is usually a lengthy, laborious and expensive process. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing workflows that allow for the rapid synthesis and evaluation of libraries of compounds with the aim of identifying leads for further drug development. Herein, we apply combinatorial synthesis to build a library of 90&#8197;iridium(III) complexes (81 of which are new) over two synthesise&#8208;and&#8208;test cycles, with the aim of identifying potential agents for photodynamic therapy. We demonstrate the power of this approach by identifying highly active complexes that are well&#8208;tolerated in the dark but display very low nM phototoxicity against cancer cells. To build a detailed structure&#8211;activity relationship for this class of compounds we have used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine some key electronic parameters and study correlations with the experimental data. Finally, we present an optimised semi&#8208;automated synthesise&#8208;and&#8208;test protocol to obtain multiplex data within 72&#8197;hours.

         <title>Biocatalytic Steroidal 9&#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation and Fragmentation Enable the Concise Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Secosteroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ten 9,10&#8208;secosteroids were synthesized from readily available steroids in three to eight steps via a chemoenzymatic approach. The key feature lies in utilizing the Rieske oxygenase 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as a biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through a 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade.







Abstract
9,10&#8208;Secosteroids are an important group of marine steroids with diverse biological activities. Herein, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for the concise, modular, and scalable synthesis of ten naturally occurring 9,10&#8208;secosteroids from readily available steroids in three to eight steps. The key feature lies in utilizing a Rieske oxygenase&#8208;like 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as the biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation. With synthesized 9,10&#8208;secosteroides, structure&#8211;activity relationship was evaluated based on bioassays in terms of previously unexplored anti&#8208;infective activity. This study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the biosynthetic pathway through which 9,10&#8208;secosteroids are formed in nature shares a similar 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade. In addition to the development of a biomimetic approach for 9,10&#8208;secosteroid synthesis, this study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in chemical synthesis.

Synthetic siderophores are conjugated to antibacterial antisense sequences to efficiently deliver them into bacteria. The conjugates display effective protein downregulation and potent antibacterial properties. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore demonstrate transport through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway.







Abstract
Antibacterial resistance is a major threat for human health. There is a need for new antibacterials to stay ahead of constantly&#8208;evolving resistant bacteria. Nucleic acid therapeutics hold promise as powerful antibiotics, but issues with their delivery hamper their applicability. Here, we exploit the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway to efficiently transport antisense oligomers into bacteria. We appended a synthetic siderophore to antisense oligomers targeting the essential acpP gene in Escherichia coli. Siderophore&#8208;conjugated PNA and PMO antisense oligomers displayed potent antibacterial properties. Conjugates bearing a minimal siderophore consisting of a mono&#8208;catechol group showed equally effective. Targeting the lacZ transcript resulted in dose&#8208;dependent decreased &#946;&#8208;galactosidase production, demonstrating selective protein downregulation. Applying this concept to Acinetobacter baumannii also showed concentration&#8208;dependent growth inhibition. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore verified selective uptake through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway. Lastly, no toxicity towards mammalian cells was found. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that large nucleic acid therapeutics can be efficiently transported into bacteria using synthetic siderophore mimics.

         <title>Robust, Ultrafast and Reversible Photoswitching in Bulk Polymers Enabled by Octupolar Molecule Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octupolar design paradigm is introduced to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs). Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to overcome traditional solid&#8208;state photochromism limitations and attain robust ultrafast bidirectional photochromism in bulk polymers. This together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing enables versatile uses of MOPSAs as smart inks or labels for diverse applications.







Abstract
Improving the photoswitching rate and robustness of photochromic molecules in bulk solids is paramount for practical applications but remains an on&#8208;going challenge. Here, we introduce an octupolar design paradigm to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs) featuring a C3&#8208;symmetrical A3&#8208;(D&#8208;core) architecture with a dipolar donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) photochrome in each branch. Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to enable robust ultrafast reversible photoswitching in bulk polymers. Specifically, the optimal MOPSA (4&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in commercial polyurethane films accomplishes nearly 100&#8201;% discoloration in 6&#8197;s under visible light with &#8764; 100&#8201;% thermal&#8208;recovery in 17.4&#8197;s at 60&#8201;&#176;C, while the acquired kinetics constants are 3&#8764;7&#8197;times that of dipolar DASA counterpart and 1&#8764;2&#8197;orders of magnitude higher than those of reported DASAs in polymers. Importantly, the MOPSA&#8208;doped polymer films sustain 500 discoloration/recovery cycles with slow degradation, superior to the existing DASAs in polymers (&#8804;30&#8197;cycles). We discover that multi&#8208;dipolar coupling in MOPSA enables enhanced polarization and electron delocalization, promoting the rate&#8208;determining thermal cyclization, while the branched and non&#8208;planar geometry of MOPSA induces large free volume to facilitate the isomerization. This design can be extended to develop spiropyran or azobenzene&#8208;based ultrafast photochromic films. The superior photoswitching performance of MOPSAs together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing inspires us to explore their versatile uses as smart inks or labels for time&#8208;temperature indicators, optical logic encryption and multi&#8208;levelled data encryption.

         <title>Probing Coordination Number of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by d&#8208;Band Center&#8208;Regulated Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the d&#8208;band center as a bridge, the correlation between the coordination number (CN) and the acetone cataluminescence (CTL) was establised. A versatile d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone CTL platform was thus developed for the rapid measurement of the CN of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs).







Abstract
It is essential to probe the coordination number (CN) because it is a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X&#8208;ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt&#8208;SACs. It is disclosed that the CN&#8208;triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of d&#8208;band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone&#8208;CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe&#8208;SACs. This work has opened a new avenue for exploring an alternative to synchrotron XAS for the determination of CN of SACs and even conventional metal catalysts through d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated CTL.

         <title>Exfoliation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Give 2D MOF Nanosheets for the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to synthesize ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is developed by selective thermal decomposition and liquid nitrogen exfoliation. This method advances the precise control of chemical bonds to give materials that are shown to be active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The structure and properties of materials are determined by a diverse range of chemical bond formation and breaking mechanisms, which greatly motivates the development of selectively controlling the chemical bonds in order to achieve materials with specific characteristics. Here, an orientational intervening bond&#8208;breaking strategy is demonstrated for synthesizing ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets through balancing the process of thermal decomposition and liquid nitrogen exfoliation. In such approach, proper thermal treatment can weaken the interlayer bond while maintaining the stability of the intralayer bond in the layered MOFs. And the following liquid nitrogen treatment results in significant deformation and stress in the layered MOFs&#8217; structure due to the instant temperature drop and drastic expansion of liquid N2, leading to the curling, detachment, and separation of the MOF layers. The produced MOF nanosheets with five cycles of treatment are primarily composed of nanosheets that are less than 10&#8197;nm in thickness. The MOF nanosheets exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxygen evolution reactions owing to the ultrathin thickness without capping agents which provide improved charge transfer efficiency and dense exposed active sites. This strategy underscores the significance of orientational intervention in chemical bonds to engineer innovative materials.

         <title>Activating Interfacial Electron Redistribution in Lattice&#8208;matched Biphasic Ni3N&#8208;Co3N for Energy&#8208;efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production via Coupled Hydrazine Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;purity and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density green hydrogen through water electrolysis holds immense promise, but issues such as electrocatalyst costs and power consumption have hampered its practical application. In this study, we present a promising solution to these challenges through the use of a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production via coupled hydrazine degradation. The biphasic metal nitrides with highly lattice&#8208;matched structures are deliberately constructed, forming an enhanced local electric field between the electron&#8208;rich Ni3N and electron&#8208;deficient Co3N. Additionally, Mn is introduced as an electric field engine to further activate electron redistribution. Our Mn@Ni3N&#8208;Co3N/NF bifunctional electrocatalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade current densities of 500 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.49 V without degradation, saving at least 53.3% energy consumption compared to conventional alkaline water electrolysis. This work will stimulate the further development of metal nitride electrocatalysts and also provide new perspectives on low&#8208;cost hydrogen production and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Heteroatom Coordination and Hydrogen Evolution for Single&#8208;site Pt on Carbon&#8208;based Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic performance of single&#8208;site catalysts (SSCs) is closely correlated with the electronic structure of metal atoms. Herein we construct a series of Pt SSCs on undoped and heteroatom&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, which exhibit increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along S&#8208;, P&#8208;, C&#8208; and N&#8208;coordinated Pt SSCs. Theoretical simulation indicates a multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process on Pt SSCs due to the low coordination, and a new descriptor, i.e., &#916;GH(4) (the adsorption energy of the 4th H), is figured out to evaluate the HER activities. Relative to C&#8208; coordinated Pt, N&#8208;coordinated Pt has higher reactivity due to the electron transfer of N&#8208;to&#8208;Pt, which enriches the density of states of Pt 5d orbital near the Fermi level and facilitates the capturing of protons, just the opposite to the situations for P&#8208; and S&#8208;coordinated ones. The stable N&#8208;coordinated Pt originates from the kinetic stability throughout the multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process. The experimental progress and theoretical understanding in this study provides a deep insight into the correlation of heteroatom coordination and hydrogen evolution, which is significant for the rational design of advanced Pt SSCs on carbon&#8208;based supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering NH2&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH2 Triple&#8208;atom Sites in Defective MOFs for Selective Overall Photoreduction of CO2 into CH3COCH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective photoreduction of CO2 to multicarbon products, is an important but challenging task, due to high CO2 activation barriers and insufficient catalytic sites for C&#8211;C coupling. Herein, a defect engineering strategy for incorporating copper sites into the connected nodes of defective metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for selective overall photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 into acetone. The Cu2+ site in well&#8208;modified CuN2O2 units served as a trapping site to capture electrons via efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, forming the active Cu+ site for CO2 reduction. Two NH2 groups in the CuN2O2 unit adsorb CO2 and cooperated with copper ion to functionalize as a triple atom catalytic site, each interacting with one CO2 molecule to strengthen the binding of *CO intermediate to catalytic site. The deoxygenated *CO attached to Cu site interacted with *CH3 fixed at one amino group to form the key intermediate CO*&#8208;CH3, which interacted with the third reduction intermediate on another amino group to produce acetone. Our photocatalyst realizes efficient overall CO2 reduction to C3 product acetone CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a selectivity up to 97% without any adducts, offering a promising avenue for designing triple&#8208;atomic sites to producing C3 product from photosynthesis with water.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanocloaks on Cancer Cells Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid system (LMP vaccine) that is based on living cancer cells and a manganese&#8208;phenolic nanocloak is developed for synergistic immunotherapy. The nanocloak affords an immunoactive exoskeleton by integrating the toll&#8208;like receptor ligand to enhance dendritic cell engulfment and Mn2+ ions to sensitize the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to superior therapeutic efficacy against melanoma.







Abstract
Due to the presence of natural neoantigens, autologous tumor cells hold great promise as personalized therapeutic vaccines. Yet autologous tumor cell vaccines require multi&#8208;step production that frequently leads to the loss of immunoreactive antigens, causing insufficient immune activation and significantly hampering their clinical applications. Herein, we introduce a novel whole&#8208;cell cancer vaccine by cloaking cancer cells with lipopolysaccharide&#8208;decorated manganese(II)&#8208;phenolic networks (MnTA nanocloaks) to evoke tumor&#8208;specific immune response for highly efficacious synergistic cancer immunotherapy. The natural polyphenols coordinate with Mn2+ and immediately adhere to the surface of individual cancer cells, thereby forming a nanocloak and encapsulating tumor neoantigens. Subsequent decoration with lipopolysaccharide induces internalization by dendritic cells, where Mn2+ ions are released in the cytosol, further facilitating the activation of the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway. Highly effective tumor suppression was observed by combining the nanocloaked cancer cell treatment with anti&#8208;programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) antibodies&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our work demonstrates a universal yet simple strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;based nanobiohybrid system for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Switching from Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Single Crystals for Low&#8208;Threshold Laser to Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence in Amorphous&#8208;Film for Highly Efficient OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly packed and well&#8208;faceted single&#8208;crystal microwires of tert&#8208;butylcarbazole difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (DtCzBF2) enabled thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and low&#8208;threshold microlasers. In contrast, its guest&#8208;host amorphous thin&#8208;films exhibited organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) with a PLQY up to 61&#8201;%, leading to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with external quantum efficiency approaching 18.6&#8201;%. This study opens possibilities of low&#8208;cost ORTP emitters for high performance OLEDs and future low&#8208;threshold electrically injected organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes containing Ir or Pt are work horse in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons in electroluminescence (EL) owing to strong heavy&#8208;atom effect. Recently, organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) have achieved high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in rigid crystalline state, which, however, is unsuitable for OLED fabrication, therefore leading to an EL efficiency far low behind those of metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes. Here, we reported a luminescence mechanism switch from thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in single crystal microwires to ORTP in amorphous thin&#8208;films, based on a tert&#8208;butylcarbazole difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate derivative of DtCzBF2. Tightly packed and well&#8208;faceted single&#8208;crystal microwires exhibit aggregation induced emission (AIE), enabling TADF microlasers at 473&#8197;nm with an optical gain coefficient as high as 852&#8197;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, loosely packed dimers of DtCzBF2 formed in guest&#8208;host amorphous thin&#8208;films decrease the oscillator strength of fluorescence transition but stabilize triplets for ORTP with a PLQY up to 61&#8201;%, leading to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with EQE approaching 20&#8201;%. This study opens possibilities of low&#8208;cost ORTP emitters for high performance OLEDs and future low&#8208;threshold electrically injected organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs).

Nucleic acid&#8208;based sensors unveil the DNA binding mechanisms of platinum(II) complexes. Based on signals generated at dual frequencies of square wave voltammetry upon introduction of platinum(II) antineoplastics, the sensors can resolve formation of monovalent adducts and bivalent adducts on the purine&#8208;rich DNA sequences.







Abstract
DNA crosslinking agents such as cisplatin and related platinum(II) analogs are effective drugs to treat solid tumors. However, these therapeutics can cause high toxicity in the body, and tumors can develop resistance to them. To develop less toxic and more effective DNA crosslinkers, medicinal chemists have focused on tuning the ligands in square planar platinum(II) complexes to modulate their bioavailability, targeted cell penetration, and DNA binding rates. Unfortunately, linking in vitro DNA binding capacity of DNA crosslinkers with their in vivo efficacy has proven challenging. Here we report an electrochemical biosensor strategy that allows the study of platinum(II)&#8208;DNA binding in real time. Our biosensors contain a purine&#8208;rich deoxynucleotide sequence, T6(AG)10, modified with a 5&#8217; hexylthiol linker for easy self&#8208;assembly onto gold electrodes. The 3&#8217; terminus is functionalized with the redox reporter methylene blue. Electron transfer from methylene blue to the sensor is a function of platinum(II) compound concentration and reaction time. Using these biosensors, we resolve DNA binding mechanisms including monovalent and bivalent binding, as well as base stacking. Our approach can measure DNA binding kinetics in buffers and in 50&#8201;% serum, offering a single&#8208;step, real&#8208;time approach to screen therapeutic compounds during drug development.

         <title>Dual Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Carbamoylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric nickel/metallaphotoredox catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H benzylic carbamoylation employing alkylarenes and isocyanates is described. A broad array of 2&#8208;arylamides can be prepared in one pot under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the rate and stereodetermining step of this transformation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated Hydrogen Atom Abstraction of Csp3&#8722;H bonds has become a powerful tool for the asymmetric functionalization of organic feedstocks. Here, we present an asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides via carbamoylation of alkylarenes with isocyanates as electrophiles. The synergistic combination of a photoredox and a chiral nickel&#8208;catalyst, enables the use of readily available and neutral reagents under mild reaction conditions and provides straightforward access to pharmacologically relevant motifs in enantiomerically pure form.

         <title>Design and Thermodynamics Principles to Program the Cooperativity of Molecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular assembly can be designed by fusing binding domains. A precise optimization of the level of compaction of the assembly using linker of different lengths or compositions can provide a simple strategy to program their assembly properties (e.g., midpoint, dynamic range, and inhibition). The thermodynamic and mechanistic principles demonstrated herein also shine light behind the evolution of biological molecular assembly.







Abstract
Most functional nanosystems in living organisms are constructed using multimeric assemblies that provide multiple advantages over their monomeric counterparts such as cooperative or anti&#8208;cooperative responses, integration of multiple signals and self&#8208;regulation. Inspired by these natural nanosystems, chemists have been synthesizing self&#8208;assembled supramolecular systems over the last 50&#8197;years with increasing complexity with applications ranging from biosensing, drug delivery, synthetic biology, and system chemistry. Although many advances have been made concerning the design principles of novel molecular architectures and chemistries, little is still known, however, about how to program their dynamic of assembly so that they can assemble at the required concentration and with the right sensitivity. Here, we used synthetic DNA assemblies and double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis to explore the thermodynamic basis to program the cooperativity of molecular assemblies. The results presented here exemplify how programmable molecular assemblies can be efficiently built by fusing interacting domains and optimizing their compaction. They may also provide the rational basis for understanding the thermodynamic and mechanistic principles driving the evolution of multimeric biological complexes.

         <title>Water&#8208;Degradable Oxygen&#8208;Rich Polymers with AB/ABB Units from Fast and Selective Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time report the copolymerization of formaldehyde and cyclic anhydride, which is fast and chemo&#8208;selective under mild conditions using common acids as catalysts. The versatile method yields a series of sustainable polymers with tunable AB/ABB units, which can be completely degraded into valuable diacids in water or seawater at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Researchers have been chasing plastics that can automatically and fully degrade into valuable products under natural conditions. Here, we develop a series of water&#8208;degradable polymers from the first reported fast and selective cationic copolymerization of formaldehyde (B) with cyclic anhydrides (A). In addition to readily accessible monomers, the method is performed at industrially relevant temperatures (~100&#8201;&#176;C), takes tens or even minutes, and uses common acid as the catalyst. Interestingly, such polymers possess tunable AB/ABB&#8208;type repeating units, which are considered to be thermodynamic and kinetic products, respectively, resulting in low carbon content ([O]&#8201;:&#8201;[C] up to 1&#8201;:&#8201;1). Notably, the polymers can completely degrade to valuable diacids within 150&#8197;days in water at ambient temperature owing to the incorporation of carboxyl terminals and acid&#8208;responsive acetal units. By washing with aqueous sodium carbonate, the polymers are relatively stable over several months.

         <title>Pulse Electrolysis Turns on CO2 Methanation through N&#8208;Confused Cupric Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulse potential electrolysis bolsters the methane selectivity on N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin by 3&#8208;fold through promoted water dissociation, aggrandized OH&#8722; consumption and thereby populated protons at high anodic bias.







Abstract
Breaking the D4h symmetry in the square&#8208;planar M&#8722;N4 configuration of macrocycle molecular catalysts has witnessed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, but at the expense of electrochemical stability. Herein, we hypothesize that the lability of the active Cu&#8722;N3 motifs in the N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CuNCP) could be overcome by applying pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE) during electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. We find that applying PPE can indeed enhance the CH4 selectivity on CuNCP by 3 folds to reach the partial current density of 170&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &gt;60&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in flow cell. However, combined ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR), Raman, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterizations reveal that, in a prolonged time scale, the decomplexation of CuNCP is unavoidable, and the promoted water dissociation under high anodic bias with lowered pH and enriched protons facilitates successive hydrogenation of *CO on the irreversibly reduced Cu nanoparticles, leading to the improved CH4 selectivity. As a key note, this study signifies the adaption of electrolytic protocol to the catalyst structure for tailoring local chemical environment towards efficient CO2 reduction.

         <title>Photoswitchable PROTACs for Reversible and Spatiotemporal Regulation of NAMPT and NAD+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first activator&#8208;based photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PS&#8208;PROTAC) was developed for the optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems. The novel PS&#8208;PROTAC enabled the reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+, resulting in a significant reduction in target&#8208;related toxicity compared to conventional NAMPT degraders or inhibitors. Furthermore, PS&#8208;PROTAC allowed for the in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT, and NAD+.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential coenzyme with diverse biological functions in DNA synthesis. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in mammals. We developed the first chemical tool for optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems using photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PS&#8208;PROTACs). An NAMPT activator and dimethylpyrazolazobenzene photoswitch were used to design highly efficient PS&#8208;PROTACs, enabling up&#8208; and down&#8208;reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+ in a light&#8208;dependent manner and reducing the toxicity associated with inhibitor&#8208;based PS&#8208;PROTACs. PS&#8208;PROTAC was activated under 620&#8197;nm irradiation, realizing in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT, and NAD+.

         <title>Coarse&#8208;Grained Model&#8208;Assisted Design of Polymer Prodrug Nanoparticles with Enhanced Cytotoxicity: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting relative drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation has been developed. This hypothesis was experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs, which demonstrated greater drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines.







Abstract
To achieve drug release from polymer prodrug nanoparticles, the drug&#8208;polymer linker must be accessible for cleavage to release the drug, which can occur under certain physiological conditions (e.g., presence of specific enzymes). Supramolecular organization of polymer prodrug nanoparticles is crucial as it greatly affects the location of the linker, its surface exposure/solvation and thus its cleavage to release the drug. Since experimental access to these data is not straightforward, new methodologies are critically needed to access this information and to accelerate the development of more effective polymer prodrug nanoparticles, and replace the time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategy. In this context, we reported here the use of a coarse&#8208;grained model to assist the design of polymer prodrug nanoparticles with enhanced cytotoxicity. By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, we developed an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation. Our hypothesis was then experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs (gemcitabine and paclitaxel), which demonstrated greater performances in terms of drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines. Interestingly, our methodology can be easily applied to other polymer prodrug structures, which would contribute to the development of more efficient drug delivery systems via in silico screening.

         <title>Cubic Iodide LixYI3+x Superionic Conductors through Defect Manipulation for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating defects within a highly symmetric iodide crystal has successfully yielded a remarkable ionic conductivity exceeding 1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature in a novel Li4YI7 solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This achievement not only demonstrates its promising compatibility with lithium metal but also enables the realization of high&#8208;performance iodide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide SEs receiving less attention. Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti&#8208;reduction stability, respectively. Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: LixYI3+x (x=2, 3, 4, or 9). Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the LixYI3+x SEs belong to the high&#8208;symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li&#8208;ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C for Li4YI7. Additionally, the promising Li&#8208;metal compatibility of Li4YI7 is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations. Our study on iodide SEs provides deep insights into the relation between high&#8208;symmetry halide structures and ionic conduction, which can inspire future efforts to revitalize halide SEs.

         <title>Global Reactivity Profiling of the Catalytic Lysine in Human Kinome for Covalent Inhibitor Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes based on aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) are reported, enabling successful profiling of &gt;300 endogenous kinases and providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the human kinome. Introduction of these aminophiles into a noncovalent Aurora A kinase inhibitor led to novel lysine&#8208;reactive inhibitors that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and cellular activities with prolonged residence time.







Abstract
Advances in targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) have been made by using lysine&#8208;reactive chemistries. Few aminophiles possessing balanced reactivity/stability for the development of cell&#8208;active TCIs are however available. We report herein lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; 2&#8211;14) based on the chemistry of aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) capable of global reactivity profiling of the catalytic lysine in human kinome from mammalian cells. We concurrently developed reversible covalent ABPs (15/16) by installing salicylaldehydes (SA) onto a promiscuous kinase&#8208;binding scaffold. The stability and amine reactivity of these probes exhibited a broad range of tunability. X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the successful covalent engagement between ArOSO2F on 9 and the catalytic lysine of SRC kinase. Chemoproteomic studies enabled the profiling of &gt;300 endogenous kinases, thus providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the kinome. By further introducing these aminophiles into VX&#8208;680 (a noncovalent inhibitor of AURKA kinase), we generated novel lysine&#8208;reactive TCIs that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and reasonable cellular activities with prolonged residence time. Our work serves as a general guide for the development of lysine&#8208;reactive ArOSO2F&#8208;based TCIs.

The small molecule RBS&#8208;10 exploits a novel synthetic lethal vulnerability in cancer cells that show widespread resistance to degraders.







Abstract
Degraders hold the promise to efficiently inactivate previously intractable disease&#8208;relevant targets. Unlike traditional inhibitors, degraders act substoichiometrically and rely on the hijacked proteolysis machinery, which can also act as an entry point for resistance. To fully harness the potential of targeted protein degradation, it is crucial to comprehend resistance mechanisms and formulate effective strategies to overcome them. We conducted a chemical screening to identify synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cancer cells that exhibit widespread resistance to degraders. Comparative profiling followed by tailored optimization delivered the small molecule RBS&#8208;10, which shows preferential cytotoxicity against cells pan&#8208;resistant to degraders. Multiomics deconvolution of the mechanism of action revealed that RBS&#8208;10 acts as a prodrug bioactivated by the oxidoreductase enzyme NQO1, which is highly overexpressed in our resistance models. Collectively, our work informs on NQO1 as an actionable vulnerability to overcome resistance to degraders and as a biomarker to selectively exploit bioactivatable prodrugs in cancer.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Regulated Cathode with Low Strain and Constraint Phase&#8208;Change Toward Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Al&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful implementation of an entropy&#8208;regulation approach is proposed by using PBAs as cathode for aqueous AIBs, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. As&#8208;designed medium&#8208;entropy cathode could deliver a high capacity for reversible Al3+ storage, which is attributed to the activation of numerous redox centres and low strain, further enabling ultra&#8208;high rates of ion storage and an exceptionally long lifespan.







Abstract
During multivalent ions insertion processes, intense electrostatic interaction between charge carriers and host makes the high&#8208;performance reversible Al3+ storage remains an elusive target. On account of the strong electrostatic repulsion and poor robustness, Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) suffer severely from the inevitable and large strain and phase change during reversible Al3+ insertion. Herein, we demonstrate an entropy&#8208;driven strategy to realize ultralong life aqueous Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) based on medium entropy PBAs (ME&#8208;PBAs) host. By multiple redox active centers introduction, the intrinsic poor conductivity can be enhanced simultaneously, resulting in outstanding capabilities of electrochemical Al3+ storage. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;occupation at metal sites in PBA frameworks can also increase the M&#8722;N bond intensity, which is beneficial for constraining the phase change during consecutive Al3+ reversible insertion, to realize an extended lifespan over 10,000 cycles. Based on the calculation at different operation states, the fluctuation of ME&#8208;PBA lattice parameters is only 1.2&#8201;%. Assembled with MoO3 anodes, the full cells can also deliver outstanding electrochemical properties. The findings highlight that, the entropy regulation strategy could uncover the isochronous constraint on both strain and phase transition for long&#8208;term reversible Al3+ storage, providing a promising design for advanced electrode materials for aqueous multivalent ions batteries.

         <title>The Reverse of Electrostatic Interaction Force for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy Al&#8208;Ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>

The electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8722;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8722;. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge, which is a breakthrough for achieving ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density aluminum&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries by tuning surface charge of electrode materials.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXenes with sufficient interlayer spacing are promising cathode materials for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), yet the electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8722;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8722; and is usually ignored. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge. By doping N and Co, the zeta potential is gradually transformed from negative (Ti3C2Tx) to near&#8208;neutral (Ti3CNTx), and finally positive (Ti3CNTx@Co). Therefore, the electrostatic repulsion force can be greatly weakened between Ti3CNTx and AlCl4&#8722;, or even formed a strong electrostatic attraction between Ti3CNTx@Co and AlCl4&#8722;, which can not only accommodate more AlCl4&#8722; ions in the Ti3CNTx@Co interlayers to increase the capacity, but also solve the stacking and expansion problems. As a result, the optimized Al&#8208;MXene battery exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of up to 240&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;4&#8197;times the capacity of graphite cathode, 60&#8211;120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a potential ultrahigh energy density (432&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, 2&#8211;4&#8197;times the value of graphite, 110&#8211;220&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) based on the mass of cathode materials, comparable to LiFePO4&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries (350&#8211;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the mass of LiFePO4).

         <title>Biodegradable Monometallic Aluminum as a Biotuner for Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable monometallic Al is used for the first time as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. Al reacts with H+ to form H2 and Al3+, which not only remodels the TME but also enables its degradation. H2 and Al3+ disrupt redox balance and ionic homeostasis, inducing the generation of abundant ROS, which activates ROS&#8208;responsive prodrugs, ultimately achieving efficient tumor therapy.







Abstract
Pyroptosis is an effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy. However, monometallic pyroptosis biotuners have not been explored until now. Here, we discover for the first time that biodegradable monometallic Al can act as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. pH&#8208;sensitive Al nanoparticles (Al@P) are obtained by equipping polyethylene glycol&#8208;b&#8208;(poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8208;co&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine), which can exert their effect at the tumor site without affecting normal cells. The H2 and Al3+ release by Al@P in the acidic environment of tumors disrupts the redox balance and ionic homeostasis in tumor cells, thus generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to caspase&#8208;1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage, and IL&#8208;1&#946;/LDH release, which induces canonical pyroptotic death. Meanwhile, the prodrug Doxorubicin (Pro&#8208;DOX) is successfully loaded onto Al@P (Al@P&#8208;P) and can be activated by ROS to release DOX in the tumor cells, thus further improving the tumor&#8208;killing efficiency. Ultimately, Al@P&#8208;P is degradable and exhibits efficient tumor inhibition.

         <title>The Structural Role of N170 in Substrate&#8208;Assisted Deacylation in KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;Lactamase</title>

Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) alter its structure and function and can lead to increased resistance to antibiotics. Accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations have now revealed that in D179 variants of KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;lactamase, the N170 side chain can rotate away from the active site, allowing the binding of antibiotics such as moxalactam and ceftazidime.







Abstract
The amino acid substitutions in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) that have arisen in the clinic are observed to lead to the development of resistance to ceftazidime&#8208;avibactam, a preferred treatment for KPC bearing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) result in changes in the structure and function of the enzyme, leading to alterations in substrate specificity, decreased stability, and more recently observed, increased resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam. Using accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations, we explored in detail the structural role of R164 and D179 variants that are described to confer ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. The buried conformation of D179 substitutions produce a pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop &#8208; more than R164 mutants, where the crystallographic omega loop structure remains mostly intact. Our findings also reveal that the conformation of N170 plays an underappreciated role impacting drug binding and restricting deacylation. The results further support the hypothesis that KPC&#8208;2 D179 variants employ substrate&#8208;assisted catalysis for ceftazidime hydrolysis, involving the ring amine of the aminothiazole group to promote deacylation and catalytic turnover. Moreover, the shift in the WT conformation of N170 contributes to reduced deacylation and an altered spectrum of enzymatic activity.

         <title>High&#8208;nuclearity Luminescent Lanthanide Nanocages for Tumor Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 60&#8208;metal lanthanide nanocages (Ln60, Ln=Eu and Tb) constructed from Schiff base ligands were used as molecular drug delivery agents (DOX@Ln60, DOX=doxorubicin). They provided for effective tumor therapy in a murine model with negligible side effects. Moreover, DOX@Ln60 proved luminescent and efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing these cells to be readily visualized.







Abstract
There is an unmet need for easy&#8208;to&#8208;visualize drug carriers that can deliver therapeutic cargoes deep into solid tumors. Herein, we report the preparation of ultrasmall luminescent imine&#8208;based lanthanide nanocages, Eu60 and Tb60 (collectively Ln60), designed to encapsulate anticancer chemotherapeutics for tumor therapy. The as&#8208;prepared nanocages possess large cavities suitable for the encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX), yielding DOX@Ln60 nanocages with diameters around 5&#8197;nm. DOX@Ln60 are efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing the cells to be visualized via the intrinsic luminescent property of Ln(III). Once internalized, the acidic intracellular microenvironment promotes imine bond cleavage and the release of the loaded DOX. DOX@Ln60 inhibits DNA replication and triggers tumor cell apoptosis. In a murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, DOX@Ln60 was found to inhibit tumor growth with negligible side effects on normal tissues. It proved more effective than various controls, including DOX and Ln60. The present nanocages thus point the way to the development of precise nanomedicines for tumor imaging and therapy.

         <title>Photoluminescence Quenching of Hydrophobic Ag29 Nanoclusters Caused by Molecular Decoupling during Aqueous Phase Transfer and EmissionRecovery through Supramolecular Recoupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the phase transfer of hydrophobic clusters into the aqueous phase with maintained emission intensities via the supramolecular recoupling of emissive Ag29 nanoclusters with atomic precision.







Abstract
Exploiting emissive hydrophobic nanoclusters for hydrophilic applications remains a challenge because of photoluminescence (PL) quenching during phase transfer. In addition, the mechanism underlying PL quenching remains unclear. In this study, the PL&#8208;quenching mechanism was examined by analyzing the atomically precise structures and optical properties of a surface&#8208;engineered Ag29 nanocluster with an all&#8208;around&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;functionalized surface. Specifically, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;triggered PL quenching was justified as molecular decoupling, which directed an unfixed cluster surface and weakened the radiative transition. Furthermore, emission recovery of the quenched nanoclusters was accomplished by using a supramolecular recoupling approach through the glutathione&#8208;addition&#8208;induced aggregation of cluster molecules, wherein the restriction of intracluster motion and intercluster rotation strengthened the radiative transition of the clusters. The results of this work offer a new perspective on structure&#8208;emission correlations for atomically precise nanoclusters and hopefully provide insight into the fabrication of highly emissive cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials for downstream hydrophilic applications.

         <dc:description>
A stress dissipation strategy driven by multi&#8208;interface BEFs and architected structure, is proposed to achieve compatibility between fast kinetics and structural stability in an anode. Based on this strategy, desert&#8208;rose&#8208;like HMI&#8208;MFS NRs with multiple interfaces and a staggered cantilever configuration at micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;scales are fabricated, which display ultrafast and superior long&#8208;term sodium ion storage in half/full SIBs.







Abstract
The kinetics and durability of conversion&#8208;based anodes greatly depend on the intrinsic stress regulating ability of the electrode materials, which has been significantly neglected. Herein, a stress dissipation strategy driven by multi&#8208;interface built&#8208;in electric fields (BEFs) and architected structure, is innovatively proposed to design ultrafast and long&#8208;term sodium ion storage anodes. Binary Mo/Fe sulfide heterostructured nanorods with multi&#8208;interface BEFs and staggered cantilever configuration are fabricated to prove our concept. Multi&#8208;physics simulations and experimental results confirm that the inner stress in multiple directions can be dissipated by the multi&#8208;interface BEFs at the micro&#8208;scale, and by the staggered cantilever structure at the macro&#8208;scale, respectively. As a result, our designed heterostructured nanorods anode exhibits superb rate capability (332.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and durable cyclic stability over 900 cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, outperforming other metal chalcogenides. This proposed stress dissipation strategy offers a new insight for developing stable structures for conversion&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Aziridines with Vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Vinyl Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general skeletal ring expansion strategy for the direct conversion of aziridines into 2&#8208;vinyl azetidines via one&#8208;carbon insertion using vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is described. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
Azetidines, being four&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value&#8208;added 2&#8208;alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step&#8208;economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds. The pivotal aspect of this successful transformation lies in the in situ formation of an alkenyl aziridinium ylide intermediate.

     alt="Rhodium-Catalyzed One-Carbon Ring Expansion of Aziridines with Vinyl-N-triftosylhydrazones for the Synthesis of 2-Vinyl Azetidines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general skeletal ring expansion strategy for the direct conversion of aziridines into 2-vinyl azetidines via one-carbon insertion using vinyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-triftosylhydrazones is described. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azetidines, being four-membered &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh-catalyzed one-carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value-added 2-alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one-pot two-step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step-economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds. The pivotal aspect of this successful transformation lies in the in situ formation of an alkenyl aziridinium ylide intermediate. Experimental investigations, coupled with computational studies, suggest that a diradical pathway is involved in the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Threading a Linear Molecule Through a Macrocycle Thanks to Boron: Optical Properties of the Threaded Species and Synthesis of a Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;containing species were threaded through macrocycles bearing a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol unit. The new threaded species exhibited interesting fluorescence features with quantum yields up to 91&#8201;% and an enhanced photostability. Their properties were rationalized with quantum chemistry to unravel the vibronic contributions. This methodology was used to synthesize a rotaxane.







Abstract
Two BODIPYs and two boron &#946;&#8208;diketonates were threaded through a macrocycle bearing a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol unit, showing thus the ability of boron to act as a gathering atom. The new threaded species were characterized by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as by X&#8208;ray crystallography for one of them and their properties rationalized with quantum chemistry to unravel the vibronic contributions. The BODIPYs exhibited interesting fluorescence features with quantum yields up to 91&#8201;% and enhanced photostability compared to their non&#8208;threaded homologues. A rotaxane was synthesized using this threading strategy after stoppering and removing the boron with potassium hydroxide.

         <title>Hygroscopic Solutes Enable Non&#8208;van der Waals Electrolytes for Fire&#8208;Tolerant Dual&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the irreversible thermal transformation of electrolytes is typically attributed to solvent boiling, which disrupts solvent intermolecular interactions, our research revealed that hygroscopic solutes shift the determining factor to solute decomposition, breaking solute intramolecular bonds. As intramolecular bonds are much stronger, it enables ultrahigh thermal tolerance of non&#8208;van der Waals solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes.







Abstract
Thermal safety issues of batteries have hindered their large&#8208;scale applications. Nonflammable electrolytes improved safety but solvent evaporation above 100&#8201;&#176;C limited thermal tolerance, lacking reliability. Herein, fire&#8208;tolerant metal&#8208;air batteries were realized by introducing solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes whose hygroscopic solutes could spontaneously reabsorb the evaporated water solvent. Using Zn/CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air/carbon batteries as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, they failed upon burning at 631.8&#8201;&#176;C but self&#8208;recovered then by reabsorbing water from the air at room temperature. Different from conventional aqueous electrolytes whose irreversible thermal transformation is determined by the boiling points of solvents, solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes make this transformation determined by the much higher decomposition temperature of solutes. It was found that stronger intramolecular bonds instead of intermolecular (van der Waals) interactions were strongly correlated to ultra&#8208;high tolerance temperatures of our solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes. Our study would improve the understanding of the thermal properties of electrolytes, guide the design of solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, and enhance battery safety.

         <title>Operando Mobile Catalysis for Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>

Operando mobile catalysis enables the formation of mobile metal species during the reaction and enhances the catalytic efficiency by increasing the collision probability with the intermediates.







Abstract
Metal atoms on the support serve as active sites for many heterogeneous catalysts. However, the active metal sites on the support are conventionally described as static, and the intermediates adsorbed on the support far away from the active metal sites cannot be transformed. Herein, we report the first example of operando mobile catalysis to promote catalytic efficiency by enhancing the collision probability between active sites and reactants or reaction intermediates. Specifically, ligand&#8208;coordinated Pt single atoms (isolated MeCpPt&#8208; species) are bonded on CeO2 and transformed into mobile MeCpPt(H)CO complexes during the reverse water gas shift reaction for operando mobile catalysis. This strategy enables the conversion of inert carbonate intermediates on the CeO2 support. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 6358&#8197;mol&#8197;CO2&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 99&#8201;% CO selectivity at 300&#8201;&#176;C is obtained for reverse water gas shift reaction, dramatically higher than those of Pt catalysts reported in the literature. Operando mobile catalysis presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions and applications.

Asymmetric acceptor DT&#8208;C8Cl with functional haloalkyl chains was designed and synthesized, where noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively optimize the morphology and suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions, leading to simultaneously enhanced efficiency and morphology stability of organic solar cells.







Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) for commercialization remains a challenging task. Herein, we designed asymmetric acceptors DT&#8208;C8Cl and DT&#8208;C8BTz with functional haloalkyl chains, in which the halogen atoms could induce noncovalent interactions with heteroatoms like O, S, and Se, etc., thus leading to appropriately manipulated film morphology. Consequently, binary devices based on D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.40&#8201;%. The higher PCE of D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl could be attributed to the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses. In addition, the noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions and thereby reduce trap density of states, leading to improved thermal and storage stability. Overall, our findings reveal that the rational design of asymmetric acceptors with functional haloalkyl chains is a novel and powerful strategy for simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of OSCs.

We report an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents capable of simultaneously oxidizing tetrahydrobiopterin and generating superoxide radicals.







Abstract
We herein present an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. As a proof of concept, BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers were rationally designed and prepared. The photo&#8208;induced intermolecular electron transfer between homotypic chromophores leads to the disproportionation reaction, resulting in the formation of charged intermediates, cationic and anionic radicals. The cationic radicals efficiently oxidize the cellularimportant coenzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and the anionic radicals transfer electrons to oxygen to produce superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8901;). One of our Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents not only self&#8208;assembles in water but also effectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum. It displayed excellent photocytotoxicity even in highly hypoxic environments (2&#8201;% O2), with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.96&#8197;&#956;M, and demonstrated outstanding antitumor efficacy in murine models bearing HeLa tumors.

         <title>A Semisynthesis Platform for the Efficient Production and Exploration of Didemnin&#8208;Based Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform has been established for the exploration of didemnin&#8208;based drugs, combining microbial synthesis of didemnin B through genetic engineering of Tistrella mobilis and semisynthesis for the production of plitidepsin for drug purposes, didemnin derivatives for studying structure&#8211;activity relationships, and didemnin B probes for targeted protein profiling. This sustainable approach holds potential for investigating other marine natural products.







Abstract
Plitidepsin (or dehydrodidemnin B), an approved anticancer drug, belongs to the didemnin family of cyclic depsipeptides, which are found in limited quantities in marine tunicate extracts. Herein, we introduce a new approach that integrates microbial and chemical synthesis to generate plitidepsin and its analogues. We screened a Tistrella strain library to identify a potent didemnin B producer, and then introduced a second copy of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster into its genome, resulting in a didemnin B titer of approximately 75&#8197;mg/L. Next, we developed two straightforward chemical strategies to convert didemnin B into plitidepsin, one of which involved a one&#8208;step synthetic route giving over 90&#8201;% overall yield. Furthermore, we synthesized 13 new didemnin derivatives and three didemnin probes, enabling research into structure&#8211;activity relationships and interactions between didemnin and proteins. Our study highlights the synergistic potential of biosynthesis and chemical synthesis in overcoming the challenge of producing complex natural products sustainably and at scale.

         <title>N&#8208;Cyanopiperazines as Specific Covalent Inhibitors of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme UCHL1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanopiperazines as covalent enzyme inhibitors are disclosed. Extending on cyanopyrrolidines, reported cyanamides made of 6&#8208;membered rings display context&#8208;dependent reversibility and exquisite specificity for the deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL1 among human DUBs and the protein deglycase DJ&#8208;1/PARK7. Their mechanism of specificity is rationalized by a crystal structure, highlighting how protein reactivity of electrophilic compounds can be finetuned.







Abstract
Cyanamides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in covalent inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross&#8208;reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ&#8208;1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl,N&#8208;cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with effective target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5&#8208;membered pyrrolidines to 6&#8208;membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context&#8208;dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound&#8208;induced conformational restriction of the cross&#8208;over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.

This mild method features high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity and was used to generate 30 highly functionalized substituted dihydroquinoxalines in 36&#8211;98&#8201;% yield. This transformation was also carried asymmetrically using phthalazinamine&#8208;based chiral ligand to provide 9&#8197;chiral addition products in 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 to 86&#8201;:&#8201;14 e.r. The experimental and quantum chemical explorations of this reaction suggest a mechanism that involves Ir(III)&#8208;catalyzed triplet energy transfer followed by a ring&#8208;opening reaction ultimately leading to the formation of azomethine ylide intermediates. These azomethine intermediates undergo sequential protonation/copper(I) acetylide addition to provide the products.

         <title>Controlling Monoterpene Isomerization by Guiding Challenging Carbocation Rearrangement Reactions in Engineered Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbocation&#8208;based rearrangements are vital for terpene versatility. AacSHC triterpene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius acted as a promiscuous catalyst for multiple monoterpene rearrangements. Tailored AacSHC variants directed the specific isomerization of pinene with exceptional selectivities. Success involved restructuring the aromatic active pocket and reorganizing water clusters to stabilize demanding carbocationic intermediates.







Abstract
The interconversion of monoterpenes is facilitated by a complex network of carbocation rearrangement pathways. Controlling these isomerization pathways is challenging when using common Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid catalysts, which often produce product mixtures that are difficult to separate. In contrast, natural monoterpene cyclases exhibit high control over the carbocation rearrangement reactions but are reliant on phosphorylated substrates. In this study, we present engineered squalene&#8208;hopene cyclases from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AacSHC) that catalyze the challenging isomerization of monoterpenes with unprecedented precision. Starting from a promiscuous isomerization of (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;pinene, we first demonstrate noticeable shifts in the product distribution solely by introducing single point mutations. Furthermore, we showcase the tuneable cation steering by enhancing (+)&#8208;borneol selectivity from 1&#8201;% to &gt;90&#8201;% (&gt;99&#8201;% de) aided by iterative saturation mutagenesis. Our combined experimental and computational data suggest that the reorganization of key aromatic residues leads to the restructuring of the water network that facilitates the selective termination of the secondary isobornyl cation. This work expands our mechanistic understanding of carbocation rearrangements and sets the stage for target&#8208;oriented skeletal reorganization of broadly abundant terpenes.

Furthermore, we showcase the tuneable cation steering by enhancing (+)-borneol selectivity from 1&#8201;% to &amp;gt;90&#8201;% (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;de&lt;/i&gt;) aided by iterative saturation mutagenesis. Our combined experimental and computational data suggest that the reorganization of key aromatic residues leads to the restructuring of the water network that facilitates the selective termination of the secondary isobornyl cation. This work expands our mechanistic understanding of carbocation rearrangements and sets the stage for target-oriented skeletal reorganization of broadly abundant terpenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;state Conversion by Asymmetrical Orbital Hybridization in Ni&#8208;doped Co3O4 to Boost Singlet Oxygen Generation for Microbial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of Ni into the octahedral site of Co3O4 effectively induced a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition, thereby enhancing the activity of 1O2 generation. We further explored the spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions between the catalysts and intermediates, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the 1O2 generation. This work deepens the understanding about orbital interactions and spin states.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a significant role in environmental and biomedical disinfection fields. Electrocatalytic processes hold great potential for 1O2 generation, but remain challenging. Herein, a facile Ni doping converted spin&#8208;state transition approach is reported for boosting 1O2 production. Magnetic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that Ni occupied at the octahedral site of Co3O4 can effectively induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8722;Co3O4 generate appropriate binding strength and enhance electron transfer between the Co centers with oxygen intermediates, thereby improving the catalytic activity of Ni&#8722;Co3O4 for effective generating 1O2. In neutral conditions, 1&#215;106&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 Gram&#8208;negative ESBL&#8208;producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) could be inactivated by Ni&#8722;Co3O4 system within 5&#8197;min. Further antibacterial mechanisms indicate that 1O2 can lead to cell membrane damage and DNA degradation so as to irreversible cell death. Additionally, the developed Ni&#8722;Co3O4 system can effectively inactivate bacteria from wastewater and bioaerosols. This work provides an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;spin electrocatalysis to boost 1O2 generation for disinfection process.

         <title>A Potentiometric Dual&#8208;Channel Microsensor Reveals that Fluctuation of H2S is Less pH&#8208;Dependent During Spreading Depolarization in the Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the mechanism of spreading depolarization (SD) is essential for the therapy of SD associated diseases. We report a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous detection of H2S and pH, enabling the first observation of H2S fluctuation induced by SD in vivo. Our work provides the direct experimental evidence that the H2S release during SD in rat cortex is less pH&#8208;dependent, possibly by modulating enzyme&#8208;dependent pathways.







Abstract
Spreading depolarization (SD) is one of the most common neuropathologic phenomena in the nervous system, relating to numerous diseases. However, real&#8208;time monitoring the rapid chemical changes during SD to probe the molecular mechanism remains a great challenge. We develop a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous monitoring of H2S and pH featuring excellent selectivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Using this microsensor we first observe real time changes of H2S and pH in the rat brain induced by SD. This changes of H2S are completely suppressed when the rat pre&#8208;treats with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a blocker to inhibit the H2S&#8208;producing enzyme, indicating H2S fluctuation might be related to enzyme&#8208;dependent pathway during SD and less pH&#8208;dependent. This study provides a new perspective for studying the function of H2S and the molecular basis of SD&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Dopants Induce Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Triarylamine Boronate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purely organic luminescent material TBBU does not show room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state even under N2. When doped with 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% DTBU, a persistent yellowish green afterglow can be observed from this binary system in N2 atmosphere. This induced phosphorescence is quite sensitive to oxygen, making the material a candidate for oxygen sensing.







Abstract
Purely organic materials exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising candidates for oxygen sensors and information encryption owing to their cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly nature. Herein, we report a bimolecular RTP system where DTBU acts as the guest and TBBU serves as the host. In contrast to previously reported results, we find that both pure DTBU and TBBU do not exhibit RTP in the solid state even under N2 atmosphere. A DTBU/TBBU system with a low doping ratio (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) exhibits persistent yellowish&#8208;green afterglow with a lifetime of 340&#8197;ms and is highly sensitive to oxygen. A DTBU/TBBU system with a higher doping ratio (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) maintains a phosphorescence lifetime of 179&#8197;ms under air. Applications of DTBU/TBBU at varied doping ratios in both oxygen sensing and information encryption are demonstrated. We propose that the T1 state of TBBU acts as an energy transfer intermediate between Tn and T1 of DTBU, ultimately leading to the generation of persistent RTP. Overall, this work demonstrates the critical importance of material purity in the design of RTP systems, and how an understanding of host&#8211;guest doping enables their photophysical properties to be precisely tuned.

The direct, triisopropy silyl triflate (TIPSOTf)&#8208;mediated, regioselective and stereodivergent Michael additions of thioimides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel complexes give any of the potential syn and anti diastereomers, at will, with good to high yields. The resultant adducts can be easily transformed into a wide array of enantiomerically pure intermediates ready to participate in the asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Direct and stereodivergent Michael additions of N&#8208;acyl 1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes are reported. The reactions proceed with a remarkable regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, so access to any of the four potential Michael stereoisomers is granted through the appropriate choice of the chiral ligand of the nickel(II) complex. Simple removal of the heterocyclic scaffold furnishes a wide array of either syn or anti enantiomerically pure derivatives, which can be exploited for the asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds, as demonstrated in a new approach to tapentadol. In turn, a mechanism, based on theoretical calculations, is proposed to account for the stereochemical outcome of these transformations.

         <title>A New Life For Nitrile&#8208;Butadiene Rubber: Co&#8208;Harnessing Metathesis And Condensation For Reincorporation Into Bio&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key polymer material, nitrile&#8208;butadiene rubber (NBR), is converted under mild conditions via a one&#8208;pot catalytic sequence to bio&#8208;based polyesters with highly modulable structure and properties. The overall process operates with high atom&#8208;economy, formally redistributing the NBR monomers into new difunctional monomers as well as a single valuable small molecule by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Efficient plastic recycling processes are crucial for the production of value&#8208;added products or intermediates. Here, we present a multicatalytic route that allows the degradation of nitrile&#8208;butadiene rubber, cross&#8208;metathesis of the formed oligomers, and polymerization of the resulting dicarboxylic acids with bio&#8208;based diols, providing direct access to unsaturated polyesters. This one&#8208;pot approach combines the use of commercially available catalysts that are active and selective under mild conditions to synthesize renewable copolymers without the need to isolate intermediates.

         <title>Molecular Crystals Constructed by Polar Molecular Cages: A Promising System for Exploring High&#8208;performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular crystals with polar molecular cages were firstly proposed as a promising system for exploring superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, the binary chalcogenide family P4Sn (n=3&#8211;9), is introduced. As a member of the system, &#945;&#8208;P4S5 possesses a robust SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), a broad band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), ample birefringence (0.134@2050 nm), a wide optical transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m), and exceptional water&#8208;resistance.







Abstract
Polar molecular crystals, with their densely stacked polar nonlinear optical (NLO) active units, are favored for their large second harmonic generation (SHG) responses and birefringence. However, their potential for practical applications as Infrared (IR) NLO materials has historically been underappreciated due to the weak inter&#8208;molecular interaction forces that may compromise their physicochemical properties. In this study, we propose molecular crystals with polar molecular cages as a treasure&#8208;house for the development of superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, binary chalcogenide molecular crystals, composed of [P4Sn] (n=3&#8211;9) polar molecular cages, is introduced. These crystals may not only achieve wide band gap, large SHG response, and birefringence in a single structure, but also exhibit favorable physicochemical properties. We subsequently obtained a polar molecular crystal, &#945;&#8208;P4S5, which demonstrated exceptional IR optical properties, including a strong SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), wide band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), large birefringence (0.134@2050&#8197;nm), and a broad transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m). Moreover, it showed excellent water resistance and hardness. These findings highlight the potential of polar molecular crystals as a promising platform for the development of high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

         <title>Dual Stimuli&#8208;Responsive [2]Rotaxanes with Tunable Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission and Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of novel [2]rotaxanes endows them with both tunable vibration&#8208;induced emission and switchable circularly polarized luminescence, providing a novel platform for the construction of smart chiral luminescent materials for practical use.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent system with precisely tunable emissions, the typical 9,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,14&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a, c]phenazine (DPAC) luminogen with attractive vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) behavior has been introduced into [2]rotaxane as a stopper. Taking advantage of their unique dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness towards solvent and anion, the resultant [2]rotaxanes reveal both tunable VIE and switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Attributed to the formation of mechanical bonds, DPAC&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxanes display interesting VIE behaviors including white&#8208;light emission upon the addition of viscous solvent, as evaluated in detail by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra. In addition, ascribed to the regulation of chirality information transmission through anion&#8208;induced motions of chiral wheel, the resolved chiral [2]rotaxanes reveal unique switchable CPL upon the addition of anion, leading to significant increase in the dissymmetry factors (glum) values with excellent reversibility. Interestingly, upon doping the chiral [2]rotaxanes in stretchable polymer, the blend films reveal remarkable emission change from white light to light blue with significant 6.5&#8208;fold increase in glum values up to &#8722;0.035 under external tensile stresses. This work provides not only a new design strategy for developing molecular systems with fluorescent tunability but also a novel platform for the construction of smart chiral luminescent materials for practical use.

         <title>Dynamically Modulating the Dissymmetry Factor of Circularly Polarized Organic Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Soft Helical Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an effective strategy for achieving circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with a high dissymmetry factor based on a bilayered soft helical superstructure doped with a light&#8208;driven molecular motor and room&#8208;temperature polymer layer. This enables the significant modulation of reflection across a wide spectral range and the dynamic controlling the dissymmetry factor of CP&#8208;OURTP from 1.38 to 0.60.







Abstract
Achieving circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with a high luminescent dissymmetry factor (glum) is crucial for diverse optoelectronic applications. In particular, dynamically controlling the dissymmetry factor of CP&#8208;OURTP can profoundly advance these applications, but it is still unprecedented. This study introduces an effective strategy to achieve photoirradiation&#8208;driven chirality regulation in a bilayered structure film, which consists of a layer of soft helical superstructure incorporated with a light&#8208;driven molecular motor and a layer of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer. The prepared bilayered film exhibits CP&#8208;OURTP with an emission lifetime of 805&#8197;ms and a glum value up to 1.38. Remarkably, the glum value of the resulting CP&#8208;OURTP film can be reversibly controlled between 0.6 and 1.38 over 20&#8197;cycles by light irradiation, representing the first example of dynamically controlling the glum in CP&#8208;OURTP.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Functional Small Molecules into Nanoparticles: Assembly and Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly approach is presented whereby a library of functional small molecules, encompassing anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores, are assembled into functional metal&#8211;phenolic network nanoparticles (FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under ambient conditions. These FSM&#8208;MPN NPs have potential use in a range of biological applications.







Abstract
Small molecules, including therapeutic drugs and tracer molecules, play a vital role in biological processing, disease treatment and diagnosis, and have inspired various nanobiotechnology approaches to realize their biological function, particularly in drug delivery. Desirable features of a delivery system for functional small molecules (FSMs) include high biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and simple manufacturing processes, without the need for chemical modification of the FSM itself. Herein, we report a simple and versatile approach, based on metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly, for assembling FSMs into nanoparticles (i.e., FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under aqueous and ambient conditions. We demonstrate loading of anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores at up to ~80&#8201;% that is mostly facilitated by &#960; and hydrophobic interactions between the FSM and nanoparticle components. Secondary nanoparticle engineering involving coating with a polyphenol&#8211;antibody thin film or sequential co&#8208;loading of multiple FSMs enables cancer cell targeting and combination delivery, respectively. Incorporating fluorophores into FSM&#8208;MPN NPs enables the visualization of biodistribution at different time points, revealing that most of these NPs are retained in the kidney and heart 24&#8197;h post intravenous administration. This work provides a viable pathway for the rational design of small molecule nanoparticle delivery platforms for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Radical Cation Salts of Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls: Polar Crystals, Negative Thermal Expansion and Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocrystallization of hetera&#8208;buckybowl trichalcogenasumanenes (TCSs) has afforded radical cation salts with excellent stability under ambient conditions. The resulting salts are mostly polar crystals, where the TCSs are partially charged and form columnar stacks. A reversible semiconductor&#8208;to&#8208;semiconductor phase transition is observed, which is caused by a negative thermal expansion of the unit cell.







Abstract
Radical cation salts of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles are rich in physical properties. Herein, two kinds of hetera&#8208;buckybowls, ethoxy&#8208;substituted trithiasumanene (3SEt) and triselenasumanene (3SeEt), are synthesized as electron donors. Galvanostatic oxidation of them affords radical cation salts (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SeEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SEt)4PMA, and (3SeEt)4PMA, where PMA is Keggin&#8208;type phosphomolybdate and TTFMPB is tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenyl]borate. In these salts, 3SEt/3SeEt are partially charged and show distinct conformation change with the site charge and counter anions. In TTFMPB salts, (TTFMPB)&#8722; forms hexagonal channels that accommodate the packing columns of 3SEt/3SeEt. In particular, (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3 adopts the R3c space group and is a polar crystal with the columns of 3SEt all in the up&#8208;bowl direction. The PMA salts of 3SEt/3SeEt are polar crystals (C2 space group) with 3SEt/3SeEt being planar and forming columnar stacks. (3SeEt)4PMA shows a structural modulation below 200&#8197;K, namely, negative thermal expansion (NTE) of the unit cell volume and enlargement of the intermolecular distances between neighboring 3SeEt molecules. The four salts are semiconductors with an activation energy of 0.18&#8211;0.38&#8197;eV. The conductivity of (3SeEt)4PMA shows a reversible transition upon cooling and heating, in accordance to the NTE structural modulation. This work paves the way toward conducting materials based on hetera&#8208;buckybowls.

         <title>Artificial LiF&#8208;Rich Interface Enabled by In situ Electrochemical Fluorination for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

An artificial LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface formed by a fluorinated carbon nanotube macrofilm endows stable Li&#8208;metal batteries with long lifetimes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. One drawback of uncontrollable electrolyte degradation is the ability to form a fragile and nonuniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI). In this study, we propose the use of a fluorinated carbon nanotube (CNT) macrofilm (CMF) on Li metal as a hybrid anode, which can regulate the redox state at the anode/electrolyte interface. Due to the favorable reaction energy between the plated Li and fluorinated CNTs, the metal can be fluorinated directly to a LiF&#8208;rich SEI during the charging process, leading to a high Young's modulus (~2.0&#8197;GPa) and fast ionic transfer (~2.59&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The obtained SEI can guide the homogeneous plating/stripping of Li during electrochemical processes while suppressing dendrite growth. In particular, the hybrid of endowed full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability allows for high capacity retention (~99.3&#8201;%) and remarkable rate capacity. This work can extend fluorination technology into a platform to control artificial SEI formation in Li&#8208;metal batteries, increasing the stability and long&#8208;term performance of the resulting material.

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Loss of Fast Charging Capability in Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon extended cycling, the presence of microcracks and resulting internal degradation lead to the hindered kinetics during the (de)intercalation of Li+ ions. While these issues were not problematic during charging at low currents, fast charging conditions induce electrochemically unreactive regions in the cathodes owing to increased resistance and polarization, which lead to the loss of fast charging.







Abstract
Fast charging technology for electric vehicles (EVs), offering rapid charging times similar to conventional vehicle refueling, holds promise but faces obstacles owing to kinetic issues within lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Specifically, the significance of cathode materials in fast charging has grown because Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are employed to enhance the energy density of LIBs. Herein, the mechanism behind the loss of fast charging capability of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during extended cycling is investigated through a comparative analysis of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with different microstructures. The results revealed that microcracks and the resultant cathode deterioration significantly compromised the fast charging capability over extended cycling. When thick rocksalt impurity phases form throughout the particles owing to electrolyte infiltration via microcracks, the limited kinetics of Li+ ions create electrochemically unreactive areas under high&#8208;current conditions, resulting in the loss of fast charging capability. Hence, preventing microcrack formation by tailoring microstructures is essential to ensure stability in fast charging capability. Understanding the relationship between microcracks and the loss of fast charging capability is essential for developing Ni&#8208;rich cathodes that facilitate stable fast charging upon extended cycling, thereby promoting widespread EV adoption.

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Hierarchical Porous &#960;&#8208;stacked Supermolecular Spring Frameworks from Aromatic Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical porous aromatic chiral cage&#8208;based &#960;OF with spring&#8208;like structure presents outstanding elasticity and reversible pressure&#8208;dependent emission with high&#8208;contrast emission difference over a wide pressure range.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials that exhibit pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence variations are attracting interest with wide potential applications in mechanical sensors, anticounterfeiting and storage devices. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied in piezochromism for highly tunable luminescence. Nevertheless, reversible and high&#8208;contrast emission response with a wide pressure range is still challenging. Herein, the first example of hierarchical porous cage&#8208;based &#960;OF (Cage&#8208;&#960;OF&#8208;1) with spring structure was synthesized by using aromatic chiral cages as building blocks.

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical porous aromatic chiral cage-based &#960;OF with spring-like structure presents outstanding elasticity and reversible pressure-dependent emission with high-contrast emission difference over a wide pressure range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piezochromic materials that exhibit pressure-dependent luminescence variations are attracting interest with wide potential applications in mechanical sensors, anticounterfeiting and storage devices. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied in piezochromism for highly tunable luminescence. Nevertheless, reversible and high-contrast emission response with a wide pressure range is still challenging. Herein, the first example of hierarchical porous cage-based &#960;OF (&lt;b&gt;Cage&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;&#960;OF&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with spring structure was synthesized by using aromatic chiral cages as building blocks. Its elastic properties evaluated based on the bulk modulus (9.5&#8197;GPa) is softer than most reported CPMs and the collapse point (20.0&#8197;GPa) significantly exceeds ever reported CPMs. As smart materials, &lt;b&gt;Cage&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;&#960;OF&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; displays linear pressure-dependent emission and achieves a high-contrast emission difference up to 154&#8197;nm. Pressure-responsive limit is up to 16&#8197;GPa, outperforming the CPMs reported so far. Dedicated experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions-dominated controllable structural shrinkage and porous-spring-structure-mediated elasticity is responsible for the outstanding piezofluorochromism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1D Covalent Organic Frameworks Triggering Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of H2O2 via Controllable Modular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence of novel VIA group elements (O, S, Se)&#8208;bridged 1D COFs with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology were synthesized and applied as catalysts in the photosynthesis of H2O2. Thanks to their 1D configurations, more active sites are accessible, the proton interlaminar shuttle are accelerated, and the directional transfer of electrons is also improved. The bridge&#8208;atoms (O, S, Se) in the 1D COFs play a crucial role for the catalytic activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The topological diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables considerable space for exploring their structure&#8208;performance relationships. In this study, we report a sequence of novel 1D COFs (EO, ES, and ESe&#8208;COF) with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology that can be interconnected with VIA group elements (O, S, and Se) via a modular design strategy. It is found that the electronic structures, charge delivery property, light harvesting ability, and hydrophilicity of these 1D COFs can be profoundly influenced by the bridge&#8208;linked atom ordinal. Finally, EO&#8208;COF, possessing the highest quantity of active sites, the longest lifetime of the active electron, the strongest interaction with O2, and the lowest energy barrier of O2 reduction, exhibits exceptional photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 activity under visible light, with a production rate of 2675&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high apparent quantum yield of 6.57&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. This is the first systematic report on 1D COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis, which enriches the topological database in reticular chemistry and promotes the exploration of structure&#8208;catalysis correlation.

         <title>Deciphering Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Towards CO2 Electroreduction over SnO2 by A Standard Research Paradigm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standard research paradigm proposed to uncover the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over SnO2, illustrating the surface reconstruction induced by oxygen vacancies (1/1&#8197;ML coverage) and surface&#8208;active species (Sn layer) accountable for selective HCOOH production. This proposed methodology validated by the experimental CO2RR is appliable to other electrocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Authentic surface structures under reaction conditions determine the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, therefore, the knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship can facilitate the design of efficient catalyst structures for specific reactivity requirements. However, understanding the relationship between a more realistic active surface and its performance is challenging due to the complicated interface microenvironment in electrocatalysis. Herein, we proposed a standard research paradigm to effectively decipher the structure&#8208;activity relationship in electrocatalysis, which is exemplified in the CO2 electroreduction over SnO2. The proposed practice has aided in discovering authentic/resting surface states (Sn layer) of SnO2 accountable for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance under electrocatalytic conditions, which then is corroborated in the subsequent CO2RR experiments over SnO2 with different morphologies (nanorods, nanoparticles, and nanosheets) in combination with in situ characterizations. This proposed methodology is further extended to the SnO electrocatalysts, providing helpful insights into catalytic structures. It is believed that our proposed standard research paradigm is also applicable to other electrocatalytic systems, in the meantime, decreases the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and accelerates the design of catalyst structures that achieve sustainable performance for energy conversion.

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Specific Dual Modification of Peptides through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of peptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, affording the chemically robust pyrrolidine ring in excellent yields with complete exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific introduction of multiple components into peptides is greatly needed for the preparation of densely functionalized and structurally uniform peptides. In this regard, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific peptide modification is attractive, but it can be difficult due to the presence of highly nucleophilic lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine. In this work, we developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of iminopeptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, thus affording the cycloadducts in excellent yields. Tolerating a broad range of functional groups and molecules, the present method provides the opportunity to rapidly construct doubly functionalized peptides using readily accessible aldehyde and maleimide modules.

         <title>Tailoring Na+ Solvation Environment and Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases with Sn(OTf)2 Additive in Non&#8208;flammable Phosphate Electrolytes towards Safe and Efficient Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2), is proposed to engineer a non&#8208;flammable triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based electrolyte, aiming to regulate the solvation environment of Na+, facilitate uniform Na deposition, and suppress the shuttling of sodium polysulfides for safe and efficient room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are promising for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, these batteries are plagued by safety concerns due to the highly flammable nature of conventional electrolytes. Although non&#8208;flammable electrolytes eliminate the risk of fire, they often result in compromised battery performance due to poor compatibility with sodium metal anode and sulfur cathode. Herein, we develop an additive of tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2) in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes to improve the cycling stability of RT Na&#8208;S batteries via modulating the Na+ solvation environment and interface chemistry. The additive reduces the Na+ desolvation energy and enhances the electrolyte stability. Moreover, it facilitates the construction of Na&#8208;Sn alloy&#8208;based anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). These interphases help to suppress the growth of Na dendrites and the dissolution/shuttling of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), resulting in improved reversible capacity. Specifically, the Na&#8208;S battery with the designed electrolyte boosts the capacity from 322 to 906&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides valuable insights for the development of safe and high&#8208;performance electrolytes in RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

Herein, we develop an additive of tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in non-flammable phosphate electrolytes to improve the cycling stability of RT Na-S batteries via modulating the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation environment and interface chemistry. The additive reduces the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation energy and enhances the electrolyte stability. Moreover, it facilitates the construction of Na-Sn alloy-based anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). These interphases help to suppress the growth of Na dendrites and the dissolution/shuttling of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), resulting in improved reversible capacity. Specifically, the Na-S battery with the designed electrolyte boosts the capacity from 322 to 906&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides valuable insights for the development of safe and high-performance electrolytes in RT Na-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable DNAzyme for the Sensitive Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unimolecular self&#8208;locked allosteric DNAzyme biosensor (named SPOT) is developed to enable sensitive detection (LOD: fM&#8208;aM) of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids in a one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step, preamplification&#8208;free, isothermal detection manner. SPOT exhibits potent performance on miRNA&#8208;based detection for cancer diagnostics and viral RNA&#8208;based detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection diagnostics.







Abstract
Nucleic acids in biofluids are emerging biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics of diseases, but their clinical use has been hindered by the lack of sensitive detection assays. Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop&#8208;initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one&#8208;stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost&#8208;effective detection of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.

         <title>2D Metal/Graphene and 2D Metal/Graphene/Metal Systems for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong covalent bonding between metal monolayer and graphene driven by the sp and d orbital hybridization, 2D metal/graphene (M/G) system is investigated. The charge transfer from metal to graphene allows for the electrodeposition of another metal film, thus forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) system. These 2D hybrid systems exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward formic acid production over competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Efficiently transforming CO2 into renewable energy sources is crucial for decarbonization efforts. Formic acid (HCOOH) holds great promise as a hydrogen storage compound due to its high hydrogen density, non&#8208;toxicity, and stability under ambient conditions. However, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) on conventional carbon black&#8208;supported metal catalysts faces challenges such as low stability through dissolution and agglomeration, as well as suffering from high overpotentials and the necessity to overcome the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we modify the physical/chemical properties of metal surfaces by depositing metal monolayers on graphene (M/G) to create highly active and stable electrocatalysts. Strong covalent bonding between graphene and metal is induced by the hybridization of sp and d orbitals, especially the sharp 
, 
, and 
 orbitals of metals near the Fermi level, playing a decisive role. Moreover, charge polarization on graphene in M/G enables the deposition of another thin metallic film, forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) structures. Finally, evaluating overpotentials required for CO2 reduction to HCOOH, CO, and HER, we find that Pd/G, Pt/G/Ag, and Pt/G/Au exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward HCOOH production. Our novel 2D hybrid catalyst design methodology may offer insights into enhanced electrochemical reactions through the electronic mixing of metal and other p&#8208;block elements.

         <title>Substantial Impact of Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Electrode Potential on the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Ru&#8722;CoP Urchin Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) resulted in a strong asymmetrical charge distribution on the Ru cluster, which accelerated water dissociation. However, strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low potentials. As the potential became more negative, the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had a near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus accelerating the entire alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process.







Abstract
Although great efforts on the delicate construction of a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) to modify the electronic properties of active sites have been conducted, the substantial impact of BIEF coupled with electrode potential on the electrochemical reactions has not been clearly investigated. Herein, we designed an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst composed of heterogeneous Ru&#8722;CoP urchin arrays on carbon cloth (Ru&#8722;CoP/CC) with a strong BIEF with the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Impressively, despite its unsatisfactory activity at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (overpotential of 44&#8197;mV), Ru&#8722;CoP/CC exhibited better activity (357&#8197;mV) than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (505&#8197;mV) at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low current densities. However, as the electrode potential became more negative (i.e., the current density increased), the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus greatly accelerating the whole alkaline HER process. This explains why the activity of Ru&#8722;CoP is relatively susceptible to the electrode potential compared to Pt/C.

         <title>Orthogonal Postsynthetic Copolymerization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks into a PolyHOF Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>

PolyHOF membrane, constructed via covalently copolymerizing nanoscale HOFs into polymeric network, not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties, but also shows excellent functional compatibility, proven by the benchmark luminescent temperature sensing behavior of lanthanide anchored polyHOF membrane even under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown promise in various fields; however, the construction of HOF/polymer hybrid membranes that can maintain both structural and functional integrity remains challenging. In this study, we here fabricated a new HOF (HOF&#8208;50) with reserved polymerizable allyl group via charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds between the carboxylate anion and amidinium, and subsequently copolymerized the HOF with monomers to construct a covalently bonded HOF/polymer hybrid (polyHOF) membrane. The resulting polyHOF membrane not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties and extreme stability, but also shows an exceptional ratiometric luminescent temperature&#8208;sensing function with very high sensitivity and visibility even when the lanthanide content is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported mixed&#8208;lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and lanthanide&#8208;doped covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This orthogonal postsynthesis copolymerization strategy may provide a general approach for preparing covalently connected HOF/polymer hybrid membranes for diverse applications.

Solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes are applied in metal&#8208;air batteries, introducing dual&#8208;air batteries for intrinsic safe energy storage. In their Research Article (e202318369), Xiaodong Chen and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that fire&#8208;tolerant batteries are achieved, and reveal that the highest tolerance temperature of electrolytes is determined by solute intramolecular bonds instead of solvent intermolecular interactions, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes for their thermal stability.

         <dc:description>
In the sunlight (oil phase), the Morning Stars (the Ag29 nanoclusters) shine brightly, but when night falls (aqueous phase transfer), the stars may lose their luster (photoluminescence quenching). Yet, there are always some special stars. When they come together (supramolecular recoupling), they become the shining Big Dipper (emission recovery) for guiding the direction (downstream hydrophilic applications). Details of the research are reported by Xi Kang, Wenxiong Shi, Manzhou Zhu et&#8197;al. (e202317995).

         <title>Empowering Site&#8208;Specific Bioconjugations In Vitro and In Vivo: Advances in Sortase Engineering and Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>

Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is extensively employed in site&#8208;specific bioconjugations. This review presents an overview of recent advancements in sortase engineering and the resulting innovative in vitro and in vivo SML applications. Moreover, we explore the potential future impact of integrating SML with cutting&#8208;edge techniques, such as click chemistry, unnatural amino acid incorporation, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, for interdisciplinary research.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) has emerged as a powerful and versatile methodology for site&#8208;specific protein conjugation, functionalization/labeling, immobilization, and design of biohybrid molecules and systems. However, the broader application of SML faces several challenges, such as limited activity and stability, dependence on calcium ions, and reversible reactions caused by nucleophilic side&#8208;products. Over the past decade, protein engineering campaigns and particularly directed evolution, have been extensively employed to overcome sortase limitations, thereby expanding the potential application of SML in multiple directions, including therapeutics, biorthogonal chemistry, biomaterials, and biosensors. This review provides an overview of achieved advancements in sortase engineering and highlights recent progress in utilizing SML in combination with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical and biological methodologies. The aim is to encourage scientists to employ sortases in their conjugation experiments.

Phosphine&#8208;functionalized MOFs (P&#8208;MOFs) offer novel opportunities in heterogeneous catalysis. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the reported P&#8208;MOFs. In particular, we remark the current obstacles and possible solutions, including new reaction types and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities behind challenges.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (P&#8208;MOFs) as an emerging class of coordination polymers, have provided novel opportunities for the development of heterogeneous catalysts. Yet, compared with the ubiquitous phosphine systems in homogeneous catalysis, heterogenization of phosphines in MOFs is still at its early stage. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the P&#8208;MOFs reported in literature. In particular, various catalytic reactions are discussed in detail in terms of phosphine ligand structure&#8208;function relationship, including the potential obstacles for future development. Finally, we discuss the possible solutions, including new types of reactions and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities and challenges.

         <title>Degradable Block Copolymer Nanoparticles Synthesized by Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes developments in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles, synthesized by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The high production efficiency of PISA coupled with degradability provides the next generation of particulate materials that can better serve the need for sustainability.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) combines polymerization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers in one system and has become a widely used method to prepare block copolymer nanoparticles at high concentrations. The persistence of polymers in the environment poses a huge threat to the ecosystem and represents a significant waste of resources. There is an urgent need to develop novel chemical approaches to synthesize degradable polymers. To meet with this demand, it is crucial to install degradability into PISA nanoparticles. Most recently, degradable PISA nanoparticles have been synthesized by introducing degradation mechanisms into either shell&#8208;forming or core&#8208;forming blocks. This Minireview summarizes the development in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles synthesized by PISA, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable, and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles. Future development will benefit from expansion of polymerization techniques with new degradation mechanisms and adaptation of high&#8208;throughput approaches for both PISA syntheses and degradation studies.

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Understanding London Dispersion Interactions in Molecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has by now been realized that London dispersion (LD) interactions, the main contributor to the attractive part of the van der Waals potential, are ubiquitously present and need to be taken into consideration in structures and dynamics of chemical reactions. This review highlights recent experimental and theoretical advances in utilizing LD interactions as a design element.







Abstract
London dispersion (LD) interactions are the main contribution of the attractive part of the van der Waals potential. Even though LD effects are the driving force for molecular aggregation and recognition, the role of these omnipresent interactions in structure and reactivity had been largely underappreciated over decades. However, in the recent years considerable efforts have been made to thoroughly study LD interactions and their potential as a chemical design element for structures and catalysis. This was made possible through a fruitful interplay of theory and experiment. This review highlights recent results and advances in utilizing LD interactions as a structural motif to understand and utilize intra&#8208; and intermolecularly LD&#8208;stabilized systems. Additionally, we focus on the quantification of LD interactions and their fundamental role in chemical reactions.

         <title>Designing and Engineering Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for CO2 to CO Conversion: From Single to Dual Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts are discussed from single to dual metal sites for CO2 to CO conversion. In particular, designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to break the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Challenges and solutions of CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors are highlighted for improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to achieving sustainable electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion and storage while decarbonizing the emission&#8208;heavy industry. The carbon&#8208;supported, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated, and atomically dispersed metal sites are effective catalysts for CO generation due to their high activity, selectivity, and earth abundance. Here, we discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts from single to dual metal sites. Engineering single metal sites using a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon model was highlighted to exclusively study the effect of carbon particle sizes, metal contents, and M&#8722;N bond structures in the form of MN4 moieties on catalytic activity and selectivity. The structure&#8208;property correlation was analyzed by combining experimental results with theoretical calculations to uncover the CO2 to CO conversion mechanisms. Furthermore, dual&#8208;metal site catalysts, inheriting the merits of single&#8208;metal sites, have emerged as a new frontier due to their potentially enhanced catalytic properties. Designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to alter the surface adsorption to CO2 and various intermediates, thus breaking the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors was discussed to provide insights into the electrolyzer design with improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.

         <title>A Straightforward Method for the Generation of Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen with a Partially Negative Line</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conditions under which orthohydrogen with a unique Partial Negative Line (PNL) can be observed were determined by one of the essential Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) hyperpolarization methods, called Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). A transient species exists during the preliminary SABRE activation processes, and is responsible for the generation of PNL.







Abstract
The hydrogen molecule, which exists in two spin isomers (ortho&#8208; and parahydrogen), is a highly studied system due to its fundamental properties and practical applications. Parahydrogen is used for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance signal enhancement, which is hyperpolarization of other molecules, including biorelevant ones. Hyperpolarization can be achieved by using Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). SABRE can also convert parahydrogen into orthohydrogen, and surprisingly, in some cases, it has been discovered that orthohydrogen's resonance has the Partially Negative Line (PNL) pattern. Here, an approach for obtaining orthohydrogen with a PNL signal is presented for two catalysts: Ir&#8722;IMes, and Ir&#8722;IMesBn. The type of solvent in which SABRE is conducted is crucial for the observation of PNL. Specifically, a PNL signal can be easily generated in benzene using both catalysts, but it is more intense for Ir&#8722;IMesBn. In acetone, PNL is observed only for Ir&#8722;IMesBn. In methanol, no PNL is detected. The PNL effect is only detectable during the initial steps of pre&#8208;catalyst activation, and disappears as the activation process progresses. We have proposed a working hypothesis that explains our results. The presented data may facilitate the further investigation of PNL and its applications in material science and catalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of redox active ester and oxime esters was realized through electrochemical cathodic reduction. Mechanistic studies unveil a high&#8208;valent nickel species&#8208;driven reductive elimination pathway, rather than direct radical&#8208;radical coupling. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through a broad scope (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176; carboxylic acids) and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.







Abstract
A new electrochemical transformation is presented that enables chemists to couple simple alkyl carboxylic acid derivatives with an electrophilic amine reagent to construct C(sp3)&#8722;N bond. The success of this reaction hinges on the merging of cooperative electrochemical reduction with nickel catalysis. The chemistry exhibits a high degree of practicality, showcasing its wide applicability with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176; carboxylic acids and remarkable compatibility with diverse functional groups, even in the realm of late&#8208;stage functionalization. Furthermore, extensive mechanistic studies have unveiled the engagement of alkyl radicals and iminyl radicals; and elucidated the multifaceted roles played by iPr2O, Ni catalyst, and electricity.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Complex Polyenes through Sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of trans&#8208;Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes is presented. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization via a six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;palladacycle to afford tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization via a seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;palladacycle to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide.







Abstract
Sequential C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules containing multiple C&#8722;H bonds can efficiently lead to structural diversity. Herein we present the first chelation&#8208;assisted sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E&#8208;styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization by six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;cyclopalladation to result in tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization through seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;cyclopalladation to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes in up to 97&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99/1 E/Z selectivity, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide. The protocol is demonstrated to be widely applicable, tolerant to a wide range of functional groups and bioactive fragments, and suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as one&#8208;pot and two step preparation of trienes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the selectivity and reactivity.

         <title>Dynamic Monkey Bar Mechanism of Superionic Li&#8208;ion Transport in LiTaCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning force field molecular dynamics simulations reveal the superionic Li+ transport in glassy LiTaCl6 via the dynamic monkey bar mechanism&#8211;the high density and dynamics of the vibrating Cl&#8722; ions (the dynamic bars) allow Li ions to hold on to them while moving fast through the lattice.







Abstract
The LiTaCl6 solid electrolyte has the lowest activation energy of ionic conduction at ambient conditions (0.165&#8197;eV), with a record high ionic conductivity for a ternary compound (11&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). However, the mechanism has been unclear. We train machine&#8208;learning force fields (MLFF) on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data on&#8208;the&#8208;fly and perform MLFF MD simulations of AIMD quality up to the nanosecond scale at the experimental temperatures, which allows us to predict accurate activation energy for Li&#8208;ion diffusion (at 0.164&#8197;eV). Detailed analyses of trajectories and vibrational density of states show that the large&#8208;amplitude vibrations of Cl&#8722; ions in TaCl6&#8722; enable the fast Li&#8208;ion transport by allowing dynamic breaking and reforming of Li&#8722;Cl bonds across the space in between the TaCl6&#8722; octahedra. We term this process the dynamic&#8208;monkey&#8208;bar mechanism of superionic Li+ transport which could aid the development of new solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

A cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reaction Scheme is demonstrated to convert CO2 to propionaldehyde. By individually optimizing and efficiently coupling the upstream and downstream processes, this hybrid system achieves a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38&#8201;%, considerably higher than the best electrochemical systems alone or other hybrid systems reported earlier.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction can convert CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, but its selectivity toward C3+ products are very limited. One possible solution is to run the reactions in hybrid processes by coupling electrocatalysis with other catalytic routes. In this contribution, we report the cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 to propionaldehyde. Using Cu(OH)2 nanowires as the precatalyst, CO2/H2O is reduced to concentrated C2H4, CO, and H2 gases in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactor. The thermochemical hydroformylation reaction is separately investigated with a series of rhodium&#8208;phosphine complexes. The best candidate is identified to be the one with the 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane diphosphine ligand, which exhibits a propionaldehyde turnover number of 1148 under a mild temperature and close&#8208;to&#8208;atmospheric pressure. By coupling and optimizing the upstream CO2 electroreduction and downstream hydroformylation reaction, we achieve a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38&#8201;% and a total C3 oxygenate selectivity of 44&#8201;% based on reduced CO2. These values represent a more than seven times improvement over the best prior electrochemical system alone or over two times improvement over other hybrid systems.

         <title>Supramolecular Complexation of Metal Oxide Cluster and Non&#8208;Fluorinated Polymer for Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Proton Exchange Membranes for High&#8208;Power&#8208;Density Fuel Cells</title>

The facile and cost&#8208;effective hybridization strategy for proton exchange membranes (PEMs) design by blending 1&#8197;nm metal oxide clusters and polyvinyl butyral. The fuel cells equipped with the PEM show promising power densities and excellent durability that is on par with Nafion&#174; and surpass the previously reported non&#8208;fluorinated PEMs.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective, non&#8208;fluorinated polymer proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are highly desirable in emerging hydrogen fuel cells (FCs) technology; however, their low proton conductivities and poor chemical and dimension stabilities hinder their further development as alternatives to commercial Nafion&#174;. Here, we report the inorganic&#8208;organic hybridization strategy by facilely complexing commercial polymers, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), with inorganic molecular nanoparticles, H3PW12O40 (PW) via supramolecular interaction. The strong affinity among them endows the obtained nanocomposites amphiphilicity and further lead to phase separation for bi&#8208;continuous structures with both inter&#8208;connected proton transportation channels and robust polymer scaffold, enabling high proton conductivities, mechanical/dimension stability and barrier performance, and the H2/O2 FCs equipped with the composite PEM show promising power densities and long&#8208;term stability. Interestingly, the hybrid PEM can be fabricated continuously in large scale at challenging ~10&#8197;&#956;m thickness via typical tape casting technique originated from their facile complexing strategy and the hybrids&#8217; excellent mechanical properties. This work not only provides potential material systems for commercial PEMs, but also raises interest for the research on hybrid composites for PEMs.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;fused Nitrogen Heterocycles by Asymmetric Ring Expansion and Stereochemically Retentive Re&#8208;contraction of Cyclic Ureas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric deprotonation of N&#8208;benzyl urea derivatives of nitrogen heterocycles leads to enantioselective insertion of the benzylic substituent into an aromatic C&#8722;N bond. Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded products induces a stereospecific ring&#8208;contraction that results in an overall asymmetric enantioselective one&#8208;carbon enlargement of the heterocycle.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused nitrogen heterocycles are common features of bioactive molecules, and the enantioselective synthesis of their substituted analogues is an important goal. In this paper we demonstrate a practical and mechanistically intriguing approach to the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;arylbenzazepines and their analogues. The reaction sequence starts with an asymmetric migratory ring expansion of indoline, tetrahydroquinoline, or tetrahydrobenzazepine ureas on treatment with a chiral lithium amide base. Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded ureas with acid triggers a two&#8208;atom ring contraction&#8212;an &#8216;azatropic shift&#8217; in which one urea nitrogen displaces the other&#8212;with almost complete retention of stereochemistry. Aminolysis of the urea products provides enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydrobenzazepine derivatives and their congeners, including an analogue of an intermediate in the synthesis of the drug solifenacin. Deuteration, in situ IR, and DFT studies provide evidence for the mechanisms of the reaction steps.

         <title>Converting Glycerol into Valuable Trioses by Cu&#948;+&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated WO3 under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;decorated WO3 photocatalyst has achieved a high conversion rate and excellent selectivity in the process of visible light&#8208;driven oxidation of glycerol to trioses. The critical role of single Cu atoms is to attract photogenerated holes, thereby improving charge transfer and activating glycerol molecules.







Abstract
Photocatalytic selective oxidation under visible light presents a promising approach for the sustainable transformation of biomass&#8208;derived wastes. However, achieving both high conversion and excellent selectivity poses a significant challenge. In this study, two valuable trioses, glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, are produced from glycerol over Cu&#948;+&#8208;decorated WO3 photocatalyst in the presence of H2O2. The photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable five&#8208;fold increase in the conversion rate (3.81&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) while maintaining a high selectivity towards two trioses (46.4&#8201;% to glyceraldehyde and 32.9&#8201;% to dihydroxyacetone). Through a comprehensive analysis involving X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements with and without light irradiation, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and isotopic analysis, the critical role of Cu+ species has been explored as efficient hole acceptors. These species facilitate charge transfer, promoting glycerol oxidation by photoholes, followed by coupling with OH&#8208;, which are subsequently dehydrated to yield the desired glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone.

Making anionic zirconium&#8208;organic cage and cationic boron&#8208;imidazolate cage into a tightly ordered structure achieves an efficient optical limiting response.







Abstract
Making oppositely charged metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) into a tightly ordered structure may bring interesting functions. Herein, we report a novel structure composed of anionic (Zr4L6)8&#8722; (L=embonate) tetrahedral cages and in situ&#8208;formed cationic [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ (Bim=[BH(im)3]&#8722;; im=imidazole) cubic cages. Chiral transfer is observed from enantiopure (Zr4L6)8&#8722; cage to enantiopure [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ cage. A pair of enantiomers (PTC&#8208;373(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;373(&#923;)) are formed. PTC&#8208;373 exhibits high chemical and thermal stabilities, affording an interesting single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. More importantly, the combination of ionic pair cages significantly enhances its third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property, and its thin&#8208;film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.

Herein, we report a novel structure composed of anionic (Zr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;8&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (L=embonate) tetrahedral cages and in situ-formed cationic [Zn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Bim)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (Bim=[BH(im)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; im=imidazole) cubic cages. Chiral transfer is observed from enantiopure (Zr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;8&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; cage to enantiopure [Zn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Bim)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cage. A pair of enantiomers (PTC-373(&#916;) and PTC-373(&#923;)) are formed. PTC-373 exhibits high chemical and thermal stabilities, affording an interesting single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. More importantly, the combination of ionic pair cages significantly enhances its third-order nonlinear optical property, and its thin-film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalysis: Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde Oxidation without Sacrifical Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that a two&#8208;hole oxidation process such as TEMPO catalyzed alcohol oxidation is a viable reaction to couple with reduction reaction to eliminate SED and generate two added&#8208;value chemicals in dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
There is a growing interest in developing dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) to produce molecular hydrogen (H2) as alternative energy source. To improve the sustainability of this technology, we replaced the sacrificial electron donor (SED), typically an expensive and polluting chemical, with an alcohol oxidation catalyst. This study demonstrates the first
dye&#8208;sensitized system using a diketopyrrolopyrrole dye covalently linked to 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) based catalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde transformation operating in water with visible irradiation.

         <title>Reversible Thiyl Radical Addition&#8722;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy has been developed, which could directly control the thiyl radical chain polymerizations to afford polymers with a controlled molecular weight and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Developing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods that could directly control the thiyl radical propagation is highly desirable yet remains challenging in modern polymer chemistry. Here, we reported the first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy, which utilizes allyl sulfides as chain transfer agents for reversibly deactivating the propagating thiyl radicals, thus allowing us to directly control a challenging thiyl radical chain polymerization to afford polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures. A linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, high chain&#8208;end fidelity, and efficient chain extension proved good controllability of the polymerization. In addition, density functional theory calculations provided insight into the reversible deactivation ability of allyl sulfides. The SRAFT strategy developed in this work represents a promising platform for discovering new controlled polymerizations based on thiyl radical chemistry.

Amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes enable the electrophilic amination of arylboronic acids and boronates. Iodine(III) reagents with transferable amino groups, including one with an NH2 group, were synthesized and used in the amination, allowing the synthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary (hetero)arylamines.







Abstract
In this report, we describe the use of amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes in the electrophilic amination of arylboronic acids and boronates. Iodine(III) reagents with transferable amino groups, including one with an NH2 group, were synthesized and used in the amination, allowing the synthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary (hetero)arylamines. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations indicate that the reaction proceeds through an electrophilic amination process from a tetravalent borate complex with a B&#8722;N dative bond.

         <title>Peptide and Enzyme Catalysts Work in Concert in Stereoselective Cascade Reactions&#8212;Oxidation followed by Conjugate Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme and a peptide catalyze&#8212;in an aqueous buffer&#8212;a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity in one pot. The optimization of the modular peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions were key for bringing the two worlds of enzyme and peptide catalysis together.







Abstract
Enzymes and peptide catalysts consist of the same building blocks but require vastly different environments to operate best. Herein, we show that an enzyme and a peptide catalyst can work together in a single reaction vessel to catalyze a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Abundant linear alcohols, nitroolefins, an alcohol oxidase, and a tripeptide catalyst provided chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes in aqueous buffer. High yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and stereoselectivities (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were achieved for the cascade through the rational design of the peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Ru Nanoparticles with Parasitic Ru&#8208;Co Dual&#8208;Single Atoms Overcome the Volmer Step of Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry of ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles is compromised by embedding Co single atoms, leading to the release of Ru single atoms and the formation of a Co1Ru1,n/rGO structure, which regulates the interaction between active sites and enhances the hydrogen oxidation reaction kinetics, mass activity and excellent durability.







Abstract
Efficient dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for enhancing atomic efficiency and promoting the commercialization of fuel cells, but addressing the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media and the facile dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom site generation remains formidable challenges. Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra&#8208;small ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles by embedding cobalt (Co) single atoms, which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co1Ru1,n/rGO). In situ operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen&#8208;affine Co atom disrupts the symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles, resulting in parasitic Ru and Co dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom within Ru nanoparticles. The interaction between Ru single atoms and nanoparticles forms effective active centers. The parasitism of Co atoms modulates the adsorption of OH intermediates on Ru active sites, accelerating HOR kinetics through faster formation of *H2O. As anticipated, Co1Ru1,n/rGO exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (7.68&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1) at 50&#8197;mV and exchange current density (0.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), which are 6 and 7 times higher than those of Ru/rGO, respectively. Notably, it also displays exceptional durability surpassing that of commercial Pt catalysts. This investigation provides valuable insights into hybrid multi&#8208;single&#8208;atom and metal nanoparticle catalysis.

The interaction between Ru single atoms and nanoparticles forms effective active centers. The parasitism of Co atoms modulates the adsorption of OH intermediates on Ru active sites, accelerating HOR kinetics through faster formation of *H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. As anticipated, Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;1,n&lt;/sub&gt;/rGO exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (7.68&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 50&#8197;mV and exchange current density (0.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which are 6 and 7 times higher than those of Ru/rGO, respectively. Notably, it also displays exceptional durability surpassing that of commercial Pt catalysts. This investigation provides valuable insights into hybrid multi-single-atom and metal nanoparticle catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Arylketone Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of arylketone oxime ethers has been realized. Regioselective deuteration of some biologically important drugs and natural products is showcased via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation and subsequent deacylative deuteration. Vicinal difunctionalization of electro&#8208;rich arenes is achieved by using the ketone as both directing group and leaving group.







Abstract
We report herein the development of palladium&#8208;catalyzed deacylative deuteration of arylketone oxime ethers. This protocol features excellent functional group tolerance, heterocyclic compatibility, and high deuterium incorporation levels. Regioselective deuteration of some biologically important drugs and natural products are showcased via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation and subsequent deacylative deuteration. Vicinal meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization (including fluorination, arylation, and alkylation) and para&#8208;C&#8722;H bond deuteration of electro&#8208;rich arenes are realized by using the ketone as both directing group and leaving group, which is distinct from aryl halide in conventional dehalogenative deuteration.

         <title>sp3&#8208;Rich Heterocycle Synthesis on DNA: Application to DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp3)&#8208;rich mono&#8208; and bicyclic heterocycles can be assembled on DNA from readily available ketochlorohydrins through a reductive amination and cyclization process. The resulting hydroxypyrrolidine&#8208;containing DNA encoded libraries occupy a unique region of pharmaceutically relevant chemical space.







Abstract
DNA encoded library (DEL) synthesis represents a convenient means to produce, annotate and store large collections of compounds in a small volume. While DELs are well suited for drug discovery campaigns, the chemistry used in their production must be compatible with the DNA tag, which can limit compound class accessibility. As a result, most DELs are heavily populated with peptidomimetic and sp2&#8208;rich molecules. Herein, we show that sp3&#8208;rich mono&#8208; and bicyclic heterocycles can be made on DNA from ketochlorohydrin aldol products through a reductive amination and cyclization process. The resulting hydroxypyrrolidines possess structural features that are desirable for DELs and target a distinct region of pharmaceutically relevant chemical space.

         <title>Mining the Metabolic Capacity of Clostridium sporogenes Aided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metabolic capacity of Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 15579 against small molecules was predicted by using an in silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, followed by experimental evaluation in vivo. Bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays were further utilized to identify an enzyme EvoB3 for everolimus modification through ketoreduction.







Abstract
Anaerobes dominate the microbiota of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where a significant portion of small molecules can be degraded or modified. However, the enormous metabolic capacity of gut anaerobes remains largely elusive in contrast to aerobic bacteria, mainly due to the requirement of sophisticated laboratory settings. In this study, we employed an in silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, to predict the metabolic capacity of a gut anaerobe, Clostridium sporogenes, against small molecules. Experiments revealed that among the top seven candidates predicted as unstable, six indeed exhibited instability in C. sporogenes culture. We further identified several metabolites resulting from the supplementation of everolimus in the bacterial culture for the first time. By utilizing bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays, we successfully identified an enzyme encoded in the genome of C. sporogenes responsible for everolimus transformation. Our framework thus can potentially facilitate future understanding of small molecules metabolism in the gut, further improve patient care through personalized medicine, and guide the development of new small molecule drugs and therapeutic approaches.

         <dc:description>
A chiral cyclopentadienyl&#8208;rhodium(III) catalyzed highly enantioselective aziridination of challenging unactivated terminal alkenes and N&#8208;pivalolyloxy sulfonamides has been developed. This catalytic system demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity and broad functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yields, 93% ee).







Abstract
Chiral cyclopentadienyl&#8208;rhodium(III) CpxRh(III) catalysis has been demonstrated to be competent for catalyzing highly enantioselective aziridination of challenging unactivated terminal alkenes and nitrene sources. The chiral CpxRh(III) catalysis system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance and wide functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 93&#8201;% ee). This protocol presents a novel and effective strategy for synthesizing enantioenriched aziridines from simple alkenes. Various transformations were performed on the aziridine products, illustrating the versatility and synthetic potential of this protocol for constructing highly functionalized compounds.

         <title>Fundamental structural and electronic understanding of palladium catalysts on nitride and oxide supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nature of the support can fundamentally affect the function of a heterogeneous catalyst. For the novel type of isolated metal atom catalysts, sometimes referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts, systematic correlations are still rare. Here, we report a general finding that Pd on nitride supports (non&#8208;metal and metal nitride) always features a higher oxidation state compared to that on oxide supports (non&#8208;metal and metal oxide). Through thorough oxidation state investigations by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO&#8208;DRIFTS, and density functional theory (DFT) coupled with Bader charge analysis, it is found that Pd atoms prefer to interact with surface hydroxyl group to form a Pd(OH)x species on oxide supports, while on nitride supports, Pd atoms incorporate into the surface structure in the form of Pd&#8722;N bonds. Moreover, a correlation was built between the formal oxidation state and the computational Bader charge, based on the periodic trend in electronegativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Transesterification Induced Multifunctional Additives Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrolyte chemistry is crucially important for promoting the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H2O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li+. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic&#8208;rich layer (e.g. Li3N/Li3P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high&#8208;performance electrolyte for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a pragmatic choice for high&#8208;safety sodium batteries but still plagued by interfacial compatibility with both cathode and anode simultaneously. Here, salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer fibers with NaF salt inlaid in polylactide (PLA) fiber network was fabricated via electrospinning and subsequent in&#8208;situ forming gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte in liquid electrolytes. The obtained PLA&#8208;NaF GPE achieves a high ion conductivity (2.50 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and large Na+ transference number (0.75) at ambient temperature. Notably, the dissolution of NaF salt occupies solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment, which facilitates aggregates with increased anionic coordination (anion/Na+&gt;1). Aggregates with higher HOMO realizes the preferential oxidation on the cathode so that inorganic&#8208;rich and stable CEI covers cathode&#8217; surface, preventing particles&#8217; breakage and showing good compatibility with different cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)3, Na2+2xFe2&#8208;x(SO4)3, Na0.72Ni0.32Mn0.68O2, NaTi2(PO4)3). While, passivated Na anode induced by the lower LUMO of aggregates, and the lower surface tension between Na anode and PLA&#8208;NaF GPE interface, leading to the dendrites&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the assembled Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclopropenimine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Activation for the Synthesis of Polyurethanes and Small&#8208;Molecule Carbonates and Carbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Given the adverse impact of CO2 on the atmosphere, it is of paramount importance to devise strategies for upcycling it into useful materials, such as polymers and fine chemicals. To activate such stable molecule, superbases offer viable modes of binding to CO2. In this study, a superbase cyclopropenimine derivative was found to exhibit exceptional proficiency in activating CO2 and mediating its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. The versatility of this reaction can be extended to monofunctional amines and alcohols, yielding a variety of functional carbonates and carbamates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Thioesterase Involved in Dimerizationduring Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cinnamoyl lipid compound youssoufene A1 (1), featuring a unique dearomatic carbon&#8208;bridged dimeric skeleton, exhibits increased inhibition against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis compared to monomeric youssoufenes. However, the formation process of this intriguing dearomatic dimerization remains unknown. In this work, an unusual&#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221;thioesterase (TE) gene ysfF was functionally characterized. The gene was found to naturally encodes two proteins, an entire YsfF with&#160;&#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase&#160;and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase (4&#8208;HBT)&#8208;like enzyme&#160;domains, and a nested YsfFHBT (4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme). Using intracellular tagged carrier&#8208;protein tracking (ITCT) strategy, in vitro reconstitution and in vivo experiments, we found that: i) both domains of YsfF displayed thioesterase activities; ii) YsfF/YsfFHBT could accomplish the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure for benzene ring formation; and iii)&#160;YsfF and cyclase YsfX together were responsible&#160;for the ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatic dimerization process, possibly via an unprecedent Michael&#8208;type addition reaction. Moreover, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that N301, E483 and H566 of YsfF are critical residues for both the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and dimerization processes. This study&#160;enhances our understanding of&#160;the multifunctionality of the TE protein family.</dc:description>

This study&#160;enhances our understanding of&#160;the multifunctionality of the TE protein family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Curvature Induction in an Artificial Bilayer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maintaining lipid asymmetry across membrane leaflets is critical for functions like vesicular traffic and organelle homeostasis. However, a lack of molecular&#8208;level understanding of the mechanisms underlying membrane fission and fusion processes in synthetic systems precludes their development as artificial analogs. Here, we report asymmetry induction of a bilayer membrane formed by an extended p&#8208;conjugated molecule with oxyalkylene side chains bearing terminal tertiary amine moieties (BA1) in water. Autogenous protonation of the tertiary amines in the periphery of the bilayer by water induces anisotropic curvature, resulting in membrane fission to form vesicles and can be monitored using time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy and microscopy. Interestingly, upon loss of the induced asymmetry by extensive protonation using an organic acid restored bilayer membrane. The mechanism leading to the compositional asymmetry in the leaflet and curvature induction in membrane is validated by DFT calculations. Studies extended to control molecules having changes in hydrophilic (BA2) and hydrophobic (BA3) segments provide insight into the delicate nature of molecular scale interactions in the dynamic transformation of supramolecular structures. The synergic effect of hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of BA1 aggregates provide dynamicity and unusual stability. Our study unveils mechanistic insight into the dynamic transformation of bilayer membranes into vesicles.</dc:description>

By strategically cleaving C&#8208;C bonds and editing the molecular structure, more efficient and versatile pathways for the synthesis of complex compounds could be designed, which brings significant implications for drug development and materials science. o&#8208;Aminophenethyl alcohols and amines are the essential key motifs in bioactive and functional material molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Asymmetric Backbone for Highly Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.7% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), PEDOT:PSS, is the most widely used material in the realization of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the stability of PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based OSCs is quite poor, arising from its strong acidity and hygroscopicity. In addition, PEDOT:PSS has an absorption in the infrared region region and high HOMO energy level, thus limiting the enhancement of short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), respectively. Herein, two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs), namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTMs in binary OSCs based on the well&#8208;known system of PM6:Y6, PM6:eC9, PM6:L8&#8208;BO, and D18:eC9. Compared with BrCz, BrBACz shows larger dipole moment, deeper work function and lower surface energy. Moreover, BrBACz not only enhances photon harvesting in the active layer, but also minimizes voltage losses, thus improving interface charge extraction/ transport. Consequently, the PM6:eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz as HTM exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.70 % with a remarkable JSC of 29.20 mA cm&#8208;2 and a VOC of 0.856 V, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs so far. In addition, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0 % of its original efficiency after 1,000 hours of storage at ambient condition, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Appending Coronene Diimide with Carbon Nanohoops Allows for Rapid Intersystem Crossing in Neat Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative triplet materials plays a significant role in various applications. Although effective tuning of triplet formation by intersystem crossing (ISC) has been well established in solution, the modulation of ISC processes in the solid state remains a challenge due to the presence of other exciton decay channels through intermolecular interactions. The cyclic structure of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) offers a unique platform to tune the intermolecular packing, which leads to controllable exciton dynamics in the solid state. Herein, by integrating an electron deficient coronene diimide (CDI) unit into the CPP framework, a donor&#8722;acceptor type of conjugated macrocycle (CDI&#8722;CPP) featuring intramolecular charge&#8722;transfer (CT) interaction was designed and synthesized. Effective intermolecular CT interaction resulting from a slipped herringbone packing was confirmed by X&#8722;ray crystallography. Transient spectroscopy studies showed that CDI&#8722;CPP undergoes ISC in both solution and the film state, with triplet generation time constants of 4.5 ns and 238 ps, respectively. The rapid triplet formation through ISC in the film state can be ascribed to the cooperation between intra&#8722; and intermolecular charge&#8722;transfer interactions. Our results highlight that intermolecular CT interaction has a pronounced effect on the ISC process in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Genes For Dynamic Regulation Of DNA&#8208;Based Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a strategy to control dynamically the loading and release of molecular ligands from synthetic nucleic acid receptors using in vitro transcription. We demonstrate this by engineering three model synthetic DNA&#8208;based receptors: a triplex&#8208;forming DNA complex, an ATP&#8208;binding aptamer, and a hairpin strand, whose ability to bind their specific ligands can be cotranscriptionally regulated (activated or inhibited) through specific RNA molecules produced by rationally designed synthetic genes. The kinetics of our DNA sensors and their genetically generated inputs can be captured using differential equation models, corroborating the predictability of the approach used. This approach shows that highly programmable nucleic acid receptors can be controlled with molecular instructions provided by dynamic transcriptional systems, illustrating their promise in the context of coupling DNA nanotechnology with biological signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Supramolecular Polymers for Recyclable Photobiocatalytic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying enzymes with supramolecular polymers created SupEnzyme, endowing them with supramolecular functions and responsiveness to guest polymers. This approach significantly enhances enzyme recycling and offers advantages for photobiocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Chemical modifications of enzymes excel in the realm of enzyme engineering due to its directness, robustness, and efficiency; however, challenges persist in devising versatile and effective strategies. In this study, we introduce a supramolecular modification methodology that amalgamates a supramolecular polymer with Candida antarctica lipase&#8197;B (CalB) to create supramolecular enzymes (SupEnzyme). This approach features the straightforward preparation of a supramolecular amphiphilic polymer (&#946;&#8208;CD@SMA), which was subsequently conjugated to the enzyme, resulting in a SupEnzyme capable of self&#8208;assembly into supramolecular nanoparticles. The resulting SupEnzyme nanoparticles can form micron&#8208;scale supramolecular aggregates through supramolecular and electrostatic interactions with guest entities, thus enhancing catalyst recycling. Remarkably, these aggregates maintain 80&#8201;% activity after seven cycles, outperforming Novozym 435. Additionally, they can effectively initiate photobiocatalytic cascade reactions using guest photocatalysts. As a consequence, our SupEnzyme methodology exhibits noteworthy adaptability in enzyme modification, presenting a versatile platform for various polymer, enzyme, and biocompatible catalyst pairings, with potential applications in the fields of chemistry and biology.

         <title>Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Synthesis of Propargyl&#8208; and Allenylsilanes through Catalytic Propargylic C&#8722;H Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular propargylic C&#8722;H silylation mediated by an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir complex. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric, synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity.







Abstract
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H bond silylation catalyzed by a phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric and synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity. In the case of unsymmetrical dialkyl acetylenes, good to excellent selectivity for functionalization at the less&#8208;hindered site was also observed. A variety of electrophilic silyl sources (R3SiOTf and R3SiNTf2), either commercial or in situ&#8208;generated, were used as the silylation reagents, and a broad range of simple and functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkyl acetylenes, dialkyl acetylenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and drug derivatives were successfully employed as substrates. Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir intermediate is generated upon &#960;&#8208;complexation&#8208;assisted deprotonation and undergoes outer&#8208;sphere attack by the electrophilic silylating reagent to give propargylic silanes, with the latter step identified as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Electrokinetic Analyses Uncover the Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Biomass&#8208;Derived Monosaccharide Electroreduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical DHA conversion undergoes an initial dehydration and the subsequent hydrogenation to the acetol product. The electrokinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;determining step follows an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism, that is, increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone will promote the activity. At alkaline (local) pH, DHA conversion is a homogeneous chemical reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical biomass conversion holds promise to upcycle carbon sources and produce valuable products while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, deep insight into the interfacial mechanism is essential for the rational design of an efficient electrocatalytic route, which is still an area of active research and development. Herein, we report the reduction of dihydroxyacetone (DHA)&#8212;the simplest monosaccharide derived from glycerol feedstock&#8212;to acetol, the vital chemical intermediate in industries, with faradaic efficiency of 85&#177;5&#8201;% on a polycrystalline Cu electrode. DHA reduction follows preceding dehydration by coordination with the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups and the subsequent hydrogenation. The electrokinetic profile indicates that the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) includes a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the dehydrated intermediate, revealed by coverage&#8208;dependent Tafel slope and isotopic labeling experiments. An approximate zero&#8208;order dependence of H+ suggests that water acts as the proton donor for the interfacial PCET process. Leveraging these insights, we formulate microkinetic models to illustrate its origin that Eley&#8211;Rideal (E&#8722;R) dominates over Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) in governing Cu&#8208;mediated DHA reduction, offering rational guidance that increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone would be sufficient to promote the activity in designing practical catalysts.

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Disila&#8208;carbocycles via Highly Selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the intermolecular &#963;&#8208;bond exchange reaction of two different C&#8722;Si bonds with high cross&#8208;redistribution selectivity, which serves as a ring expansion protocol to assemble diverse disila&#8208;carbocycles. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the presence of hydrogen on silicon of silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain for both of two substrates are critical to ensure the desired reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully inhibited the preferential homodimerization and C&#8722;Si/Si&#8722;H bond cross&#8208;exchange of benzosilacyclobutenes and monohydro&#8208;silacyclobutanes and achieved the first highly selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction by deliberately tuning the Ni&#8208;catalytic system, which constitutes a powerful and atom&#8208;economical ring expansion method for preparing medium&#8208;sized cyclic compounds bearing two silicon atoms at the ring junction, which are otherwise inaccessible. The DFT calculation explicitly elucidated the pivotal role of Si&#8722;H bond at silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain of two substrates in realizing the two C&#8722;Si bonds cleavage and reformation in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Surface Lattice Modulation Enables Stable Cycling of High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries at High Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a surface&#8208;lattice&#8208;doping (SLD) strategy for the stabilization of the solid electrolyte/cathode interface for its working at a high voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. Specifically, a uniform AlPO4 coating layer was built with nanometer precision around the LiCoO2 (LCO) particle. The following sintering at high temperature induced a homogeneous Al3+ diffusion into the LCO crust, leading to a controlled degree of surface Al/Co/Li disorder together with the formed Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 islands decorating the LCO surface. We found that this SLD strategy is capable of not only suppressing the structural degradation of LCO itself, but also effectively mitigating the decomposition of the chloride&#8208;based solid electrolyte at the interface, thereby ensuring the assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a LiCoO2 cathode excellent cycling stability at 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good oxidative stability, face notable challenges in all&#8211;solid&#8211;state Li&#8211;ion batteries (ASSBs), especially with unstable cathode/solid electrolyte (SE) interface and increasing interfacial resistance during cycling. In this work, we have developed an Al3+&#8211;doped, cation&#8211;disordered epitaxial nanolayer on the LiCoO2 surface by reacting it with an artificially constructed AlPO4 nanoshell; this lithium&#8211;deficient layer featuring a rock&#8211;salt&#8211;like phase effectively suppresses oxidative decomposition of Li3InCl6 electrolyte and stabilizes the cathode/SE interface at 4.5&#8197;V. The ASSBs with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a high&#8211;loading LiCoO2 cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity and long cycling life from 3 to 4.5&#8197;V. Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8211;based ASSBs at high voltages.

         <title>Deciphering the Chemical Language of the Immunomodulatory Properties of Veillonella parvula Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gut microbes might tip the delicate balance towards tolerance or inflammation. By analyzing the chemistry of LPS from two strains of the pathobiont Veillonella parvula, key and unprecedented structural differences were uncovered, which were reflected in diverse immunoactivities. Attempts were made to identify the molecular determinants governing this phenomenon.







Abstract
Veillonella parvula, prototypical member of the oral and gut microbiota, is at times commensal yet also potentially pathogenic. The definition of the molecular basis tailoring this contrasting behavior is key for broadening our understanding of the microbiota&#8208;driven pathogenic and/or tolerogenic mechanisms that take place within our body. In this study, we focused on the chemistry of the main constituent of the outer membrane of V. parvula, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS molecules indeed elicit pro&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses depending on their chemical structures. Herein we report the structural elucidation of the LPS from two strains of V. parvula and show important and unprecedented differences in both the lipid and carbohydrate moieties, including the identification of a novel galactofuranose and mannitol&#8208;containing O&#8208;antigen repeating unit for one of the two strains. Furthermore, by harnessing computational studies, in vitro human cell models, as well as lectin binding solid&#8208;phase assays, we discovered that the two chemically diverse LPS immunologically behave differently and have attempted to identify the molecular determinant(s) governing this phenomenon.

&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gut microbes might tip the delicate balance towards tolerance or inflammation. By analyzing the chemistry of LPS from two strains of the pathobiont &lt;i&gt;Veillonella parvula&lt;/i&gt;, key and unprecedented structural differences were uncovered, which were reflected in diverse immunoactivities. Attempts were made to identify the molecular determinants governing this phenomenon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Veillonella parvula&lt;/i&gt;, prototypical member of the oral and gut microbiota, is at times commensal yet also potentially pathogenic. The definition of the molecular basis tailoring this contrasting behavior is key for broadening our understanding of the microbiota-driven pathogenic and/or tolerogenic mechanisms that take place within our body. In this study, we focused on the chemistry of the main constituent of the outer membrane of &lt;i&gt;V. parvula&lt;/i&gt;, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS molecules indeed elicit pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses depending on their chemical structures. Herein we report the structural elucidation of the LPS from two strains of &lt;i&gt;V. parvula&lt;/i&gt; and show important and unprecedented differences in both the lipid and carbohydrate moieties, including the identification of a novel galactofuranose and mannitol-containing O-antigen repeating unit for one of the two strains. Furthermore, by harnessing computational studies, in vitro human cell models, as well as lectin binding solid-phase assays, we discovered that the two chemically diverse LPS immunologically behave differently and have attempted to identify the molecular determinant(s) governing this phenomenon. Whereas pro-inflammatory potential has been evidenced for the lipid A moiety, by contrast a plausible &#8220;immune modulating&#8221; action has been proposed for the peculiar O-antigen portion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We report the triply selective and sequential diversification of a single Csp3 carbon carrying Cl, Bpin and GeEt3 for the modular and programmable construction of sp3&#8208;rich molecules. Various functionalizations of Csp3&#8722;Cl and Csp3&#8722;BPin (e.g. alkylation, arylation, homologation, amination, hydroxylation) were tolerated by the Csp3&#8722;GeEt3 group. Moreover, the methodological repertoire of alkyl germane functionalization was significantly expanded beyond the hitherto known Giese addition and arylation to alkynylation, alkenylation, cyanation, halogenation, azidation, C&#8722;S bond formation as well as the first demonstration of stereo&#8208;selective functionalization of a Csp3&#8208;[Ge] bond.

         <title>Phosphate Coordination to Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Secondary Building Units Prolongs Drug Retention for Synergistic Chemoradiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) to a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) prolongs its intratumoral retention and allows its continuous release for effective localized chemotherapy. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) significantly outperforms free GMP and provides synergistic, potent chemoradiotherapy without causing side effects.







Abstract
Chemoradiotherapy combines radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy to potentiate antitumor activity but exacerbates toxicities and causes debilitating side effects in cancer patients. Herein, we report the use of a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) as a 2D nanoradiosensitizer and a reservoir for the slow release of chemotherapeutics to amplify the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Coordination of phosphate&#8208;containing drugs to MOL secondary building units prolongs their intratumoral retention, allowing for continuous release of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) for effective localized chemotherapy. In the meantime, the MOL sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray irradiation and provides potent radiotherapeutic effects. GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) enhances cytotoxicity by 2&#8208;fold and improves radiotherapeutic effects over free GMP in vitro. In a colon cancer model, GMP/MOL retains GMP in tumors for more than four days and, when combined with low&#8208;dose radiotherapy, inhibits tumor growth by 98&#8201;%. The synergistic chemoradiotherapy enabled by GMP/MOL shows a cure rate of 50&#8201;%, improves survival, and ameliorates cancer&#8208;proliferation histological biomarkers.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening of 1H&#8208;Benzo[4,5]oxazolopyridinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective and stereoselective C&#8722;O activation was achieved for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;arylisoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones. This method set up a new synthetic strategy for C&#8722;N atropisomer synthesis via an enantioselective ring&#8208;opening dynamic kinetic resolution process.







Abstract
The development of new methods for regio&#8208; and stereoselective activation of C&#8722;O bonds in ethers holds significant promise for synthetic chemistry, offering advantages in terms of environmental sustainability and economic efficiency. Moreover, the C&#8722;N atropisomers represent a fascinating and crucial chiral system, extensively found in natural products, pharmaceutical leads, and the frameworks of advanced materials. In this work, we have introduced a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective carbon&#8208;oxygen arylation reaction for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;arylisoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones. The high regioselectivity of C&#8722;O cleavage benefits from the high stability of the in&#8197;situ formed (amido)ethenolate via oxidative addition. Additionally, the self&#8208;activation of the aryl C&#8722;O bond facilitates the reaction under mild conditions, leading to outstanding enantioselectivities. The diverse post&#8208;functionalizations of the axially chiral isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones further highlighted the utility of this protocol in preparing valuable C&#8722;N atropisomers, including the chiral phosphine ligands.

Indigo, an ancient, plant&#8208;derived fabric dye, can be used to make Fe coordination polymers on silver surfaces as reported by Biao Yang, Joachim Reichert, Shobhana Narasimhan, Johannes&#8197;V. Barth, Anthoula&#8197;C. Papageorgiou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202319162). Within such coordination polymers on the close&#8208;packed silver surface, thermally activated switches from&#160;trans&#160;to&#160;cis&#160;indigo are triggered and result in isomeric indigo&#8208;Fe coordination polymers.

         <title>Topologically Tunable Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Modulating Conductivity and Chemiresistive Properties for NH3 Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are formed by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings into their frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The conductivity can be modulated by adjusting the solvent system, thus regulating the dimensions and topologies of the cMOFs. 1D Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 can be easily processed into thin membranes. The 2D kgm&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 has an excellent response toward NH3 at room temperature.







Abstract
Electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) have garnered significant attention in materials science due to their potential applications in modern electrical devices. However, achieving effective modulation of their conductivity has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, we have successfully prepared cMOFs with high conductivity by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings in the frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems through ring&#8208;closing reactions. The conductivity of cMOFs can be precisely modulated ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 102&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 by regulating their dimensions and topologies. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent tunable electrical properties based on topology, we successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials as chemiresistive gas sensors with an outstanding response toward 100&#8197;ppm NH3 at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;Highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are formed by incorporating electron-donating fused thiophen rings into their frameworks and extending their &#960;-conjugated systems. The conductivity can be modulated by adjusting the solvent system, thus regulating the dimensions and topologies of the cMOFs. 1D &lt;b&gt;Cu-MOF-1&lt;/b&gt; can be easily processed into thin membranes. The 2D &lt;i&gt;kgm&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Cu-MOF-3&lt;/b&gt; has an excellent response toward NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) have garnered significant attention in materials science due to their potential applications in modern electrical devices. However, achieving effective modulation of their conductivity has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, we have successfully prepared cMOFs with high conductivity by incorporating electron-donating fused thiophen rings in the frameworks and extending their &#960;-conjugated systems through ring-closing reactions. The conductivity of cMOFs can be precisely modulated ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; by regulating their dimensions and topologies. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent tunable electrical properties based on topology, we successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials as chemiresistive gas sensors with an outstanding response toward 100&#8197;ppm NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature. This work not only provides valuable insights into the design of functional cMOFs with different topologies but also enriches the cMOF family with exceptional conductivity properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Integration of Phosphor, Initiator, and Crosslinker for the Photo&#8208;Polymerization of Flexible Phosphorescent Polymer Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general approach to constructing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials involves the incorporation of a phosphorescent emitter into a rigid host or polymers with high glass transition temperature. However, these materials often suffer from poor processability and suboptimal mechanical properties, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we developed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based dialkene (BTD&#8208;HEA), a multifunctional phosphorescent emitter with&#160;a remarkable yield of intersystem crossing (&#934;ISC, 99.83%). Its high triplet exciton generation ability and dialkene structure enable BTD&#8208;HEA to act as a photoinitiator and crosslinker, efficiently initiating the polymerization of various monomers within 120 seconds. A range of flexible phosphorescence gels, including hydrogels, organogels, ionogels, and aerogels were fabricated, which exhibit outstanding stretchability and recoverability.&#160;Furthermore, the unique fluorescent&#8208;phosphorescent colorimetric properties of the gels provide a more sensitive method for the visual determination of the polymerization process. Notably, the phosphorescent emission intensity of the hydrogel can be increased by the formation of ice, allowing for the precise detection of hydrogel freezing. The versatility of this emitter paves the way for fabricating various flexible phosphorescence gels with diverse morphologies using microfluidics, film&#8208;shearing, roll coating process, and two/three&#8208;dimensional printing, showcasing its potential applications in the fields of bioimaging and bioengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Degradable Polymers from Tricycloalkenes via Complete Cascade Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cascade metathesis polymerization has been developed as a promising method to synthesize complex but well&#8208;defined polymers from monomers containing multiple reactive functional groups. However, this approach has been limited to the monomers involving simple alkene/alkyne moieties or produced mainly non&#8208;degradable polymers. In this study, we demonstrate a complete cascade ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization (RORCMP) using various tricycloalkenes and two strategies for the efficient degradation. Through rational design of tricycloalkene monomers, the structure and reactivity relationship was explored. For example, tricycloalkenes with trans configuration in the central ring enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP than the corresponding cis isomers. Also, a 4&#8208;substituted cyclopentene moiety in the monomers significantly enhanced the overall cascade RORCMP performance, with the maximum turnover number (TON) reaching almost 10,000 and molecular weight up to 170 kg/mol using an amide&#8208;containing monomer. Furthermore, we achieved one&#8208;shot cascade multiple olefin metathesis polymerization using tricycloalkenes and a diacrylate, to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we successfully designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Polymer Chiral Co&#8208;assembly and Contactless Dynamic Chiral Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays a pivotal role in cutting&#8208;edge display and information technologies. Currently achieving precise color control and dynamic signal regulation in CPL still remains challenging due to the elusory relationship between fluorescence and chirality. Inspired by the natural mechanisms governing color formation and chiral interaction, we proposed an addition&#8208;subtraction principle theory to address this issue. Three fluorene&#8208;based polymers synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation with different electron&#8208;deficient monomers exhibit similar structures and UV&#8208;vis absorption, but distinct fluorescence emissions due to intramolecular charge transfer. Based on this, precise&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active films are obtained through quantitative supramolecular co&#8208;assembly directed by addition principle. Particularly, an ideal white&#8208;emitting CPL film (CIE coordinates: (0.33, 0.33)) is facilely fabricated with a high quantum yield of 80.8% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.4 &#215; 10&#8722;2. Structural analysis reveals that the ordered stacking orientation favors higher glum. Furthermore, to address the dynamically regulated challenge, the comparable subtraction principle is proposed, involving a contactless chiral communication between excited and ground states. The representative system consisting of as&#8208;prepared fluorene&#8208;based polymers and chirality&#8208;selective absorption azobenzene (Azo)&#8208;containing polymers is constructed, achieving CPL weakening, reversal, and enhancement. Finally, a switchable quick response code is realized based on trans&#8208;cis isomerization of Azo moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic peptides: promising modalities for the targeting of disease related nucleic acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA and RNA play pivotal roles in life processes by storing and transferring genetic information, modulating gene expression, and contributing to essential cellular machinery such as ribosomes. Dysregulation and mutations in nucleic acid&#8208;related processes are implicated in numerous diseases. Despite the critical impact on health of nucleic acid mutations or dysregulation, therapeutic compounds addressing these biomolecules remain limited. Peptides have emerged as a promising class of molecules for biomedical research, offering potential solutions for challenging drug targets. This review focuses on the use of synthetic peptides to target disease&#8208;related nucleic acids. We discuss examples of peptides targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, including the clinical candidate Omomyc, and compounds designed for regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes. Further, we provide insights into both library&#8208;based screenings and the rational design of peptides to target regulatory human RNA scaffolds and viral RNAs, emphasizing the potential of peptides in addressing nucleic acid&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

Despite the critical impact on health of nucleic acid mutations or dysregulation, therapeutic compounds addressing these biomolecules remain limited. Peptides have emerged as a promising class of molecules for biomedical research, offering potential solutions for challenging drug targets. This review focuses on the use of synthetic peptides to target disease-related nucleic acids. We discuss examples of peptides targeting double-stranded DNA, including the clinical candidate Omomyc, and compounds designed for regulatory G-quadruplexes. Further, we provide insights into both library-based screenings and the rational design of peptides to target regulatory human RNA scaffolds and viral RNAs, emphasizing the potential of peptides in addressing nucleic acid-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of DAT2, an Antigenic Glycolipid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DAT2 is a member of the diacyl trehalose family (DAT) of antigenic glycolipids located in the mycomembrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Recently it was shown that the molecular structure of DAT2 had been incorrectly assigned, but the correct structure remained elusive. Herein, the correct molecular structure of DAT2 and its methyl&#8208;branched acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid is determined. For this, four different stereo&#8208;isomers of mycolipanolic acid were prepared in a stereoselective and unified manner, and incorporated into DAT2. Rigorous comparison of the four isomers to the DAT isolated from Mtb H37Rv by NMR, HPLC, GC and mass spectrometry allowed a structural revision of mycolipanolic acid and DAT2. Activation of the macrophage inducible Ca2+&#8208;dependent lectin receptor (Mincle) with all four isomers shows that the natural stereochemistry of mycolipanolic acid / DAT2 provides the strongest activation, which indicates its high antigenicity and potential application in serodiagnostics and vaccine adjuvants.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Mysteries: Acetonitrile&#8217;s Dance with Weakly&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes in Shaping Gas Evolution and Electrochemical Performance of Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal battery (AZMB) is a promising candidate for future large&#8208;scale energy storage with commendable capacity, exceptional safety characteristics, and low cost. Acetonitrile (AN) has been widely used as an effective electrolyte contituent to improve AZMBs&#8217; performance. However, its functioning mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we unveiled the critical roles of AN in AZMBs via comparative in&#8208;situ electrochemical, gaseous, and morphological analyses. Despite its limited ability to solvate Zn ions, AN modulated Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheath with increased anions and decreased water, achieving a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte. As a result, the Zn||Zn cell with AN addition exhibited a 63 times longer cycle life than cell without AN and achieved a 4 Ah cm&#8208;2 accumulated capacity with no H2 generation. In V2O5||Zn cells, for the first time, AN suppressing CO2 generation, elevating CO2&#8208;starting voltage from 2&#8594;2.44 V (H2: 2.43&#8594;2.55 V) was discovered. AN&#8208;impeded transit and Zn&#8208;side deposition of dissolved vanadium ions, known as &#8220;crosstalk,&#8221; ameliorated inhomogeneous Zn deposition and dendritic Zn growth. At last, we demonstrated a AN&#8208;enabled high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity AZMB (3.3 mAh cm&#8208;2) using high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading V2O5 cathode (26 mg cm&#8208;2). This study shed light on strategy of constructing fast&#8208;desolvation electrolytes and offered insights for future electrolyte accommodation for high&#8208;voltage AZMB cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Viral Detection Using Electrochemical Kinetic Profiling of Aptamer&#8208;Antigen Recognition in Clinical Samples and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;precision viral detection at point of need with clinical samples plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the control of a global pandemic. However, the complexity of clinical samples that often contain very low viral concentrations makes it a huge challenge to develop simple diagnostic devices that do not require any sample processing and yet are capable of meeting performance metrics such as very high sensitivity and specificity. Herein we describe a new single&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step electrochemical method that uses real&#8208;time kinetic profiling of the interaction between a high&#8208;affinity aptamer and an antigen on a viral surface. This method generates many data points per sample, which when combined with machine learning, can deliver highly accurate test results in a short testing time. We demonstrate this concept using both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza A viruses as model viruses with specifically engineered high&#8208;affinity aptamers. Utilizing this technique to diagnose COVID&#8208;19 with 37 real human saliva samples results in a sensitivity and specificity of both 100% (27 true negatives and 10 true positives, with 0 false negative and 0 false positive), which showcases the superb diagnostic precision of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lobatamides A and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of lobatamides A (1a) and C (1c) via a common bislactone intermediate is reported. The allylic aryl moiety including a trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin is constructed by hydroboration of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allene and subsequent Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille coupling. Although the seco acid proved to be highly unstable even in the presence of weak bases, Zhao macrolactonization under acidic conditions via the a&#8208;acyloxyenamide successfully provided the common bislactone intermediate. Hydrozirconation&#8208;iodination of the terminal alkyne and subsequent copper&#8208;mediated coupling with primary amides successfully proceeded in the presence of the sensitive bislactone framework. The developed synthetic route enables the late&#8208;stage installation of enamide side chains, which are crucial structures for V&#8208;ATPase inhibitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Dual Defects of Bridging Organic and Terminal Inorganic Ligands in Iron&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nodes for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering advantageous defects to construct well&#8208;defined active sites in catalysts is promising but challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O due to the chemical inertness of N2 molecule. Here, we report defective Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalysts via a non&#8208;thermal plasma&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy, where their NH3 production capability is synergistically regulated by two types of defects, namely, bridging organic ligands and terminal inorganic ligands (OH&#8722; and H2O). Specially, the optimized MIL&#8208;100(Fe) catalysts, where there are only terminal inorganic ligand defects and coexistence of dual defects, exhibit the respective 1.7&#8208; and 7.7&#8208;fold activity enhancement comparable to the pristine catalyst under visible light irradiation. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the dual defects in the catalyst induce the formation of abundant and highly accessible coordinatively unsaturated Fe active sites and synergistically optimize their geometric and electronic structures, which favors the injection of more d&#8208;orbital electrons in Fe sites into the N2 &#960;* antibonding orbital to achieve N2 activation and the formation of a key intermediate *NNH in the reaction. This work provides a guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of porous catalysts with precise defective structures for high&#8208;performance activation of catalytic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enzymatic Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage and Aldol Reaction Cascade Converts an Angular Scaffold into the Linear Tetracyclic Core of Ochraceopones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Meroterpenoids of the ochraceopones family featuring a linear tetracyclic scaffold exhibit exceptional antiviral and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. The biosynthetic pathway and chemical logic to generate this linear tetracycle, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized all biosynthetic enzymes to afford ochraceopones and elucidated the complete biosynthetic pathway. We demonstrated that the linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones was derived from an angular tetracyclic precursor. A multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH was validated to catalyze the free radical&#8208;initiated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage of the angular tetracycle. Then, a new carbon&#8208;carbon bond was verified to be constructed using a new aldolase OchL, which catalyzes intramolecular an aldol reaction to form the linear tetracycle. This carbon&#8208;carbon bond fragmentation and aldol reaction cascade features an unprecedented strategy for converting a common angular tetracycle to a distinctive linear tetracyclic scaffold in meroterpenoid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Lowering Entropic Barriers in Triplex DNA Switches Facilitating Biomedical Applications at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplex DNA switches are attractive allosteric tools for engineering smart nanodevices, but their poor triplex&#8208;forming capacity at physiological conditions limited the practical applications. To address this challenge, we proposed a low&#8208;entropy barrier design to facilitate triplex formation by introducing a hairpin duplex linker into the triplex motif, and the resulting triplex switch was termed as CTNSds. Compared to the conventional clamp&#8208;like triplex switch, CTNSds&#160;increased the triplex&#8208;forming ratio from 30% to 91% at pH 7.4 and stabilized the triple&#8208;helix structure in FBS and cell lysate. CTNSds&#160;was also less sensitive to free&#8208;energy disturbances, such as lengthening linkers or mismatches in the triple&#8208;helix stem. The CTNSds&#160;design was utilized to reversibly isolate CTCs from whole blood, achieving high capture efficiencies (&gt;86%) at pH 7.4 and release efficiencies (&gt;80%) at pH 8.0. Our approach broadens the potential applications of DNA switches&#8208;based switchable nanodevices, showing great promise in biosensing and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with Low Crystallinity for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low molecular packing order are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. On the other hand, n&#8208;doped CPs usually exhibit inferior thermoelectric performance, restricting the development of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n&#8208;type CP (ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz) by alternating two acceptor units of thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and cyano&#8208;functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz shows a low&#8208;lying LUMO level below &#8208;4.20 eV and features low crystallinity, enabling the attainment of high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual&#8208;acceptor molecular design enhances polaron delocalization, thereby improving the thermoelectric performance of the polymer. After n&#8208;doping, ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz exhibits an electrical conductivity (s) of 50.6 S cm&#8208;1 and a power factor (PF) of 126.8 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2, which ranks among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type CPs to date. Additionally, solution&#8208;processed flexible OTE device employing doped ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz achieves a PF of 70 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2. Meanwhile, the flexible OTE devices present remarkable resistance to bending strain, with marginal change in &#963; after 600 bending cycles. The findings presented in this work will advance the development of n&#8208;type CPs for OTE devices, with a particular focus on flexible properties.</dc:description>

Herein, we report an n-type CP (ThDPP-CNBTz) by alternating two acceptor units of thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and cyano-functionalized benzothiadiazole.

Moreover, the dual-acceptor molecular design enhances polaron delocalization, thereby improving the thermoelectric performance of the polymer.

         <title>Regulating Lateral Adsorbate Interaction for Efficient Electroreforming of Bio&#8208;polyols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring the selectivity at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface is one of the greatest challenges for heterogeneous electrocatalysis, and complementary strategies to catalyst structural designs need to be developed. Herein, we proposed a new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways by lateral adsorbate interaction for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion possesses the alcoholic property that facilely adsorbs on the nickel oxyhydroxide catalyst, but is resistant to oxidation due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl groups.&#160;The alien HFIP adsorbents can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which achieved a &gt;2&#8208;fold enhancement of the oxalate selectivity to 55% for the representative glycerol oxidation and can be extended to various bio&#8208;polyol substrates.&#160;Through in&#8208;situ spectroscopic analysis and DFT calculation on the glycerol oxidation, we reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded adsorbate reaction can effectively tune the adsorption energies and tailor the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products. This work offers an additional perspective of tuning electrocatalytic reactions via introducing redox&#8208;innocent adsorbates to create lateral adsorbate interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Phenoxazine's Unique Reversible Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process and Stable Redox Intermediates for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low specific capacity determined by the limited electron transfer of p&#8208;type cathode materials is the main obstruction to their application towards high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). To overcome this challenge,  boosting multi&#8208;electron transfer is essential for improving the charge storage capacity. Here, as a typical heteroaromatic p&#8208;type material, we unveil the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox properties of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolyte for the first time. The second oxidation process is stabilized in the aqueous electrolyte, a notable contrast to its less reversibility in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. A comprehensive investigation of the redox chemistry mechanism demonstrates remarkably stable redox intermediates, including a stable cation radical PNO&#8226;+ characterized by effective electron delocalization and a closed&#8208;shell state dication PNO2+. Meanwhile, the heightened aromaticity contributes to superior structural stability during the redox process, distinguishing it from phenazine, which features a non&#8208;equivalent hybridized sp2&#8208;N motif. Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the PNO electrodes deliver a high capacity of 215 mAh g&#8208;1 compared to other p&#8208;type materials, and impressive long cycling stability with 100 % capacity retention over 3500 cycles. This work marks a crucial step forward in advanced organic electrodes based on multi&#8208;electron transfer phenoxazine moieties for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Amperometry and Electron Microscopy show Stress Granules Induce Homotypic Fusion of Catecholamine Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC) reveals larger molecule number and slower dynamics of vesicles opening after vesicles are treated with stress granules (SGs), implying homotypic fusion between vesicles, confirmed by observation of multi&#8208;core vesicles with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This finding provides new insights into how neural cells regulate exocytosis under oxidative stress and how SGs promote neurodegeneration.







Abstract
An overreactive stress granule (SG) pathway and long&#8208;lived, stable SGs formation are thought to participate in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). To understand if and how SGs contribute to disorders of neurotransmitter release in NDs, we examined the interaction between extracellular isolated SGs and vesicles. Amperometry shows that the vesicular content increases and dynamics of vesicle opening slow down after vesicles are treated with SGs, suggesting larger vesicles are formed. Data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly shows that a portion of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) with double/multiple cores appear, thus confirming that SGs induce homotypic fusion between LDCVs. This might be a protective step to help cells to survive following high oxidative stress. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed whereby enriched mRNA or protein in the shell of SGs is likely to bind intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions of vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) driving a disrupted membrane between two closely buddled vesicles to fuse with each other to form double&#8208;core vesicles. Our results show that SGs induce homotypic fusion of LDCVs, providing better understanding of how SGs intervene in pathological processes and opening a new direction to investigations of SGs involved neurodegenerative disease.

     alt="Amperometry and Electron Microscopy show Stress Granules Induce Homotypic Fusion of Catecholamine Vesicles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC) reveals larger molecule number and slower dynamics of vesicles opening after vesicles are treated with stress granules (SGs), implying homotypic fusion between vesicles, confirmed by observation of multi-core vesicles with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This finding provides new insights into how neural cells regulate exocytosis under oxidative stress and how SGs promote neurodegeneration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overreactive stress granule (SG) pathway and long-lived, stable SGs formation are thought to participate in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). To understand if and how SGs contribute to disorders of neurotransmitter release in NDs, we examined the interaction between extracellular isolated SGs and vesicles. Amperometry shows that the vesicular content increases and dynamics of vesicle opening slow down after vesicles are treated with SGs, suggesting larger vesicles are formed. Data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly shows that a portion of large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) with double/multiple cores appear, thus confirming that SGs induce homotypic fusion between LDCVs. This might be a protective step to help cells to survive following high oxidative stress. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed whereby enriched mRNA or protein in the shell of SGs is likely to bind intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions of vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) driving a disrupted membrane between two closely buddled vesicles to fuse with each other to form double-core vesicles. Our results show that SGs induce homotypic fusion of LDCVs, providing better understanding of how SGs intervene in pathological processes and opening a new direction to investigations of SGs involved neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer the use of real&#8208;time electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrochemical processes at individual single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with single photon sensitivity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), distinguished by their maximum atom efficiency and precise control over the coordination and electronic properties of individual atoms, show great promise in electrocatalysis. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical performance of SACs requires the screening of electron transfer process at micro/nano scale. This research pioneers the use of electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrocatalytic reactions at individual SACs. It boasts sensitivity at the single photon level and temporal resolution down to 100&#8197;ms, enabling real&#8208;time capture of the electrochemical behavior of individual SACs during potential sweeping. Leveraging the direct correlation between ECL emission and heterogeneous electron transfer processes, we introduced photon flux density for quantitative analysis, unveiling the electrocatalytic efficiency of individual SACs. This approach systematically reveals the relationship between SACs based on different metal atoms and their peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. The outcomes contribute to a fundamental understanding of SACs and pave the way for designing SACs with diverse technological and industrial applications.

         <title>Phase Identification and Discovery of an Elusive Polymorph of Drug&#8208;Polymer Inclusion Complex Using Automated 3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated low&#8208;dose 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) protocol was developed to identify and determine the structures of six phases of griseofulvin in a multiphasic melt&#8208;crystallisation product. 3D ED data were collected from over 230 individual nano&#8208;sized crystals and processed without supervision, enabling the discovery of a new griseofulvin polyethylene glycol inclusion complex. This study highlights 3D ED&#8242;s potential in drug development.







Abstract
3D electron diffraction (3D ED) has shown great potential in crystal structure determination in materials, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. In this work, an automated, low&#8208;dose and low&#8208;bias 3D ED protocol has been implemented to identify six phases from a multiple&#8208;phase melt&#8208;crystallisation product of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, griseofulvin (GSF). Batch data collection under low&#8208;dose conditions using a widely available commercial software was combined with automated data analysis to collect and process over 230 datasets in three days. Accurate unit cell parameters obtained from 3D ED data allowed direct phase identification of GSF Forms III, I and the known GSF inclusion complex (IC) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;I), as well as three minor phases, namely GSF Forms II, V and an elusive new phase, GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;II. Their structures were then directly determined by 3D ED. Furthermore, we reveal how the stabilities of the two GSF&#8208;PEG IC polymorphs are closely related to their crystal structures. These results demonstrate the power of automated 3D ED for accurate phase identification and direct structure determination of complex, beam&#8208;sensitive crystallisation products, which is significant for drug development where solid form screening is crucial for the overall efficacy of the drug product.

         <title>Solvent Effects on Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the interaction between H2O and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been first explored. The H2O molecular changes the electronic states of COFs and the possible catalytic center's locations. The COF based on the pyridine N linkers showed higher activity than those COFs based on other kinds of N atoms.







Abstract
Binding water molecules to polar sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is inevitable, but the corresponding solvent effects in electrocatalytic process have been largely overlooked. Herein, we investigate the solvent effects on COFs for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our designed COFs incorporated different kinds of nitrogen atoms (imine N, pyridine N, and phenazine N), enabling tunable interactions with water molecules. These interactions play a crucial role in modulating electronic states and altering the catalytic centers within the COFs. Among the synthesized COFs, the one with pyridine N atoms exhibits the highest activity, with characterized by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78&#8197;V and a mass activity of 0.32&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, which surpass those from other metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the enhanced activity can be attributed to the stronger binding ability of *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the pyridine N sites. This work sheds light on the significance of considering solvent effects on COFs in electrocatalytic systems, providing valuable insights into their design and optimization for improved performance.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Utilization of Latent Heat in Erythritol&#8208;based Phase Change Materials as Solar Thermal Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an erythritol&#8208;based phase change material as a new type of solar thermal fuels. The material can harvest, convert, and store solar energy as latent heat, which can be released as thermal energy on demand. The composite material is cost&#8208;effective, easy to synthesize, and has a superior solar thermal energy utilization performance. This new concept could promote related solar energy utilization techniques.







Abstract
Solar thermal fuels (STFs) have been particularly concerned as sustainable future energy due to their impressive ability to store solar energy in chemical bonds and controllably release thermal energy. However, currently studied STFs mainly focus on molecule&#8208;based materials with high photochemical activity, toxicity, and compromised features, which greatly restricts their applications in practical scenarios of solar energy utilization. Herein, we present a novel erythritol&#8208;based composite phase change material (PCM) as a new type of STFs with an outstanding capability to store solar energy as latent heat in its stable supercooling state and release thermal energy as needed. This composite PCM with stored thermal energy can be maintained stably at room temperature and subsequently release latent heat as high as 224.9&#8197;J/g during the crystallization process triggered by thermal stimuli. Remarkably, solar energy can be converted into latent heat stored in the composite PCM over months. Through mechanical stimulations, the released latent heat can increase the temperature of the composite up to 91&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a new concept of using spatiotemporal storage and release of latent heat in PCMs for solar energy utilization, making it a potential candidate as STFs for developing future clean energy techniques.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Two&#8208;Dimensional Defective Bi Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets were reconstructed in situ to defective Bi nanosheets, forming rich grain boundaries that were conducive to the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for CO2 and NO3&#8722; reduction to produce urea.







Abstract
Abstract:Catalyst surface dynamics drive the generation of active species for electrocatalytic reactions. Yet, the understanding of dominant site formation and reaction mechanisms is limited. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic reconstruction of two&#8208;dimensional defective Bi nanosheets from exfoliated Bi2Se3 nanosheets under electrochemical CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction conditions. The ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets obtained by NaBH4&#8208;assisted cryo&#8208;mediated liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are more easily reduced and reconstructed to Bi nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries (GBs; GB&#8208;rich Bi). The reconstructed GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 32&#8201;% for urea production at &#8722;0.40&#8197;V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2&#8197;times higher than those of the low&#8208;GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH2 intermediate formation energy and C&#8722;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure&#8208;activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets were reconstructed in situ to defective Bi nanosheets, forming rich grain boundaries that were conducive to the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction to produce urea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract:Catalyst surface dynamics drive the generation of active species for electrocatalytic reactions. Yet, the understanding of dominant site formation and reaction mechanisms is limited. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic reconstruction of two-dimensional defective Bi nanosheets from exfoliated Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets under electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction conditions. The ultrathin Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets obtained by NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-assisted cryo-mediated liquid-phase exfoliation are more easily reduced and reconstructed to Bi nanosheets with high-density grain boundaries (GBs; GB-rich Bi). The reconstructed GB-rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Faradaic efficiency of 32&#8201;% for urea production at &#8722;0.40&#8197;V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2&#8197;times higher than those of the low-GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate formation energy and C&#8722;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB-rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure-activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Inorganic Dimensionality of Ultrastable Lead Halide Coordination Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a coordination chemistry strategy to modulate the 2D to 3D transformation of lead iodide sublattices in robust coordination polymers. The synthetic strategy enhances the charge&#8208;transport properties for efficient carrier accumulation and introduces asymmetric charge distribution for C&#8722;C coupling, leading to efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction to C2 products.







Abstract
Lead halide hybrids have shown great potentials in CO2 photoreduction, but challenging to afford C2+ reduced products, especially using H2O as the reductant. This is largely due to the trade&#8208;off problem between instability of the benchmark 3D structures and low carrier mobility of quasi&#8208;2D analogues. Herein, the lead halide dimensionality of robust coordination polymers (CP) was modulated by organic ligands differing in a single&#8208;atom change (NH vs. CH2), in which the NH groups coordinate with interlamellar [PbI2] clusters to achieve the important 2D&#8594;3D transition. This first CP based on 3D cationic lead iodide sublattice possesses both high aqueous stability and a low exciton binding energy of 25&#8197;meV that is on the level of ambient thermal energy, achieving artificial photosynthesis of C2H5OH. Photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations suggest the bridging [PbI2] clusters in the 3D structure not only results in enhanced carrier transport, but also promotes the intrinsic charge polarization to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling. With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm with a high C2H5OH selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C2 products to date.

         <title>Orthogonal sp3&#8208;Ge/B Bimetallic Modules: Enantioselective Construction and Enantiospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acquisition of chiral sp3&#8208;Ge reagents for use in stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling represents a significant challenge. Herein, unprecedented enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were achieved through enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration, and chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of secondary alkyl&#8208;Ge was realized in a stereospecific manner with Bpin perfectly preserved. The synthetic value of these modules highlighted the significance of Ge/B bimetallic orthogonal strategy.







Abstract
In this study, a series of enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were successfully synthesized via an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of carbagermatrane (Ge)&#8208;containing alkenes. Orthogonal cross&#8208;coupling selectivity under different Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions was achieved in an enantiospecific manner. Notably, the chiral secondary Ge exhibited a remarkable transmetallation ability prior to primary or secondary Bpin. The effectiveness of this Ge/B bimetallic strategy was further demonstrated through the development of new functional small molecules with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) performance. This represents the first successful example of synthesis of enantioenriched alkylgermanium reagents that permit enantiospecific cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>CO&#8208;Induced Dimer Decay Responsible for Gem&#8208;Dicarbonyl Formation on a Model Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;lapse scanning tunneling microscopy movies are combined with theoretical computations to study CO adsorption on a model Rh1/Fe3O4(001) catalyst under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Direct CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results in monocarbonyl species. Rh1&#8722;(CO)2 gem dicarbonyl species are observed, but from only via the CO&#8208;induced break&#8208;up of Rh2 dimer species.







Abstract
The ability to coordinate multiple reactants at the same active site is important for the wide&#8208;spread applicability of single&#8208;atom catalysis. Model catalysts are ideal to investigate the link between active site geometry and reactant binding, because the structure of single&#8208;crystal surfaces can be precisely determined, the adsorbates imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and direct comparisons made to density functional theory. In this study, we follow the evolution of Rh1 adatoms and minority Rh2 dimers on Fe3O4(001) during exposure to CO using time&#8208;lapse STM at room temperature. CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results exclusively in stable Rh1CO monocarbonyls, because the Rh atom adapts its coordination to create a stable pseudo&#8208;square planar environment. Rh1(CO)2 gem&#8208;dicarbonyl species are also observed, but these form exclusively through the breakup of Rh2 dimers via an unstable Rh2(CO)3 intermediate. Overall, our results illustrate how minority species invisible to area&#8208;averaging spectra can play an important role in catalytic systems, and show that the decomposition of dimers or small clusters can be an avenue to produce reactive, metastable configurations in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Bifunctional Potential Structure Design Breaks Electrolyte Limitations of Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective molecular design strategy was proposed to provide a favorable reaction environment for high&#8208;capacity electrodes with a bifunctional potential region. The proton&#8208;doping chemistry of polyaniline resulted in localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, thus broadening the pH applicability of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are safe and economical for grid applications. However, current ZIBs have limitations in terms of inferior capacity and low output voltage, which are hampered by the electrolyte applicability of the Zn2+ hosts. In this study, we propose a novel organic cathode design strategy with a bifunctional potential region. This polymeric Zn2+ host combines the conjugated polyaniline backbone to tune the molecular surface pH and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; redox couple for high output voltage and capacity. The polyaniline doped with ferricyanide (PAF) electrode exhibits two forms of charge storage in ZIBs: proton&#8208;assisted Zn2+ doping below 1.2&#8197;V (mechanism I), and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; redox pair above 1.8&#8197;V (mechanism II). Density functional theory calculations and in situ pH experiments demonstrated that the H+ doping process of mechanism I forms a localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, providing a favorable reaction environment for mechanism II. The Zn&#8208;polymer battery delivered an outstanding discharge capacity (405.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high output voltage (1.8&#8197;V) in the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. This study provides a new route for enhancing the structural stability of electrodes and overcoming the electrolyte limitations of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Sodium Metal Battery Based on a NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 composite electrolyte, composed of the disordered NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3 and the ordered NaB3H8, was rapidly synthesized from the sticky NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NH3 after the partial removal of NH3 at room temperature and successfully used at rates above 1&#8197;C in a solid&#8208;state sodium metal battery. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial stability for high&#8208;rate sodium metal batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications owing to their intrinsic safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, they generally suffer from sodium dendrite growth or rapid capacity fading, especially at high rates, mainly due to poor wettability, sluggish ionic transport, or low interfacial stability of the solid electrolytes. Herein, we report a novel composite, NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 (x&lt;1), as a new class of solid electrolyte for high&#8208;rate batteries. NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 is obtained from the sticky NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NH3 after removal of NH3 partially at room temperature. It delivers an ionic conductivity of 0.84&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and reaches 20.64&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 45&#8201;&#176;C after an order&#8208;disorder phase transformation. It also reveals a good capability of dendrite suppression and remarkable stability against sodium metal. These performances enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na//TiS2 battery with a high capacity of 232.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (97.2&#8201;% of theoretical capacity) and long&#8208;term cycling stability at 1&#8197;C. Notably, this battery shows superior long&#8208;life cycling stability even at 5 and 10&#8197;C, which has been rarely reported in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes, contributing to fast&#8208;charging or high&#8208;power&#8208;density sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Build a High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Introducing Competitive Coordination Induction Effect in Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a new concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. The intrinsic mechanism of CCIE and its effects on both the Li+ conductivity and the interfacial stability at RT were clarified. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability and cycling performance at 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;inorganic composite electrolytes (PICE) have attracted tremendous attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to facile processability. However, the poor Li+ conductivity at room temperature (RT) and interfacial instability severely hamper the practical application. Herein, we propose a concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. CCIE introduction greatly enhances the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performances of ASSLBs at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Owing to the competitive coordination (Cs+&#8230;TFSI&#8722;&#8230;Li+, Cs+&#8230;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8230;Li+ and 2,4,6&#8208;TFA&#8230;Li&#8230;TFSI&#8722;) from the competitive cation (Cs+ from CsPF6) and molecule (2,4,6&#8208;TFA: 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoroaniline), a multimodal weak coordination environment of Li+ is constructed enabling a high efficient Li+ migration at 30&#8201;&#176;C (Li+ conductivity: 6.25&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1; tLi+=0.61). Since Cs+ tends to be enriched at the interface, TFSI&#8722; and PF6&#8722; in situ form LiF&#8208;Li3N&#8208;Li2O&#8208;Li2S enriched solid electrolyte interface with electrostatic shielding effects. The assembled ASSLBs without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability (LiFePO4: 147.44&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@1&#8197;C and 107.41mAhg&#8722;1@2&#8197;C) and cycling stability at 30&#8201;&#176;C (LiFePO4:94.65&#8201;%@200cycles@0.5&#8197;C; LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2: 94.31&#8201;%@200&#8197;cycles@0.3&#8197;C). This work proposes a concept of CCIE and reveals its mechanism in designing PICE with high ionic conductivity as well as high interfacial compatibility at near RT for high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.

         <title>Pt(II)/Pd(II)&#8208;Based Metallosupramolecular Architectures as Light Harvesting Systems and their Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light harvesting scaffold: Pd(II)/Pt(II)&#8208;based supramolecular scaffolds are well known for providing a wide pool of discrete architectures with numerous applications in catalysis, guest encapsulation, proton conductivity, explosive detection etc. This minireview summarizes various such light harvesting metallacycles, and metallacages that have opened up a new direction in terms of their structural design as well as exciting new applications.







Abstract
The development of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems mimicking the natural photosynthesis method is an ever&#8208;growing field of research. Numerous systems such as polymers, metal complexes, POFs, COFs, supramolecular frameworks etc. have been fabricated to accomplish more efficient energy transfer and storage. Among them, the supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) formed by non&#8208;covalent metal&#8208;ligand interaction, have shown the capacity to not only undergo single and multistep energy migration but also to utilize the harvested energy for a wide variety of applications such as photocatalysis, tunable emissive systems, encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, white light emitters etc. This review sheds light on the light&#8208;harvesting behavior of both the 2D metallacycles and 3D metallacages where design ingenuity has been executed to afford energy harvesting by both donor ligands as well as metal acceptors.

         <title>Formamidinium Lead Iodide&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25&#8201;% Enabled by An Amphiphilic Molecular Hole&#8208;Transporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phenothiazine&#8208;based molecular hole&#8208;transporter (PTZ&#8722;CPA) carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group is developed for the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells, resulting in the highest solar&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion efficiencies of 25.35&#8201;% under standard air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight.







Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) represents an optimal absorber material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the application of FAPbI3 in inverted&#8208;structured PSCs has yet to be successful, mainly owing to its inferior film&#8208;forming on hydrophobic or defective hole&#8208;transporting substrates. Herein, we report a substantial improvement of FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, which is realized by a multifunctional amphiphilic molecular hole&#8208;transporter, (2&#8208;(4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (PTZ&#8722;CPA). The phenothiazine (PTZ) based PTZ&#8722;CPA, carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid (CPA) group, forms a superwetting hole&#8208;selective underlayer that enables facile deposition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 thin films. Compared to a previously established carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective material (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8722;2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI3 is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ&#8722;CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four&#8208;fold) and Shockley&#8208;Read&#8208;Hall lifetime (eight&#8208;fold). Moreover, the PTZ&#8722;CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI3, benefiting the interfacial hole&#8208;collection. Consequently, FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35&#8201;% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ&#8722;CPA based device shows commendable long&#8208;term stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Highly Selective and Efficient Perdeuteration of n&#8208;Pentane via H/D Exchange Catalyzed by a Silica&#8208;Supported Hafnium&#8208;Iridium Bimetallic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hafnium&#8208;iridium complex immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach is used to prepare a novel hafnium&#8208;iridium catalyst immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, featuring well&#8208;defined [&#8801;SiOHf(CH2tBu)2(&#956;&#8208;H)3IrCp*] surface sites. Unlike the monometallic analogous materials Hf/SiO2 and Ir/SiO2, which promote n&#8208;pentane deuterogenolysis through C&#8722;C bond scission, we demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions (1&#8197;bar D2, 250&#8201;&#176;C, 3&#8197;h, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the heterobimetallic catalyst HfIr/SiO2 is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis (&lt;2&#8201;% at 95&#8201;% conversion). Furthermore this HfIr/SiO2 catalyst is robust and can be re&#8208;used several times without evidence of decomposition. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Double 1,2&#8208;Carbon Migration at Mixed Heavier Sn=Ge Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene to the germastannenylidene. Theoretical studies reveal that the isomerization process involves stepwise carboranyl group and aryl group migration. The reactivity studies demonstrate that the stannagermenylidene undergoes intriguing electron redistribution to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct upon treatment with IMe4 and readily reacts with (AlCp*)4 to give the unique heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;migration is one recurring isomerization reaction in organic chemistry. In contrast, double 1,2&#8208;migration remains rare and limited to transition&#8208;metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of mixed heavier Sn=Ge vinylidenes. Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene (3) to the germastannenylidene (4). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations revealed that 3 and 4 feature a Sn=Ge double bond. The reaction of 3 with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) results in the electron redistribution in the Sn=Ge core to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct (5). Moreover, treatment of 3 with 0.25&#8197;equiv. of (AlCp*)4 produces the heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne (6).

         <title>Photoelectron Migration Boosted by Hollow Double&#8208;Shell Dyads Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow double&#8208;shell dyads have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and transition metal sulfides, the double&#8208;shell architecture broadens light absorption, improves hydrogen evolution kinetics and reduces the photogenerated electron transfer resistance, resulting in high performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production based on noble metal&#8208;free systems is a promising technology for the conversion of solar energy into green hydrogen, it is pivotal and challenging to tailor&#8208;make photocatalysts for achieving high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we reported a hollow double&#8208;shell dyad through uniformly coating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the surface of hollow Co9S8. The double shell architecture enhances the scattering and refraction efficiency of incident light, shortens the transmission distance of the photogenerated charge carriers, and exposes more active sites for photocatalytic conversion. The hydrogen evolution rate is as high as 23.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is significantly enhanced when compared with that of their physical mixture (0.30&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Pt&#8208;based counterpart (11.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work provides a rational approach to the construction of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems based on COFs to enhance hydrogen evolution performance.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Boosted Active Hydrogen on Copper for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the severe accumulation of nitrite during nitrate reduction on Cu, S&#8208;doped Cu nanorod arrays (Cu&#8722;S NAs) were designed via an electrochemical conversion strategy. The high FE of ammonia (98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (1.4&#8201;%) can be achieved on Cu&#8722;S NAs. The introduction of S can significantly decrease the energy barrier of H2O dissociation to *H, leading to a favorable hydrogenation of *NO2 and enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia selectivity.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is a promising approach in term of pollutant appreciation. Cu&#8208;based catalysts performs a leading&#8208;edge advantage for nitrate reduction due to its favorable adsorption with *NO3.

     alt="Sulphur-Boosted Active Hydrogen on Copper for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate-to-Ammonia Selectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve the severe accumulation of nitrite during nitrate reduction on Cu, S-doped Cu nanorod arrays (Cu&#8722;S NAs) were designed via an electrochemical conversion strategy. The high FE of ammonia (98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (1.4&#8201;%) can be achieved on Cu&#8722;S NAs. The introduction of S can significantly decrease the energy barrier of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation to *H, leading to a favorable hydrogenation of *NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and enhanced nitrate-to-ammonia selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is a promising approach in term of pollutant appreciation. Cu-based catalysts performs a leading-edge advantage for nitrate reduction due to its favorable adsorption with *NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surface is difficult and insufficient, leading to the significant generation of by-product NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Herein, sulphur doped Cu (Cu&#8722;S) is prepared via an electrochemical conversion strategy and used for nitrate electroreduction. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia (~98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (~1.4&#8201;%) are achieved on Cu&#8722;S, obviously superior to its counterpart of Cu (FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;: 70.4&#8201;%, FE&lt;sub&gt;NO2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;: 18.8&#8201;%). Electrochemical in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that a small amount of S doping on Cu surface can promote the kinetics of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation to active hydrogen.

         <title>Highly Conductive Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains as Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains efficiently dissociate Li salts and transport Li+ for the durable operation of Li metal full cells.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are often used for Li+ conduction as they can dissociate the Li salts efficiently. However, high entanglement of the chains and lack of pathways for rapid ion diffusion limit their applications in advanced batteries. Recent developments in ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) showed that their highly ordered structures provide efficient pathways for Li+ transport, solving the limitations of traditional PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Here, we present imidazolate COFs, PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, having methoxyethoxy chains, synthesized by Debus&#8211;Radziszewski multicomponent reactions and their ionized form, Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, showing a high Li+ conductivity of 8.81&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a transference number of 0.974. The mechanism for such excellent electrochemical properties is that methoxyethoxy chains dissociate LiClO4, making free Li+, then those Li+ are transported through the imidazolate COFs&#8217; pores. The synthesized Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs formed a stable interface with Li metal. Thus, employing Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs as the solid electrolyte to assemble LiFePO4 batteries showed an initial discharge capacity of 119.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C, and 82.0&#8201;% capacity and 99.9&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency were maintained after 400&#8197;cycles. These results show that iCOFs with ether chains synthesized via multicomponent reactions can create a new chapter for making solid electrolytes for advanced rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Discriminating the Active Ru Species Towards the Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen from Peroxymonosulfate: Nanoparticles Surpass Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the single&#8208;atom structure, ruthenium nanoparticles with adjacent surface sites exhibit enhanced activation of O&#8722;O bonds in peroxymonosulfate. This promoted activation facilitates the selective production of singlet oxygen, resulting in a high degradation efficiency for electron&#8208;rich pollutants.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an exceptional reactive oxygen species in advanced oxidation processes for environmental remediation. Despite single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) representing the promising candidate for the selective generation of 1O2 from peroxymonosulfate (PMS), the necessity to meticulously regulate the coordination environment of metal centers poses a significant challenge in the precisely&#8208;controlled synthetic method. Another dilemma to SACs is their high surface free energy, which results in an inherent tendency for the surface migration and aggregation of metal atoms. We here for the first time reported that Ru nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the facile pyrolysis method behave as robust Fenton&#8208;like catalysts, outperforming Ru SACs, towards efficient activation of PMS to produce 1O2 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity, remarkably improving the degradation efficiency for target pollutants. Density functional theory calculations have unveiled that the boosted PMS activation can be attributed to two aspects: (i) enhanced adsorption of PMS molecules onto Ru NPs, and (ii) decreased energy barriers by offering adjacent sites for promoted dimerization of *O intermediates into adsorbed 1O2. This study deepens the current understanding of PMS chemistry, and sheds light on the design and optimization of Fenton&#8208;like catalysts.

         <title>A Polymeric Nanoparticle to Co&#8208;Deliver Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Peptides and Pt(IV) Prodrug: Toward High Loading Efficiency and Combination Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. Notably, the polymeric nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable combination efficacy on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model.







Abstract
Developing combination chemotherapy systems with high drug loading efficiency at predetermined drug ratios to achieve a synergistic effect is important for cancer therapy. Herein, a polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. The depolymerization of polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle and the activation of Pt prodrug can be effectively triggered by the acidic tumor environment extracellularly and the high levels of glutathione intracellularly in cancer cells, respectively. The utilization of mitochondria&#8208;targeting peptide can inhibit ATP&#8208;dependent processes including drug efflux and DNA damage repair. This leads to increased accumulation of Pt&#8208;drugs within cancer cells. Eventually, the polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable antitumor effects on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model. It is highly anticipated that the polymeric dual&#8208;or multi&#8208;drug systems can be applied for combination chemotherapy to achieve enhanced anticancer activity and reduced side effects.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor in Organic Photovoltaic Cells by Tuning Molecular Electrostatic Potential Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), significant progress has been made in tailoring molecular structures to enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage and the short&#8208;circuit current density. However, there remains a crucial gap in the development of coordinated material design strategies focused on improving the fill factor (FF). Here, we introduce a molecular design strategy that incorporates electrostatic potential fluctuation (ESPF) to design organic photovoltaic materials. By reducing the ESPF amplitude of IT&#8208;4F, we synthesized a new acceptor named ITOC6&#8208;4F. When using PBQx&#8208;TF as a donor, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell shows a markedly low recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8208;14 cm3 s&#8208;1 and demonstrates an outstanding FF of 0.816, both of which are new records for binary OPV cells. Also, we find that flat ESPF could decrease the energetic disorder of OPV cells, reducing energy loss. Finally, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell creates the highest efficiency of 16.0% among medium&#8208;gap OPV cells. Our work holds a vital implication for guiding the design of high&#8208;performance OPV materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Exfoliation of Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and CH4 Valorization Mediated by O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8208;decomposition (NID) strategy is developed to exfoliate bulk C3N4 (BCN) into oxygen&#8208;rich, porous, few&#8208;layered C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tunable thickness. The optimal fl&#8208;CN catalyst is effective not only in producing H2O2 by O2 reduction, but also in selective oxidation CH4 with O2 to C1 oxygenates with a record&#8208;high production rate of 1893&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work represents a significant advance in the synthesis and application of new C3N4&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The exfoliation of bulk C3N4 (BCN) into ultrathin layered structure is an effective strategy to boost photocatalytic efficiency by exposing interior active sites and accelerating charge separation and transportation. Herein, we report a novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8208;decomposition (NID) strategy that is effective in peeling off BCN into few&#8208;layer C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tailored thickness down to bi&#8208;layer. This strategy only involves hydrothermal treatment of BCN in diluted HNO3 aqueous solution, followed by pyrolysis at various temperatures. The decomposition of the nitrate anions not only exfoliates BCN and changes the band structure, but also incorporates oxygen species onto fl&#8208;CN, which is conducive to O2 adsorption and hence relevant chemical processes. In photocatalytic O2 reduction under visible light irradiation, the H2O2 production rate over the optimal fl&#8208;CN&#8208;530 catalyst is 952&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 8.8&#8197;times that over BCN. More importantly, under full arc irradiation and in the absence of hole scavenger, CH4 can be photocatalytically oxidized by on&#8208;site formed H2O2 and active oxygen species to generate value&#8208;added C1 oxygenates with high selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% and record&#8208;high production rate of 1893&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 among the metal&#8208;free C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts.

Abstract: C&#8722;C linked glutarimide&#8208;containing structures with direct utility in the preparation of cereblon&#8208;based degraders (PROTACs, CELMoDs) can be assessed in a single step from inexpensive, commercial &#945;&#8208;bromoglutaramide through a unique Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid assisted Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic approach. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups that are historically problematic and can be applied to the simplified synthesis of dozens of known compounds that have only been procured through laborious, wasteful, multi&#8208;step sequences. The reaction is scalable in both batch and flow and features a trivial procedure wherein the most time&#8208;consuming aspect of reaction setup is weighing out the starting materials.

         <title>Dimeric Giant Molecule Acceptors Featuring N&#8208;type Linker: Enhancing Intramolecular Coupling for High&#8208;Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant molecular acceptors are typically designed with different linkers to tune their intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. Unlike prior approaches using p&#8208;type linkers, here we explore an n&#8208;type linker, notably the benzothiadiazole unit, affording BT&#8208;DL via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation. It exhibits stronger intramolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling compared to its benzene&#8208;linked counterpart, leading to better device efficiency.







Abstract
Giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) are typically designed through the conjugated linking of individual small molecule acceptors (SMAs). This design imparts an extended molecular size, elevating the glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to their SMA counterparts. Consequently, it effectively suppresses the thermodynamic relaxation of the acceptor component when blended with polymer donors to construct stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Despite their merits, the optimization of their chemical structure for further enhancing of device performance remains challenge. Different from previous reports utilizing p&#8208;type linkers, here, we explore an n&#8208;type linker, specifically the benzothiadiazole unit, to dimerize the SMA units via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation, affording BT&#8208;DL. In comparison with B&#8208;DL with a benzene linkage, BT&#8208;DL exhibits significantly stronger intramolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling, a desirable property for the acceptor component. Furthermore, BT&#8208;DL demonstrates a higher film absorption coefficient, redshifted absorption, larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of BT&#8208;DL translate into a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.49&#8201;% in PSCs, a substantial improvement over the 9.17&#8201;% efficiency observed in corresponding devices with B&#8208;DL as the acceptor. Notably, the BT&#8208;DL based device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1000&#8197;hours of thermal stress at 90&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a cost&#8208;effective approach to the synthesis of n&#8208;type linker&#8208;dimerized GMAs, and highlight their potential advantage in enhancing intramolecular coupling for more efficient and durable photovoltaic technologies.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Supported Silver Catalysts through Al modification for Efficient Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we synthesized an Ag/Al&#8722;MnO2 catalyst by metal&#8208;modification engineering to simultaneously improve the catalytic activity and selectivity for ethylene epoxidation. Experimental and theoretical resultsshowed that the Al modification tailored the 3d state of Ag on MnO2 through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs). These targeted effects enhanced the catalytic selectivity and overcame the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in heterogeneous catalysis, providing a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for heterogeneous oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;modified catalysts have attracted extraordinary research attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their enhanced geometric and electronic structures and outstanding catalytic performances. Silver (Ag) possesses necessary active sites for ethylene epoxidation, but the catalyst activity is usually sacrificed to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene oxide (EO). Herein, we report that using Al can help in tailoring the unoccupied 3d state of Ag on the MnO2 support through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs), overcoming the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for ethylene epoxidation and resulting in a very high ethylene conversion rate (~100&#8201;%) with 90&#8201;% selectivity for EO under mild conditions (170&#8201;&#176;C and atmospheric pressure). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the EMSIs obtained by the Al modification tailor the unoccupied 3d state of Ag, modulating the adsorption of ethylene (C2H4) and oxygen (O2) and facilitating EO desorption, resulting in high C2H4 conversion. Meanwhile, the increased number of positively charge Ag+ lowers the energy barrier for C2H4(ads) oxidation to produce oxametallacycle (OMC), inducing the unexpectedly high EO selectivity. Such an extraordinary electronic promotion provides new promising pathways for designing advanced metal catalysts with high activity and selectivity in selective oxidation reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, tumor cell membrane possessing the unique structure and diverse functions has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target. In this review, diverse treatments aiming at cell membrane based on functional materials are summarized and discussed, ranging from well&#8208;known photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT), in situ self&#8208;assembly/biosynthesis to newly emerged lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation.







Abstract
The cell membrane is a crucial component of cells, protecting their integrity and stability while facilitating signal transduction and information exchange. Therefore, disrupting its structure or impairing its functions can potentially cause irreversible cell damage. Presently, the tumor cell membrane is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for various treatment methods. Given the extensive research focused on cell membranes, it is both necessary and timely to discuss these developments, from materials design to specific biomedical applications. This review covers treatments based on functional materials targeting the cell membrane, ranging from well&#8208;known membrane&#8208;anchoring photodynamic therapy to recent lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation. The diverse therapeutic mechanisms are introduced in the following sections: membrane&#8208;anchoring phototherapy, self&#8208;assembly on the membrane, in situ biosynthesis on the membrane, and degradation of cell membrane proteins by chimeras. In each section, we outline the conceptual design or general structure derived from numerous studies, emphasizing representative examples to understand advancements and draw inspiration. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future directions in membrane&#8208;targeted therapy from our perspective. This review aims to engage multidisciplinary readers and encourage researchers in related fields to advance the fundamental theories and practical applications of membrane&#8208;targeting therapeutic agents.

         <title>Lattice Strained Induced Spin Regulation in Co&#8722;N/S Coordination&#8208;Framework Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment in Co coordination polymers is regulated by compressive lattice strain to change the spin charge densities around S atoms, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with *OOH intermediates to promote the ORR performance.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperature&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT=2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) with 2&#8201;% lattice compression exhibits a superior half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spin&#8208;charge densities around S atoms for Co&#8208;DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.

         <title>MXene&#8208;mediated Interfacial Growth of 2D&#8208;2D Heterostructured Nanomaterials as Cathodes for Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the MXene&#8208;mediated interfacial growth of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructured nanomaterials. Benefitting from the synergistic effects and interfacial interactions, 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8722;NiCo) heterostructures achieved outstanding structural stability and chemical reversibility in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel approach for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene heterostructures featuring a sandwiched and cross&#8208;linked network structure. This method addresses the common issue of activity degradation in 2D nanomaterials caused by inevitable aggregation. By utilizing the distinct surface characteristics of MXene, we successfully induced the growth of various 2D nanomaterials on MXene substrates. This strategy effectively mitigates self&#8208;stacking defects and augments the exposure of surface areas. In particular, the obtained 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8722;NiCo) heterostructures exhibit enhanced structural stability, improved chemical reversibility, and heightened charge transfer efficiency, outperforming pure NiCo LDH. The aqueous MH&#8722;Ni4Co1//Zn@carbon cloth (MH&#8722;Ni4Co1//Zn@CC) battery demonstrates exceptional performance with a remarkable specific capacity of 0.61&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining 96.6&#8201;% capacitance after 2300&#8197;cycles. Additionally, it achieves an energy density of 1.047&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 32.899&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research not only paves the way for new design paradigms in energy&#8208;related nanomaterials but also offers invaluable insights for the application and optimization of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures in advanced electrochemical devices.

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Polymers Constructed from Dynamic Coordination Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing materials capable of adapting their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli is the key to preventing failure and extending their service life. However, existing mechanically adaptive polymers are hindered by limitations such as inadequate load&#8208;bearing capacity, difficulty in achieving reversible changes, high cost, and a lack of multiple responsiveness. Herein, we address these challenges using dynamic coordination bonds. A new type of mechanically adaptive material with both rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsiveness was developed. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the coordination equilibria, the prepared polymers, PBMBD&#8208;Fe and PBMBD&#8208;Co, exhibit mechanically adaptive properties, including temperature&#8208;sensitive strength modulation and rate&#8208;dependent impact hardening. Benefitting from the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, the polymers exhibited impressive energy dissipation, damping capacity (loss factors of 1.15 and 2.09 at 1.0 Hz), self&#8208;healing, and 3D printing abilities, offering durable and customizable impact resistance and protective performance. The development of impact&#8208;resistant materials with comprehensive properties has potential applications in the sustainable and intelligent protection fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationally Designed Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable and efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production is of great importance and challenge. In this study, synthesis of three photoactive cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) in an alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) fashion is presented. In combination with triazine&#8208;derived electron acceptor, PAF&#8208;363 exhibits high efficiency for photosynthesis of H2O2 with a production rate of 11733 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1(with sacrificial agent) and 3930 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (without sacrificial agent) from water and oxygen under visible light irradiation. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer positions and the O2 adsorption sites in PAF&#8208;363 are both concentrated on COTh fragments, which facilitate the H2O2 production through oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. This work highlights that the rational design of COTh&#8208;PAFs with consideration of D&#8208;A direction, charge transfer positions, and O2 adsorption sites provides a feasible access to efficient H2O2 production photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting Lewis Acidity: Machine&#8208;Learning the Fluoride Ion Affinity of p&#8208;Block&#8208;Atom&#8208;based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;How strong is this Lewis acid?&#8221; is a question researchers often approach by calculating its fluoride ion affinity (FIA) with quantum chemistry. Here, we present FIA49k, an extensive FIA dataset with 48,986 data points calculated at the RI&#8208;DSD&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c level of theory, including 13 different p&#8208;block atoms as the fluoride accepting site. The vast amount of data allowed for hitherto unmatched correlations with other Lewis acidity descriptors, serving the qualitative understanding of Lewis acidity. The FIA49k dataset was used to train FIA&#8208;GNN, two message&#8208;passing graph neural networks, which predict gas and solution phase FIA values of molecules excluded from training with a mean absolute error of 14&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1 (r2 = 0.93) from the SMILES strings of the Lewis acid as the only input. The level of accuracy is notable, given the wide energetic range of 750&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1 spanned by the FIA49k dataset. The model&#8217;s value was demonstrated with four case studies, including predictions for molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by reproducing results from catalysis research available in the literature. Weaknesses of the model are evaluated and interpreted chemically. FIA&#8208;GNN and the FIA49k dataset can be reached via a free web app (grebgroup.de/fia&#8208;gnn).</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely engineering asymmetric atomic CoN4 by electron donating and extracting for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonpyrolytic catalysts featuring precisely defined active sites represents an effective strategy for investigating the fundamental relationship between the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and their local coordination environments. In this study, we have synthesized a series of model electrocatalysts with well&#8208;defined CoN4 centers and nonplanar symmetric coordination structures. These catalysts were prepared by a sequential process involving the chelation of cobalt salts and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based ligands with various substituent groups (phen(X), where X = OH, CH3, H, Br, Cl) onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). By modulating the electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the substituent groups on the phen&#8208;based ligands, we were able to effectively control the electron density surrounding the CoN4 centers. Our results demonstrated a direct correlation between the catalytic activity of the CoN4 centers and the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group on the phenanthroline ligands. Notably, the catalyst denoted as BCTF&#8208;Co&#8208;phen(OH), featuring the electron&#8208;donating OH group, exhibited the highest ORR catalytic activity. This custom&#8208;crafted catalyst achieved a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of up to 0.80 V vs. RHE and an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) value of 47.4&#215;10&#8208;3 Hz at 0.80 V vs. RHE&#160;in an alkaline environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Chalcogen Squares for Material and Topological Control over Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we introduce chalcogen squares via selenadiazole motifs as a new class of dynamic supramolecular bonding interactions for the modification and control of soft matter materials. We showcase selenadiazole motifs in supramolecular networks of varying primary chain length prepared through polymerization using tandem step&#8208;growth/Passerini multicomponent reactions (MCRs). Compared to controls lacking the selenadiazole motif, these networks display increased glass transition temperatures and moduli due to the chalcogen bonding linkages formed between chains. These elastomeric networks were shown to autonomously heal at room temperature, retaining up to 83% of the ultimate tensile strength. Lastly, we use post&#8208;polymerization modification via the Biginelli MCR to add selenadiazole motifs to narrowly dispersed polymers for controlled topology in solution. Chalcogen squares via selenadiazoles introduce an exciting exchange mechanism to the realm of dynamic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Self&#8208;Expanding Metal&#8211;Organic Cages Using a Ring&#8208;Openable Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs), which are formed via coordination&#8208;driven assembly, are being extensively developed for various applications owing to the utility of their accessible molecular&#8208;sized cavity. While MOC structures are uniquely and precisely predetermined by the metal coordination number and ligand configuration, tailoring MOCs to further modulate the size, shape, and chemical environment of the cavities has become intensively studied for a more efficient and adaptive molecular binding. Herein, we report self&#8208;expanding MOCs that exhibit remarkable structural variations in cage size and flexibility while maintaining their topology. A cyclic ligand with an oligomeric chain tethering the two benzene rings of stilbene was designed and mixed with RhII ions to obtain the parent MOCs. These MOCs were successfully transformed into expanded MOCs via the selective cleavage of the double bond in stilbene. The expanded MOCs could effectively trap multidentate N&#8208;donor molecules in their enlarged cavity, in contrast to the original MOCs with a narrow cavity. As the direct synthesis of expanded MOCs is impractical because of the entropically disfavored structures, self&#8208;expansion using ring&#8208;openable ligands is a promising approach that allows precision engineering and the production of functional MOCs that would otherwise be inaccessible.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Cofeeding Affects Product Distribution in CH3Cl Coupling over ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite: Pressure Twists the Plot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C1 coupling reactions over zeolite catalysts are central to sustainable chemical production strategies. However, questions persist regarding the involvement of CO in ketene formation, and the impact of this elusive oxygenate intermediate on reactivity patterns. Using&#160;operando&#160;photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), we investigate&#160;the role of CO in methyl chloride conversion to hydrocarbons (MCTH), a prospective process for methane valorization with a reaction network akin to methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) but without oxygenate intermediates. Our findings reveal the transformative role of CO in MCTH at the low pressures, inducing ketene formation in MCTH and boosting olefin production, confirming the Koch carbonylation step in the initial stages of C1 coupling. We uncover pressure&#8208;dependent product distributions driven by CO&#8209;induced ketene formation, and its subsequent desorption from the zeolite surface, which is enhanced at low pressure. Inspired by the above results, extension of the co&#8208;feeding approach to CH3OH as another simple oxygenate showcases the additional potential for improved catalyst stability in MCTH at ambient pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Intermediate Adsorption over PdM (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) Bimetallene for Boosted Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NO3RR) is a promising and eco&#8208;friendly strategy for ammonia production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the eight&#8208;electron transfer process and poor mechanistic understanding strongly impedes its application. To unveil the internal laws, herein, a library of Pd&#8208;based bimetallene with various transition metal dopants (PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)) are screened to learn their structure&#8208;activity relationship towards NO3RR. The ultra&#8208;thin structure of metallene greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites, and the transition metals dopants break the electronic balance and upshift its d&#8208;band center, thus optimizing intermediates adsorption. The anisotropic electronic characteristics of these transition metals make the NO3RR activity in the order of PdCu &gt; PdCo &#8776; PdFe &gt; PdNi &gt; Pd, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 295 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 along with Faradaic efficiency of 90.9% is achieved in neutral electrolyte on PdCu bimetallene. Detailed studies further reveal that the moderate N&#8208;species (*NO3 and *NO2) adsorption ability, enhanced *NO activation, and reduced HER activity facilitate the NH3 production. We believe our results will give a systematic guidance to the future design of NO3RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH by Rhenium Atomically Dispersed on Indium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven photoreduction of CO2 is promising in alleviating environment burden, but suffers from low efficiency and over&#8208;reliance on sacrificial agents. Herein, rhenium (Re) is atomically dispersed in In2O3 to fabricate a 2Re&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst. In sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2 with H2O, 2Re&#8208;In2O3 shows a long&#8208;term stable efficiency which is enhanced by 3.5 times than that of pure In2O3 and is also higher than those on Au&#8208;In2O3, Ag&#8208;In2O3, Cu&#8208;In2O3, Ir&#8208;In2O3, Ru&#8208;In2O3, Rh&#8208;In2O3 and Pt&#8208;In2O3 photocatalysts. Moreover, carbon&#8208;based product of the photoreduction overturns from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. Re promotes charge separation, H2O dissociation and CO2 activation, thus enhancing photoreduction efficiency of CO2 on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. During the photoreduction, CO is a key intermediate. CO prefers to desorption rather than hydrogenation on pure In2O3, as CO binds to pure In2O3 very weakly. Re strengthens the interaction of CO with 2Re&#8208;In2O3 by 5.0 times, thus limiting CO desorption but enhancing CO hydrogenation to CH3OH. This could be the origin for photoreduction product overturn from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. The present work opens a new way to boost sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chiral B&#8208;N Adduct as a New Frontier in Ferroelectrics and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the burgeoning field of electronic materials, B&#8208;N Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, distinguished by their partial charge distribution across boron and nitrogen centers, represent an underexplored class with significant potential. These materials exhibit inherent dipoles and are excellent candidates for ferroelectricity. However, the challenge lies in achieving the optimal combination of hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base pairs to yield B&#8208;N adducts with stable dipoles. Herein, we present an enantiomeric pair of B&#8208;N adducts [R/SC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (R/SMBA&#8208;BF3) crystallizing in the polar monoclinic P21 space group. The ferroelectric measurements on RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave a rectangular P&#8208;E hysteresis loop with a remnant&#160;polarization of 7.65 &#181;C cm&#8208;2, a value that aligns with the polarization derived from the extensive density&#8208;functional theory computations. The PFM studies on the drop&#8208;casted film of RMBA&#8208;BF3 further corroborate the existence of ferroelectric domains, displaying characteristic amplitude&#8208;bias butterfly and phase&#8208;bias hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA&#8208;BF3&#160;was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5 pC N&#8208;1&#160;for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as&#8208;made crystals of RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2 V. This work thus underscores the untapped potential of B&#8208;N adducts in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Second Coordination Sphere for Tunable Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Charge Transfer toward Enhanced Photoelectrochemical H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely limits the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by optimizing the charge transfer dynamics at the solid&#8208;liquid interface via molecular catalyst design. Specifically, the surface of a p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated using molecular catalysts with different metal atoms and organic ligands to improve H2 production performance. Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 is identified as an efficient and durable catalyst for H2 production through the rational design of metal centers and first/second coordination spheres. The modulation with Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2, which contains an electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8208;SO3H group in the second coordination sphere, elevates the flat&#8208;band potential of the polished p&#8208;Si photocathode and nanoporous p&#8208;Si photocathode by 81 mV and 124 mV, respectively, leading to the maximized energy band bending and the minimized interfacial carrier transport resistance. Consequently, both the two photocathodes achieve the Faradaic efficiency of more than 95% for H2 production, which is well maintained during 18 h and 21h reaction, respectively. This work highlights that the band&#8208;edge engineering by molecular catalysts could be an important design consideration for semiconductor&#8208;catalyst hybrids toward PEC H2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Hetero[9]helicene Toward Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes BN[9]H have been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step approach. The intrinsic helical structure and its multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence endows it with outstanding chiroptical properties. Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with M&#8208;/P&#8208;BN[9]H used as emitters exhibit a high EQEmax of 35.5&#8201;% and intense circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with a |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
The intrinsic helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton makes helicenes highly promising for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). Generally, carbon helicenes undergo low external quantum efficiency (EQE), while the incorporation of a multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) BN structure has led to an improvement. However, the reported B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes all show low electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL), typically around 1&#215;10&#8722;3. Therefore, the development of B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes with both a high EQE and gEL value is crucial for achieving highly efficient CPEL. Herein, a facile approach to synthesize B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes, BN[9]H, is presented. BN[9]H shows a bright photoluminescence with a maximum at 578&#8197;nm with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 5.8&#215;10&#8722;3, attributed to its inherited MR&#8208;TADF property and intrinsic helical skeleton. Furthermore, circularly polarized OLED devices incorporating BN[9]H as an emitter show a maximum EQE of 35.5&#8201;%, a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm, and, more importantly, a high |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3. The Q&#8208;factor (|EQE&#215;gEL|) of CP&#8208;OLEDs is determined to be 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, which is the highest among helicene analogues. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.

         <title>A non&#8208;metal single atom nanozyme for cutting off the energy and reducing power of tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE) was developed as a biosafe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts. SeSAE exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimic activity, effectively disrupting cellular energy and reduction equivalents to suppress tumors. The comprehensive investigation of SeSAE, from theoretical calculations to in vivo antitumor pathways, promises valuable insights into the translation of single atom nanozymes.







Abstract
Enzymes are considered safe and effective therapeutic tools for various diseases. With the increasing integration of biomedicine and nanotechnology, artificial nanozymes offer advanced controllability and functionality in medical design. However, several notable gaps, such as catalytic diversity, specificity and biosafety, still exist between nanozymes and their native counterparts. Here we report a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE), which exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimetic activity. This novel single atom nanozyme provides a safe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts and effectively cuts off the cellular energy and reduction equivalents through its distinctive catalytic function in tumors. In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase&#8208;like activity of the non&#8208;metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.

         <title>Multielectron Redox&#8208;Bipolar Tetranitroporphyrin Macrocycle Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin macrocycle is designed, which fuses quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties. A high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, improved average voltage, outstanding energy density and durable cyclability.







Abstract
Bipolar organics fuse the merits of n/p&#8208;type redox reactions for better Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs), but face the capacity plafond due to low density of active units and single&#8208;electron reactions. Here we report multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin (TNP) with quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties towards high&#8208;capacity&#8208;voltage ZOBs. TNP cathode initiates high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage involving four nitro sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential and two amine species coupling with SO42&#8722; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), boosted average voltage (1.08&#8197;V), and outstanding energy density (365&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1TNP). Moreover, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 71.6&#8201;% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar organics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs.

Dual&#8208;atom catalysts present a promising catalytic platform for improving activity and selectivity simultaneously. In their Research Article (e202401168), Xiaohao Liu et&#8197;al. develop a universal &#8220;photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition&#8221; strategy to precisely construct In2O3&#8208;supported diatomic Ir&#8208;Pd sites. The strong synergism on the Angstrom scale accelerates *H spillover and electron transfer from Pd to Ir. This as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a record&#8208;breaking performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

         <title>Two Sesterterpene Synthases from Lentzea atacamensis Demonstrate the Role of Conformational Variability in Terpene Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of Lentzea atacamensis uncovered two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases with the main products lentzeadiene and atacamatriene. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was observed, reminiscent of vitamin D3 biosynthesis. The cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations, showing the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.







Abstract
Mining of two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases from Lentzea atacamensis resulted in the identification of the synthases for lentzeadiene (LaLDS) and atacamatriene (LaATS). The main product of LaLDS (lentzeadiene) is a new compound, while one of the side products (lentzeatetraene) is the enantiomer of brassitetraene B and the other side product (sestermobaraene F) is known from a surprisingly distantly related sesterterpene synthase. LaATS produces six new compounds, one of which is the enantiomer of the known sesterterpene Bm1. Notably, for both enzymes the products cannot all be explained from one and the same starting conformation of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating the requirement of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the enzymes&#8217; active sites. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was discovered, reminiscent of the biosynthesis of vitamin D3. All enzyme reactions and the [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results also emphasize the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.

         <title>Peptide Stapling by Crosslinking Two Amines with &#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes through Diverse Modified Glyoxal&#8208;Lysine Dimer Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by the crosslinking of two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents has been developed. Except for Cys, all unprotected proteinogenic amino acids are tolerated. The reactivity of Arg side chains can be effectively suppressed. The use of HFIP solvent is the key to achieving high reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes play versatile roles in the ubiquitous natural processes of protein glycation. However, leveraging the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes for biomedical applications has been challenging. Previously, the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes with guanidine has been harnessed to design probes for labeling Arg residues on proteins in an aqueous medium. Herein, a highly effective, broadly applicable, and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by crosslinking two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents is described. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent facilitates rapid and clean reactions under mild conditions and enables unique selectivity for Lys over Arg. The naturally occurring GOLD/MOLD linkers have been expanded to encompass a wide range of modified glyoxal&#8208;lysine dimer (OLD) linkers. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, these modular stapling reactions enabled a convenient two&#8208;round strategy to streamline the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study of the wasp venom peptide anoplin, leading to enhanced biological activities.

         <title>Cyclic Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;Bromanes as a Precursor for Regiodivergent Alkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity. Herein we reported the complemental character of hypervalent bromines, as aryne precursors and their behavior under transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.







Abstract
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity while using identical coupling partners. We have developed a new approach for regiodivergent synthesis using the dual character of hypervalent bromines. In addition to the recently reported reactivity of hypervalent bromines as aryne precursors, the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported. Accordingly, the development of these two complementary transformations allows for the alteration of regioselectivity to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.

         <title>Accessing Mg&#8208;Ion Storage in V2PS10 via Combined Cationic&#8208;Anionic Redox with Selective Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium batteries attract interest as alternative energy&#8208;storage devices because of elemental abundance and potential for high energy density. Development is limited by the absence of suitable cathodes, associated with poor diffusion kinetics resulting from strong interactions between Mg2+ and the host structure. V2PS10 is reported as a positive electrode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries. Cyclable capacity of 100 mAh g&#8208;1 is achieved with fast Mg2+ diffusion of 7.2[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;11&#8208;4[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;14 cm2s&#8208;1. The fast insertion mechanism results from combined cationic redox on the V site and anionic redox on the (S2)2&#8208; site; enabled by reversible cleavage of S&#8211;S bonds, identified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Detailed structural characterisation with maximum entropy method analysis, supported by density functional theory calculations and projected density of states analysis, reveals that the sulphur species involved in anion redox are not connected to the transition metal centres, spatially separating the two redox processes. This facilitates fast and reversible Mg insertion in which the nature of the redox process depends on the cation insertion site, creating a synergy between the occupancy of specific Mg sites and the location of the electrons transferred.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable Afterglow Nanotorches for In Vivo Tracing of Cell&#8208;Based Microrobots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the self&#8208;luminescence imaging approaches that require pre&#8208;illumination instead of real&#8208;time light excitation, afterglow luminescence imaging has attracted increasing enthusiasm to circumvent tissue autofluorescence. In this work, we developed organic afterglow luminescent nanoprobe (nanotorch), which could emit persistent luminescence more than 10 days upon single light excitation. More importantly, the nanotorch could be remote charged by 660 nm light in a non&#8208;invasive manner, which showed great potential for real&#8208;time tracing the location of macrophage cell&#8208;based microrobots.</dc:description>

         <title>Changing Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with a Reversible Rotaxane Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transmission of chiral information between the molecular, meso and microscopic scales is a facet of biology that remains challenging to understand mechanistically and to mimic with artificial systems. Here we demonstrate that the dynamic change in the expression of the chirality of a rotaxane can be transduced into a change in pitch of a soft matter system. Shuttling the position of the macrocycle from far&#8208;away&#8208;from to close&#8208;to a point&#8208;chiral center on the rotaxane axle changes the expression of the chiral information that is transmitted across length scales; from nanometer scale constitutional chirality that affects the conformation of the macrocycle, to the centimeter scale chirality of the liquid crystal phase, significantly changing the pitch length of the chiral nematic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrating Excited State Energy on Non&#8208;Radiative Decay Pathways with Fused Azulenyl Squaraine Derivatives for Improving Second Near&#8208;Infrared Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) theranostics offer new opportunities for precise disease phototheranostic due to the enhanced tissue penetration and higher maximum permissible exposure of NIR&#8208;II light. However, traditional regimens lacking effective NIR&#8208;II absorption and uncontrollable excited&#8208;state energy decay pathways often result in insufficient theranostic outcomes. Herein a phototheranostic nano&#8208;agent (PS&#8208;1 NPs) based on azulenyl squaraine derivatives with a strong NIR&#8208;II absorption band centered at 1092 nm is reported, allowing almost all absorbed excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, leading to high photothermal conversion efficiency (90.98%) and strong photoacoustic response. Both in vitro and in vivo photoacoustic/photothermal therapy results demonstrate enhanced deep tissue cancer theranostic performance of PS&#8208;1 NPs. Even in the 5 mm deep&#8208;seated tissue tumor model, PS&#8208;1 NPs demonstrated a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor effect in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy. Moreover, for the human extracted tooth root canal infection model, the synergistic outcomes of the photothermal effect of PS&#8208;1 NPs and 0.5% NaClO solution resulted in therapeutic efficacy comparable to the clinical gold standard irrigation agent 5.25% NaClO, opening up possibilities for the expansion of NIR&#8208;II theranostic agents in oral medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Double Redox Reaction of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show wide application as the cathode of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) in the future owning to their high porosity, diverse structures, abundant species, and controllable morphology. However, the low energy density and poor cycling stability hinder the feasibility in practical application. Herein, an innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed and demonstrated to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, its energy storage mechanism is systematically investigated. Moreover, profiting from the coordination effect, the Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 features with stable structure in ZnSO4 electrolyte. Therefore, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability. This work aids in the future development of MOFs in AZIBs</dc:description>
