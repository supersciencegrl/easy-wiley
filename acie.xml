         <title>Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks: Design Strategy, Structure Feature, and Applications in Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the synthesis strategies, structural characteristics, and structural regulation strategies of metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), as well as their electrochemical energy storage performance in various energy storage devices (LIBs, LMBs, ZABs, Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, LSBs, ZIBs, and SCs).








Abstract
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which can integrate the properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), exhibit high stability, adjustable pore structures, and catalytic activity of metal sites owing to the synergistic interaction between metal sites and covalent backbones. In this regard, MCOFs have gained significant attention as promising electrode materials, where metal ions (Mn+) function as molecular structure switches, providing MCOFs with diverse active sites and modifying their charge density by incorporating different Mn+, thereby imparting unique energy&#8208;storage properties to MCOFs. Furthermore, by optimizing the synthesis strategies of MCOFs, their topological and dimensional structures can be regulated to ensure the stability of the MCOFs. In the challenging landscape of energy storage, MCOFs have surpassed the performance limitations of traditional COFs. Through precise atomic&#8208;level control of metal sites and innovative design of dynamic covalent chemistry, they can significantly enhance the performance of batteries, achieving remarkable performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, and other applications. This review systematically summarizes the research advancements of MCOFs in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices, including lithium&#8208;ion, Li&#8211;CO2, and Zn&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, it examines the synthesis strategies, structural regulation, and structural characteristics of MCOFs to address the challenges encountered in various energy storage devices.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Suppressing Energy Migration via Antiparallel Spin Alignment in One&#8208;Dimensional Mn2+ Halide Magnets with High Luminescence Efficiency&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of one&#8208;dimensional (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) doped with Cd2+ remains consistently high (&#8764;95%) across the studied composition range (x&#160;=&#160;Cdx/Mn1&#8208;x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.22). By combining PL lifetime measurements, high&#8208;pressure optical absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction structural analysis, we demonstrate that the PLQY exhibits only minimal dependence on x. This finding contrasts with recent reports,1 claiming that the PLQY initially rises with Cd2+ content up to x&#160;=&#160;0.08, then declines sharply from 95% to 77% at x&#160;=&#160;0.22.








Abstract
The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of tetramethyl ammonium manganese(II) chloride, (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC), doped with Cd2+/Cu2+ is analyzed through photoluminescence measurements, X&#8208;ray diffraction, optical absorption, and time&#8208;resolved excitation and emission under hydrostatic pressure. Contrary to recent studies reporting a PLQY increase up to x&#160;=&#160;Cdx/Mn1&#8208;x&#160;=&#160;0.08 followed by a decline (from 95% to 77% at x&#160;=&#160;0.22),1 we demonstrate that the PLQY remains consistently high (&#8805;95%) across the concentration range x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.22.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Sided Multidentate Coordination Strategy Enables Record Birefringence in UV&#8208;Transparent Antimony&#8208;Based Hybrid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;shaped UV&#8208;transparent hybrid birefringence crystal, (C10H6NO2)2SbF (QCSF), with a record&#8208;breaking birefringence of 0.87 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported halide birefringent crystals with SCALPs, was successfully designed and synthesized through a dual&#8208;sided multidentate coordination strategy.








Abstract
Achieving ultrahigh birefringence in UV&#8208;transparent materials remains fundamentally constrained by the trade&#8208;off between strong optical anisotropy and wide bandgap transparency. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly&#8208;shaped UV organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals&#8212;(C6H4NO2)2SbF (PCSF) and (C10H6NO2)2SbF (QCSF)&#8212;in which planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record&#8208;high birefringence of &#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.87 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported lone&#8208;pair&#8208;containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN2O2F] coordination geometry, near&#8208;planar molecular configuration, and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next&#8208;generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.

         <title>Selective Sieving Effect of Multi&#8208;Atomic Bismuth Interfaces for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis and Evolution at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;atomic Bi interfaces (Bi0/Bi&#948;+&#8722;O moiety) embedded in porous Bi2O3&#8208;x nanosheets featuring interfacial atomic sieving effect enabling efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion across pH ranges. The simultaneous production of formate on both the cathode and anode was also achieved by coupling CO2 reduction reaction with the methanol oxidation reaction under industrial current density conditions. Further intermediacy of the concentrated formate for C&#8211;N coupling toward urea synthesis, establishing pathway for sustainable evolution.








Abstract
Constructing multi&#8208;atomic interfaces architectures is promising for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion, yet their synthesis and stability under industrial current densities remain challenging. Herein, multi&#8208;atomic Bi interfaces (Bi0/Bi&#948;+&#8722;O moiety) were precisely engineered by embedding atomically dispersed Bi centers, encompassing Bi single atoms and Bi atomic clusters into the substrate of porous Bi2O3&#8208;x nanosheets. The composite showcases outstanding CO2 conversion performance across a wide pH range, attaining remarkable Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEformate) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long&#8208;term stability over 150&#160;h. Depending on the designed CH3OH electrooxidation catalyst (CuOx/ZnCo(OH)x) at the anode to couple with CO2 conversion, symmetrical/asymmetrical electrolyzers were developed. The approach could obtain high&#8208;added value products with FEformate&#160;&gt;90% at both electrodes, achieving a production rate of 4980&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under industrial current density. Combined in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that multiple atomic interfaces featuring interfacial atomic sieving effects effectively enhance preferential binding of *H and *CO2 to form *OCHO, while simultaneously suppressing the undesired recombination of hydrogen species into H2, rationalizing the high selectivity. Further intermediacy of concentrated formate precursors for subsequent C&#8211;N coupling toward urea synthesis, establishing a pathway for sustainable evolution.

The approach could obtain high-added value products with FE&lt;sub&gt;formate&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;90% at both electrodes, achieving a production rate of 4980&#160;&#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under industrial current density. Combined in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that multiple atomic interfaces featuring interfacial atomic sieving effects effectively enhance preferential binding of *H and *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form *OCHO, while simultaneously suppressing the undesired recombination of hydrogen species into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, rationalizing the high selectivity.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Para&#8208;Xylene, Ethylbenzene, and Explicit Exclusion of Ortho&#8208;Xylene from Xylene Isomers Using a Pillar&#8208;Layered MOF with Tuned Pore Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Channel confinement via rigid cylindrical pillaring in a MOF framework enables molecular sieving through elliptical windows, offering a blueprint for ambient&#8208;condition xylene isomer separation.








Abstract
Xylene isomer separation is a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the nearly identical properties of para&#8208;xylene (PX), meta&#8208;xylene (MX), ortho&#8208;xylene (OX), and ethylbenzene (EB). Here, we report a rationally designed pillar&#8208;layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni&#8208;HDB, incorporating a cylindrical 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) pillar that blocks lateral channels and directs molecular transport through elliptical windows (3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;6.7&#160;&#197;2). These apertures closely match the dimensions of PX and EB, enabling kinetic sieving. As a result, Ni&#8208;HDB exhibits high selectivity for PX and EB, moderate selectivity for MX, and exclusion of OX under ambient conditions. It achieves record liquid&#8208;phase selectivities for EB/OX (1943), PX/OX (951), and MX/OX (158), along with high PX and MX adsorption capacities. Comparative studies with isoreticular analogues confirm that DABCO&#8208;driven confinement is key to enhancing size&#8208;based selectivity. Density functional theory calculations indicate kinetic preference for PX and EB, thermodynamic favorability for MX, and exclusion of OX. Ni&#8208;HDB also shows excellent thermal and structural stability, with no performance loss over ten cycles. These results highlight the importance of channel geometry in MOFs and provide a framework for developing next&#8208;generation adsorbents for energy&#8208;efficient hydrocarbon separations.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Abasic Site&#8208;Reactive Probe (mTAP) Enables the Manipulation of Mitochondrial DNA Levels</title>

         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeting water&#8208;soluble probe mTAP exclusively reacts with mitochondrial abasic sites, enabling the manipulation of mitochondrial DNA levels under genotoxic stress. 








Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential genes for mitochondrial and cellular functions and acts as a cell signaling molecule in innate immune and inflammatory responses. Defects in mtDNA are implicated in a range of mitochondrial disorders and human diseases. Currently, no chemical strategy exists to prevent mtDNA loss under genotoxic stress. To address this, we developed a mitochondria&#8208;targeting probe (mTAP) that selectively reacts with key mtDNA repair intermediates&#8211;abasic (AP) sites. We confirmed that mTAP forms oxime conjugates exclusively with mitochondrial AP sites without conjugation with nuclear AP sites. Upon mTAP conjugation, DNA substrates containing AP sites were resistant to cleavage by AP endonuclease (APE1) and mitochondrial extracts. This conjugation significantly reduced the DNA&#8208;binding affinity of APE1 without affecting the DNA&#8208;binding activity of a mtDNA&#8208;packaging factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Importantly, cellular experiments demonstrated that mTAP treatment alleviated the decrease in mtDNA and transcription product levels induced by mitochondrial AP site damage. Functional assays also demonstrated that mTAP treatment did not compromise mtDNA replication activity or increase the overall mtDNA damage level. These findings highlight the potential of mTAP as a valuable chemical tool to modulate mtDNA levels under genotoxic stress.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Hydrogen Oxidation for Hydroxide Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Catalyzed by Fivefold&#8208;Twinned Nickel Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fivefold&#8208;twinned nickel (Ni) nanoparticles exhibit a pronounced pull&#8208;up strain near the twin boundary (TB), with a gradual increase in the strain effect near the TB. The fivefold&#8208;twinned nanoparticles demonstrate an increased hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) and stable hydrogen binding energy (HBE) at the TB due to the strain effect, generating abundant and highly active sites in proximity to the TB. Special strain effect plays a crucial role in accelerating the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) process.








Abstract
The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer&#8211;N&#248;rskov d&#8208;band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold&#8208;twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high jk,m value of 106.6&#160;mA mgNi&#8722;1, which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with fivefold&#8208;twinned Ni nanoparticles anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with H2/O2 gas feed, which is the highest among Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts reported thus far. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits excellent&#160;long&#8208;term&#160;cycling&#160;performance, taking a giant step forward toward the commercialization of platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free HEMFCs.

         <title>Chiral Tin&#8208;Oxo Cluster Matrices with Fluorophore Embedment for Multichromatic Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric tin&#8208;oxo clusters form helical supramolecular matrices through directional intermolecular interactions, enabling efficient transfer of optical handedness to encapsulated non&#8208;chiral fluorophores via spatial confinement. These assemblies exhibit tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;oxo clusters, characterized by their well&#8208;defined chemical compositions and architectures, are multi&#8208;metal aggregates composed of Sn&#8208;oxide cores and surface ligands. Chirality, a fundamental characteristic governing biological recognition and signal transduction, remains underexplored in stannate clusters compared to extensively studied precious metal clusters. Herein, three enantiomeric pairs of chiral tin&#8208;oxo clusters were constructed using axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) ligands. Structural analyses revealed supramolecular helical assemblies mediated by directional C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, while circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed their intrinsic chirality. Through in situ doping engineering, non&#8208;chiral fluorophores with distinct emission profiles were incorporated during chiral cluster crystallization, yielding composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The optimized system achieved a maximum dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies established that the spiral packing of the tin&#8208;oxo clusters facilitates stereochemical information transfer to the dyes via the spatial confinement effect. This supramolecular chirality induction paradigm offers new insights into the rational design of multifunctional optical materials.

A novel &#8220;In&#8208;Lattice heterojunction&#8221; was constructed by patching cavities in defective TiO2 with Fe&#9472;N4&#8208;anchored carbon layer. It effectively catalyzes the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and achieves an NH3 yield of 88&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 by facilitating efficient radial carrier transfer and enhancing N2 adsorption.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation and carrier transfer are critical determinants of the performance of photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) which are critical for agricultural and chemical industries. In this study, a novel type of heterostructure, termed an &#8220;In&#8208;Lattice heterojunction&#8221;, has been constructed by introducing a Fe&#9472;N4&#8208;anchored carbon layer (Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C) onto the surface of defective TiO2 (D&#8208;TiO2), as well as implanting it into the cavities of D&#8208;TiO2. The in&#8208;lattice heterojunction, defined as FNCTO, achieves efficient radial carrier transfer along the Ti&#9472;C&#9472;N&#9472;Fe in&#8208;lattice atomic channel and greatly promoted N2 adsorption benefiting photocatalytic NRR. Thus, FNCTO exhibits an excellent photocatalytic N2 reduct`ion into NH3 activity (88&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), obviously higher than that of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C sites on noncavity P25, illustrating the crucial role of cavity patch induced in&#8208;lattice heterojunction. This study paves a way for the development of high&#8208;performance Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C atomic photocatalysts based on noncarbon materials.

         <title>A Homobimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Cobalt Catalyst for the Methanolysis of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] shows excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, reaching TOF values of ca. 50&#160;000&#160;h&#8722;1. This behavior can be ascribed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which allows for a frustrated Lewis pair mechanism, resulting in a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond, as substantiated by DFT calculations. 








Abstract
The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (1) has shown excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, surpassing the related bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)(PMe2Ph)(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (2), the Co(II) complex [Co(Cl)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)] (3), and the Co(I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)]Cl (4). A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PNHP ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(&#8211;I) centers. Then, the PhSiH2 group at the Co(&#8211;I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ cation, regenerating the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; species. [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH&#8208;assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.

         <title>Restructured Three&#8208;Coordinated Ni&#9472;Se Catalytic Sites for Enhanced Cross&#8208;Condensation of Methanol and Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;doping reconstructs the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites that effectively catalyze MeOH and EtOH conversion to aldehyde intermediates while suppressing further decomposition, thus significantly promoting their cross&#8208;condensation to C5+ higher alcohols.








Abstract
The cross&#8208;condensation of methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH) offers a promising, carbon&#8208;neutral pathway for the production of higher alcohols (HAS) from both CO2 and biomass resources. However, this process is often hampered by the low efficiency of C5+ alcohol (C5+OH) synthesis, high catalyst production costs, and limited water tolerance. Here, we report for the first time a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance Ni&#8208;based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C5+OH) in the cross&#8208;condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross&#8208;condensation to C5+OH.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Bathing Strategy with Ultra&#8208;Wide Processing Window for Making High&#8208;efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent bathing strategy with ultra&#8208;wide processing window (10 s&#8211;10&#160;min) is proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The bathing process is in situ monitored via time&#8208;resolved UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, systematically unrevealing the crystallization kinetics for different antisolvents. The PCE of CF&#8208;bathed device achieves 24.49% in ambient air, representing the record for antisolvent bathing method.








Abstract
Most record&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin&#8208;coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during R2R fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed the antisolvent&#8208;bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent&#8208;antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in&#8208;situ crystallization monitoring via time&#8208;resolved UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30%&#8211;50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by the antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256&#160;h storage in N2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied by an ultra&#8208;wide processing window (10&#160;s&#8211;10&#160;min bathing duration, &gt;2&#160;min post&#8208;bathing delay tolerance).

We report the design and fabrication of a self&#8208;powered blue&#8208;light photodetector based on boronate&#8208;ester&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;5) film, synthesized using hexahydroxytriphenylene and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediboronic acid organic linkers. The p&#8208;COF&#8208;5/n&#8208;Si photodetector exhibits an ultra&#8208;short rise time of 41&#160;&#181;s and a decay time of 222 &#181;s under 0&#160;V bias.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework materials have recently garnered significant interest from the scientific community due to their fascinating properties that include highly ordered porosity, structural versatility, high chemical and thermal stabilities, and facile surface modification. Herein, for the first time, we present the design and fabrication of a self&#8208;powered blue&#8208;light photodetector based on boronate&#8208;ester&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;5) film, synthesized using hexahydroxytriphenylene and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediboronic acid organic linkers. Specifically, we have developed a COF&#8208;5/n&#8208;Si photodetector that exhibits an ultra&#8208;short rise response time of 41&#160;&#181;s and a decay response time of 222 &#181;s under 0&#160;V bias. Our work integrated rapid response times and the distinctive benefit of self&#8208;powering, setting it apart from existing COF&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Production of Ethylene from Bicarbonate Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report direct electroreduction of bicarbonate to C2+ products using Cu mesh catalysts. The effect of mesh thickness, pore size, catholyte composition, and thermal treatment was systematically studied. Our finding shows that thinner Cu mesh showed enhanced C2+ selectivity due to improved mass transport, while heat&#8208;treated meshes form oxide&#8208;derived surfaces that shift selectivity from hydrogen evolution to efficient eCO2R.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction directly from a reactive carbon solution (e.g., (bi)carbonate) provides a promising approach for integrating CO2 capture and conversion. Compared to CO2 conversion in gas&#8208;fed systems, this system typically suffers from low Faradaic efficiency (FE), especially for multicarbon (C2+) products. Here, we report an engineered material structuring to selectively produce C2+ products directly from a N2&#8208;saturated bicarbonate solution. Multiphysics modeling studies reveal the critical role of local current density distribution and the spatio&#8208;selective evolution of C2+ products, which is favored in thinner catalysts (240&#160;&#181;m thickness). By jointly tailoring catalyst configuration and mass transport in bicarbonate electroreduction, adjusting the thickness, porosity, and surface oxidation of copper (Cu) mesh catalysts, as well as catholyte composition, we achieved a maximum C2H4 FE of 39% and total C2+ FE over 55% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a 240&#160;&#181;m thick Cu mesh. The system is also stable for over 160&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with maintained C2H4 FE over 20%. Our electrolysis system converts bicarbonate to C2+ with over 90% CO2 utilization efficiency, reducing regeneration and separation costs. Optimizing catalyst pore structure, and copper surface oxide is a key to maximizing C2H4 production from bicarbonate solutions.

         <title>Precision Screening and Surgical Resection of Pan&#8208;Cancer Using a Tandem&#8208;Locked NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probe with Optimized Activation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic cyanine&#8208;based NIR II fluorescent probe, ACy&#8208;H&#8208;NTR, employs a &#8220;tandem&#8208;locked and doubly quenched&#8221; strategy combined with an &#8220;interstitial activation&#8211;lysosome retention&#8221; mechanism, enabling high&#8208;precision pan&#8208;cancer imaging and surgical resection. 








Abstract
The development of fluorescent probes for cancer detection and imaging that balance high sensitivity, precision, and broad applicability remains a significant challenge. Although &#8220;dual&#8208;locked&#8221; probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan&#8208;cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy&#8208;H&#8208;NTR, a cascaded&#8208;activation, doubly quenched NIR&#8208;II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity&#8212;universal tumor hallmarks&#8212;it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan&#8208;cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem&#8208;locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan&#8208;tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR&#8208;II emission and &#8220;activation&#8211;retention&#8221; mechanism enhance tumor imaging efficacy and effectively tackle issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan&#8208;cancer models, it enabled high&#8208;contrast imaging (T/N &#8764;7.8) and precise resection with sub&#8208;2&#160;mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem&#8208;locked and doubly quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR&#8208;II imaging capabilities, and activation&#8208;retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan&#8208;cancer identification and surgical navigation.

         <title>A Guest Cation Screening Principle for Enabling Customized Cathode/Electrolyte Interface Chemistry and Self&#8208;Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural instability and slow reaction kinetics restrict the application of MnO2 cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This research proposes a guest cation screening principle, identifying Sr2+ as the promising intercalation ion. As demonstrated, it enables in situ forming customized SrSO4 CEI that suppresses Mn dissolution and boosts the de&#8208;solvation of hydrated zinc ions, yet stabilizes the MnO2 host structure.








Abstract
Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO2 cathode in high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high&#8208;efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de&#8208;solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self&#8208;optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr&#8208;MnO2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A g&#8722;1), better rate capability (115&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A g&#8722;1), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2&#160;A g&#8722;1, when compared with pure &#948;&#8208;MnO2 electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode in high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high-efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de-solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self-optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), better rate capability (115&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, when compared with pure &#948;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Hydration of Terpenes with Cofactor&#8208;Independent Carotenoid 1,2&#8208;Hydratase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a highly regioselective and cofactor&#8208;independent enzymatic approach to terpene and terpenoid hydration using a carotenoid 1,2&#8208;hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus. Beyond detailing reaction optimization strategies, an extensive substrate scope, and scale&#8208;up potential, it explores mutagenesis and structural modeling to identify key catalytic residues and improve enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Terminally hydrated terpenes are highly sought&#8208;after compounds in the flavor and fragrance industries. However, their selective synthesis remains a considerable challenge in catalysis. Regioselective hydration of non&#8208;activated C&#9472;C double bonds is typically hindered by poor selectivity and low atom efficiency in conventional methods. In this study, we harness the underexplored potential of the acyclic carotenoid 1,2&#8208;hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus IL144, employing it as a whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst for cofactor&#8208;independent terminal hydration of a diverse range of terpenes. This enzyme demonstrates exceptional activity across more than 20 C12&#9472;C20 terpenes and shows notable tolerance to various functional groups, establishing it as a valuable tool for sustainable organic synthesis. We emphasize the critical influence of expression system choice in maximizing enzymatic performance, enabling high&#8208;yield transformations on the gram scale. Through a combination of homology modeling, consensus analysis, and targeted mutagenesis, essential residues involved in catalytic activity were identified. Notably, enhanced catalytic efficiency was only achievable through the epistatic effect of three specific mutations. These findings highlight the biocatalytic potential of acyclic carotenoid hydratase, offering a green and efficient route to the production of valuable tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Ordered Copper Triangular Atomic Sites for Industrial&#8208;Grade Electromethanation of CO2 via Self&#8208;Regulated Adsorption of Reactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered copper triangular atomic site motifs loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI) were synthesized via a precise ion exchange strategy. Cu TAS/PHI enables enhanced CO2 coverage and activation with balanced proton supply through self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, as well as unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, achieving an FECH4 of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an FECD4 of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Copper single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown considerable potential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methane but face constraints of low selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities (&gt;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and limited economic viability. Herein, we report an ion exchange strategy to precisely construct ordered Cu triangular atomic sites loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI), achieving a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and &gt;60% across 100&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, it enables CO2 deuteration to high&#8208;value methane&#8208;d4 with an FE of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an estimated annual return on investment of 425.35%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu triangular atomic sites enable strengthened adsorption and activation of CO2, as well as balanced proton supply via self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, thus favoring CO2 deep hydrogenation over hydrogen evolution. Moreover, Cu TAS/PHI unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, circumventing the conventional *CO pathway that typically yields diverse CO2RR products. This work demonstrates a strategy to construct ordered multiatomic sites for highly selective CO2RR at industrial&#8208;grade current density and highlights the extraordinary financial potential of electrocatalytic CO2RR to produce high&#8208;value deuterated chemicals.

         <title>Multipoint Coordinative Capture of Olefinic Substrates Utilizing Metal&#8208;Carbon Bonds by Macrocyclic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a macrocyclic tetranuclear palladium complex, which has four coordination sites within its inner cavity as a host molecule. The complex captured squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with six C&#9552;C double bonds, through multipoint palladium&#8208;carbon bonds, and formed a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. The host also selectively captured methyl &#945;&#8208;linolenate over methyl oleate and methyl linoleate.








Abstract
Terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids containing C&#9552;C double bonds are biologically and synthetically important compounds. The transformation of these substrates catalyzed by proteins relies on precise molecular capture. However, achieving precise molecular recognition of C&#9552;C double bonds using synthetically designed hosts remains a significant challenge. We now report a macrocyclic palladium tetranuclear complex that functions as a synthetic receptor featuring coordination sites within its inner cavity. This receptor selectively binds specific double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates. Squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with chemically similar six isoprenoid units, was captured by the macrocyclic complex through the coordination of four out of the six C&#9552;C double bonds, leading to a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. Furthermore, the macrocyclic complex exhibited stronger binding affinity for methyl linolenate compared to methyl oleate or methyl linoleate through multipoint coordinative capture. This unprecedented approach to multipoint coordination of specific unsaturated bonds contrasts sharply with biological and traditional artificial receptors, which typically rely on intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic effects. By achieving precise capture and folding of flexible olefinic substrates, this study establishes a new paradigm for the design of artificial host molecules and a novel platform for enzyme&#8208;like reaction vessels.

         <title>Biocatalytic Alkylation of Ambident Nucleophiles Enables Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Heterocycles and Late&#8208;Stage Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes are key structural motifs in bioactive compounds, but their regioselective synthesis via coupling of readily available azoles with haloalkanes remains very challenging. Here, we present a mild biocatalytic approach that proceeds on gram&#8208;scale, is highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, offering rapid access to valuable N&#8208;alkylated building blocks and enabling demanding late&#8208;stage alkylations.








Abstract
The alkylation with electrophilic haloalkanes is a key methodology in chemical synthesis to build desired molecules. Although alkylation of compounds bearing a single nucleophilic site is routine, the selective alkylation of polyfunctional molecules with multiple competing nucleophilic positions of comparable reactivity is often very challenging. In this work, we report a generalizable solution for selective alkylation chemistry that combines the selectivity of enzyme catalysis with the reactivity of off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf alkylation reagents. We employ engineered transferases in a modular cyclic cascade and use functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes as challenging proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept substrates. This catalytic alkylation approach is mild, highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, proceeds on gram&#8208;scale, provides rapid access to important N&#8208;alkylated heterocyclic building blocks and enables challenging late&#8208;stage alkylations. This study demonstrates a generalizable strategy to streamline synthetic routes to many pharmaceutically important compounds by selective biocatalytic alkylation of polyfunctional molecules and ambident nucleophiles.

         <title>Tertiary Phosphine Diversification via Photochemical P&#9472;C Chemoselective Cleavage of Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a pentacoordinated&#8208;phosphorane EDA complex system to achieve chemoselective P&#9472;C cleavage. Through iterative implementation, this protocol realized consecutive aryl substitutions, yielding tri&#8208;diverse&#8208;aryl phosphines with customizable architectures. The metal&#8208;free and one&#8208;pot strategy demonstrated wide applications in gram&#8208;scale synthesis, post&#8208;modification of commercial ligands, and construction of P&#8208;stereogenic centers.








Abstract
Differentially substituted phosphines are indispensable in medicines, materials, and catalysis, yet their customizable synthesis, traditionally depending on unstable P&#9472;H/halogen reagents, remains formidably challenging. Here, we report a photoredox strategy enabling controllable aryl substitution through chemoselective P&#9472;C cleavage. By engineering electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between phosphonium salts and tertiary amines, this metal&#8208;free protocol realizes three consecutive hydrocarbyl exchanges for delivering tri&#8208;diverse&#8208;aryl phosphines with transition metal contamination elimination and broad functional group tolerance including unprotected amines and hydroxyls, facilitating late&#8208;stage modification of drugs/commercial ligands and construction of P,O,S&#8208;tridentate architectures and chiral P&#8208;stereogenic centers. Mechanistic studies reveal the dynamic pentacoordinated&#8208;phosphorane&#8208;complex formation nature and the radical&#8208;intermediate pathway, while the chemoselectivity originates from different P&#9472;C bond strengths. This work establishes a modular and sustainable platform for programming&#8208;level precision phosphine engineering.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sila&#8208;Cycloaddition of Dichlorodisilanes: Selective Si&#9472;Cl Activation for Cyclic Disilanes and Enantioenriched Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes enables efficient access to diverse cyclic disilanes via selective Si&#9472;Cl activation. The method tolerates broad diene scope, offers an enantioselective variant, and reveals a unique Ni&#8304;&#8208;mediated SN2&#8208;type activation pathway.








Abstract
Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. This transformation proceeds under mild, reductive nickel catalysis via an unusual Si&#9472;Cl bond activation pathway and accommodates a broad range of dienes, including bulk feedstocks, cyclic, multi&#8208;substituted, aliphatic, aromatic dienes, and trienes. An asymmetric variant further enables the efficient construction of chiral disilane frameworks with high enantioselectivity. The resulting disilacarbocycle adopts boat&#8208;like conformations, as revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis, due to the elongated Si&#9472;Si and Si&#9472;C bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that a triplet Ni0 species engages in an SN2&#8208;type oxidative addition to the Si&#9472;Cl bond, favoring this pathway over a concerted Si&#9472;Si activation. The resulting Si&#9472;Ni(I) intermediates are energetically preferred over Si&#9472;Ni(II) analogs in the subsequent diene insertion step.

         <title>Prolonging Exciton Diffusion Length via Modulating Aggregation Structures for Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Certified Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exciton diffusion length (LD) and fluid mechanics were effectively optimized by modulating the polymer aggregation structure. The printing PPHJ flexible OPVs exhibits more than 18% efficiency, and the flexible device maintained 90.4% of the initial PCE after 2000 bending cycles, showing excellent mechanical stability. Meanwhile, the rigid device exhibits 20% efficiency (certified19.68%, the highest value for the eco&#8208;friendly solvent system). Notably, the fabricated 23.60&#160;cm2 large&#8208;area module was 15.60% PCE.








Abstract
The performance of flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaics (OPVs) constrained by low short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), resulting in diminished power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compromised mechanical stability. Enhancing the exciton diffusion length (LD) is pivotal for improving device parameters, including PCE. However, the underlying mechanisms governing exciton diffusion dynamics, influenced by the aggregation structure of conjugated polymers, remain insufficiently understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interchain free energy distribution [&#916;G(r)] and strategically modulates the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor PM6 by controlling its molecular weight (MW). Medium&#8208;MW PM6 demonstrates optimized aggregation behavior, leading to extended LD and precisely tuned fluid mechanics, which facilitate the formation of a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. These advancements enable PPHJ&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer flexible devices to achieve a PCE of 18.01%, with notable improvements in JSC and FF, and retain 90.4% of their initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. Encouraged by these advantages, a record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.0% (certified 19.68%) was achieved for eco&#8208;friendly, printed OPVs (PM6//L8&#8208;BO) with small&#8208;area devices (0.0621&#160;cm2), whereas large&#8208;area modules (23.60&#160;cm2) reached an efficiency of 15.60%.

         <title>Isotope Engineering of Tetraphenylethylene: Aggregate&#8208;Dependent Enhancement of Luminescence Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends the fluorescence lifetimes of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances intermode coupling and internal conversion.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE&#8208;5d, TPE&#8208;10d, and TPE&#8208;20d), combined with steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter&#8208;mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE&#8208;20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure&#8211;property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Ferroelectric Induced Multifield Coupling Effect Accelerates Charge Spatial Separation for Boosting Tandem Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupled with ferroelectric polarization in plasmonic&#8208;ferroelectric WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 heterojunction accelerates spatial separation and directional extraction of charge carriers, thereby ultimately boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction integrated with benzylicalcohol C&#9472;C coupling.








Abstract
Integrating solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic&#8208;ferroelectric heterojunction (WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO3&#8208;x and ferroelectric polarization in K4Nb6O17, thereby not only promoting energetic hot&#8208;carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot&#8208;electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K4Nb6O17 surface for CO2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO3&#8208;x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is 9.87 and 6.27&#8208;folds higher than that of K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C&#9472;C coupling for directed production of more value&#8208;added hydrobenzoin (313.15&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multifield coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.

&lt;p&gt;The synergistic effect of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupled with ferroelectric polarization in plasmonic-ferroelectric WO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction accelerates spatial separation and directional extraction of charge carriers, thereby ultimately boosting photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction integrated with benzylicalcohol C&#9472;C coupling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating solar-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic-ferroelectric heterojunction (WO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; and ferroelectric polarization in K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby not only promoting energetic hot-carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot-electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; surface for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits superior CO yield (294.76&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is 9.87 and 6.27-folds higher than that of K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; and WO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

         <title>Donor Engineering for High Performance n&#8208;Type OECT Materials with Exceptional Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor engineering with 2,3&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)fumaronitrile (DTFMCN) enables high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) polymers (S/B&#8208;DTFMCN). These materials achieve ultra&#8208;low threshold voltages and long&#8208;term operational stability, alongside efficient ion&#8208;electron transport. The study confirms that tailored donor design optimizes electrochemical stability and device longevity, demonstrating donor engineering as a key strategy for robust n&#8208;type OECTs with balanced performance and durability.








Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (PMIECs) have been widely used in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their structural diversity and the tunability of their frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels. However, the slower development of n&#8208;type materials compared to p&#8208;type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene&#8208;based donor building block, 2,3&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)fumaronitrile (DTFMCN), for D&#8211;A conjugated n&#8208;type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. DTFMCN can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one&#8208;step process. The DTFMCN&#8208;based D&#8211;A conjugated polymers, S&#8208;DTFMCN and B&#8208;DTFMCN, exhibit extremely low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n&#8208;type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra&#8208;low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high &#181;C* values of 13.49 and 13.57&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n&#8208;type OECT devices reported to date. This study highlights the effectiveness of DTFMCN in improving the operational stability of n&#8208;type OECT devices, offering promising potential for applications in bioelectronics.

         <title>When Bigger is Better: Lanthanum Complexes of Bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) FAlen Ligands as Unique Catalysts for the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Racemic &#946;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete lanthanum complexes supported by new bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) ligands act as highly efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) catalysts of simple and functional &#946;&#8208;propiolactones rac&#8208;BLR under mild conditions, returning in a controlled manner the corresponding linear polymers PBLR with high isoselectivity, no matter the nature and polarity of the solvent used.








Abstract
Discrete yttrium and lanthanum complexes supported by new bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) ligands have been prepared in high yields. Some of these so&#8208;called FAlen ligands, when coordinated onto the large La3+ in contrast to the small Y3+, can adopt an &#951;3 coordination mode of both amidine moieties. These La&#8208;FAlen complexes, either previously isolated or conveniently prepared in situ, act as highly efficient ROP catalysts of simple and functional &#946;&#8208;propiolactones rac&#8208;BLR (R&#160;=&#160;Me, CH2OiPr, CH2OSitBuMe2) under mild conditions, returning the corresponding linear polymers PBLR with high control over the molecular weights and narrow dispersities. More uniquely, when substituents with appropriate bulkiness are installed on the phenoxy and amidine moieties, the polymers all feature high isotacticity (Pm up to 0.93). High activity and isoselectivity are maintained, no matter the nature and polarity of the solvent used.

         <title>Backbone Protecting Groups for Enhanced Peptide and Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive account of the use of backbone N&#8208;protecting groups in peptide synthesis. It includes detailed synthetic methods relating to their introduction and removal and their application to &#8220;difficult&#8221; peptides and proteins of biological significance in both academic and industry contexts.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis has become an indispensable technique for the routine preparation of linear peptides of up to approximately 40 amino acids in length. However, the solid&#8208;phase approach is still hampered by chain insolubility and aggregation, which reduces synthetic yields. Moreover, many of the deletion impurities that can form are often chromatographically inseparable from the target sequence, which diminishes final product purity. The use of backbone N&#8208;protecting groups can ameliorate this synthetic inefficiency by increasing peptide chain solubility and suppressing aggregation. Backbone protection is also useful for promoting peptide macrocyclization, suppressing common side reactions in peptide chemistry, and improving solution&#8208;phase handling. Commercially available precursors containing benzyl&#8208;based groups and pseudoprolines have found widespread use, in academic laboratories and industry. A range of other strategies have also been investigated in a bid to increase the utility of backbone protecting groups and to develop more efficient methods for their introduction and removal. This review provides a comprehensive account of the state of the art, and includes detailed synthetic methods relating to the use of backbone protection, and its application to &#8220;difficult&#8221; peptides and proteins of biological significance. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are analyzed, and a commentary on future directions is provided.

         <title>Controlling Asymmetry Amplification Through Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Herein, using two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept chiral (S)&#8208;1 and (R)&#8208;1 Pt(II) complexes along with a model achiral compound 2, we demonstrate the ability of supramolecular polymorphism to control and amplify asymmetry. By strategically merging the distinct properties of polymorphs of (S)&#8208;1 and 2, we achieved a remarkable synergistic communication between chirality and luminescence in their coassemblies, paving the way for adaptive supramolecular materials with emergent functionalities. 








Abstract
Supramolecular polymorphism has recently emerged as a powerful concept, enabling a single chemical entity to form distinct, stable assemblies in solution with diverse morphological, photophysical, and electronic properties. Despite this progress, the interplay between supramolecular polymorphism and chirality remains unexplored. Herein, we harness supramolecular polymorphism to control the amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymerization (SP). For this purpose, we designed two Pt(II) complexes bearing &#960;&#8208;extended ligands and S&#8208; or R&#8208;chiral side chains (compounds (S)&#8208;1 and (R)&#8208;1) that self&#8208;assemble into two distinct supramolecular polymorphs in methylcyclohexane: nonemissive short fibers with parallel molecular packing (AggI) and thermodynamically more stable helical fibers with a rotationally offset stacking, closer Pt&#8943;Pt contacts, and weak 3MMLCT luminescence (AggII). These polymorphs exhibit markedly different amplification of asymmetry in majority rules (MR) and sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers (SaS) studies, with the thermodynamic polymorph displaying superior performance. Ultimately, coassembly studies between the achiral model compound 2&#8212;which exhibits strong 3MMLCT emission in the assembled state&#8212;and the chiral but weakly emissive AggII reveal a synergistic communication between chirality and luminescence, culminating in the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study broadens the scope of supramolecular polymorphism and expands the design toolbox for adaptive supramolecular materials with emergent and synergistic functionalities.

         <title>Doping Bulky Fluorinated Organic Anion to Construct Highly Efficient Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Type Photosensitizers for Cancer Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to enhance the fluorescence intensity and to modulate cellular uptake of anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIE PSs by doping bulky fluorinated anions tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (FTB) into nanoparticles was proposed. The optimized DF&#8208;FTB8 (FTB:DPBCF&#8208;Br&#160;=&#160;8:1) exhibited superior cellular uptake, outstanding imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation level, enabling efficient cancer photodynamic therapy. 








Abstract
Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature have demonstrated promising potential in photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer. However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the &#960;+ core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF&#8208;Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 to obtain NPs (named DF&#8208;TBX or DF&#8208;FTBX, X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF&#8208;Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X&#160;=&#160;8 in DF&#8208;TB8 and DF&#8208;FTB8, resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF&#8208;FTB8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers.

         <title>Dinuclear Au(0) Complex Supported by Tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
A complex featuring an Au(0)&#8211;Au(0) &#963;&#8208;bond is stabilized by tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P ligands, with the &#963;&#8208;bond serving as a two&#8208;electron donor to the Mg centers and enabling two&#8208;electron reductions of various substrates. This work highlights the significance of ligand design for stabilizing low&#8208;valent Au center and provides new cases to explore the properties of dinuclear Au(0) complexes.








Abstract
Despite significant advances in gold chemistry, the synthesis and stabilization of gold centers in a low oxidation state, particularly dinuclear Au(0) species, remain a considerable challenge. In this work, we report the successful isolation of a novel dinuclear Au(0) complex stabilized by tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P ligands. Computational studies demonstrate that the Au(0)&#8211;Au(0) &#963;&#8208;bond acts as a two&#8208;electron donor to the Mg centers. Reactivity studies further revealed the complex's unprecedented ability to perform two&#8208;electron reductions on a range of substrates, akin to the behavior of well&#8208;established Mg(I) and Zn(I) dimers.

         <title>Macromolecule&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Polymerization Induced by Crowding Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study is presented that investigates the influence of the excluded volume effect by macromolecules on supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. Upon crowding, the discotic supramolecular monomers sequentially assemble into polymers and higher&#8208;order aggregates (HOAs), affected by the macromolecule's concentration, size and polarity. The proven tunability and general applicability of this entropically driven assembly open new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.








Abstract
Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in biological systems by regulating dynamic processes, yet its effects in fully synthetic environments remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically investigate how excluded volume effects influence supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. We employ various discotic supramolecular monomers that assemble sequentially into polymers and kinetically&#8208;controlled higher&#8208;order aggregates (HOAs) only in the presence of macromolecular crowders. The phase diagram of the supramolecular assemblies reveals a strong dependence on the macromolecule concentration, size, and polarity, which can be tuned to control polymerization. Remarkably, at high crowder concentrations, large condensed and aligned assemblies were observed in dried samples, suggesting a transition to phase&#8208;separated states. By testing different monomers, macromolecules, and solvents, we establish the general applicability and versatility of macromolecular crowding in guiding supramolecular polymerization. This work provides fundamental insights into assembly processes in crowded environments and opens new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.

         <title>Exploring Mesoionic Imine&#8208;Carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) Adducts: 1,3 H&#8208;Shift, N(I) Compounds and Guanidinate&#8208;Type Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the unique reactivity of a mesoionic imine with bis&#8208;aryl carbodiimides, forming an MII&#8208;CDI adduct at room temperature via a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;H shift. These MII&#8208;CDI adducts serve as important synthons for mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene&#8208;stabilized nitreones (I) and guanidinate&#8208;type ligands.








Abstract
In this study, we report our recent findings on the synthesis and reactivity of a novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine&#8208;type mesoionic imine&#8208;carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) adduct. Unlike reported NHC&#8208;CDI adducts, formed by the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with CDI, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift (1,3&#8208;H shift), resulting in guanidine&#8208;type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3&#8208;H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The MII&#8208;CDI adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene (MIC&#8208;ADC)&#8208;based nitreone (N(I)) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behavior of these nitreone (N(I)) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these MII&#8208;CDI adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of MII in contrast to their N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (NHI) congeners.

Unlike reported &lt;b&gt;NHC-CDI&lt;/b&gt; adducts, formed by the reactions of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (&lt;b&gt;NHC&lt;/b&gt;) with &lt;b&gt;CDI&lt;/b&gt;, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3-hydrogen shift (1,3-H shift), resulting in guanidine-type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3-H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The &lt;b&gt;MII-CDI&lt;/b&gt; adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene-acyclic diamino carbene (MIC-ADC)-based nitreone (&lt;b&gt;N(I)&lt;/b&gt;) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behavior of these nitreone (&lt;b&gt;N(I)&lt;/b&gt;) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these &lt;b&gt;MII-CDI&lt;/b&gt; adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of &lt;b&gt;MII&lt;/b&gt; in contrast to their &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic imine (&lt;b&gt;NHI&lt;/b&gt;) congeners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Access to (3,11)&#8208;Cyclotaxanes&#8212;Synthesis of 1&#8208;Hydroxytaxuspine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Belonging to the family of complex taxanes, 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C is a densely functionalized natural product. The synthesis was realized via a semisynthetic approach, starting from commercially available 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III. A late&#8208;stage photocyclization was utilized to install the characteristic transannular bond of complex taxanes, transforming the classical framework into the intricate cyclotaxane skeleton on gram&#8208;scale.








Abstract
Herein, we present the semisynthesis of complex taxane diterpenoid 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C. Starting from cheap and abundant 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III, a scalable and robust route was developed, enabling an unprecedented gram&#8208;scale access to the intricate (3,11)&#8208;cyclotaxane scaffold. In addition, this represents the first synthetic access to C1&#8208;hydroxylated cyclotaxanes. The natural product is synthesized in 17 steps, with the reactions being performed on decagram&#8208;scale up to an advanced intermediate, establishing the scalability of this approach.

         <title>Anionic Coordination&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic coordination strategy has been developed to construct a halogen&#8208;coordinated Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) for the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is found that iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d orbitals and iodide p orbitals, facilitating electron transfer from the Ni center to the adsorbed CO2 (TEOA&#160;=&#160;triethanolamine).








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a promising strategy for producing high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels. However, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction remains a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate the stabilization of intermediates by constructing halogen&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) (Ni8L12X4, X = Cl, Br, I). Theoretical calculations show that the formation of *COOH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d and iodide p orbitals, enhancing electron transfer from the Ni center to adsorbed CO2 and promoting the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni8L12I4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl&#8208; and Br&#8208;coordinated Ni MOC by 200&#8208; and 5&#8208;fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Plasmonic Hot Spot Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is used to investigate in situ turnover frequency of photon emission on a series of shell&#8208;isolated plasmonic nanoamplifier (AuNR@mSiO2). Turnover frequency heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images present the distinct distribution of plasmonic hot spots along a single nanoamplifier. This platform provides an intuitive insight and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects, offering a sight to construct efficient nanoarchitectures of plasmonic electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), an important optical property of noble metal nanomaterials, is extensively applied in electrochemistry. However, the specific LSPR effects on metallic nanoparticles are difficult to unravel and evaluate, owing to simultaneous factors like intrinsic electroactivity and surface interactions. Herein, we designed a series of shell&#8208;isolated nanostructures, with mesoporous silica shells and plasmonic Au Nanorod cores (AuNR@mSiO2), for precisely investigating both LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging was employed to monitor the in situ turnover frequency (TOF) of photon emissions on individual plasmonic nanoamplifiers to determine the dominant factors influencing LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. TOF heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images unveiled distinct hot spot distributions along the plasmonic nanostructures. Our approach provides insight into and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects during electrochemical reactions, thereby facilitating precise electrocatalyst design based on the physiochemical properties of LSPR.

         <title>Low Molecular Weight Multistate Photoswitches Based on Simple Norbornadiene&#8208;Triazine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our new polyswitchable norbornadiene&#8208;triazine hybrids are promising candidates for molecular based data storage. These small, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecules can be both symmetric or contain different NBD chromophors and exhibit an unprecedently high variety of distinct switching states. By incorporating acid/base&#8208;responsive moieties, the number of achievable states can be doubled.








Abstract
We have synthesized and characterized a series of simple norbornadiene(NBD)&#8208;triazine architectures, including multistate photoswitches with unprecedentedly high information storage densities. The simple mono&#8208;NBDs served as suitable model systems to investigate the underlying absorption and switching characteristics. To increase the complexity stepwise, a bis&#8208;NBD derivative with a symmetric substitution pattern was investigated next. By combining different NBD substituents with varying electron demands, two asymmetric compounds, one bis&#8208;NBD and one tris&#8208;NBD, were prepared and investigated. In the case of the tris&#8208;NBD, the selective switching of the individual NBD chromophores is hampered by the too closely related optical properties of all three NBD units. On the other hand, the asymmetric photoswitch system containing two NBD&#8208;substituents fulfilled the requirements of a selectively addressable multistate system with an extremely high information storage density. Nearly all possible NBD/quadricyclane (QC) combinations could be realized here, including their reversible interconversion and the respective protonated forms. Quantum chemical calculations corroborated our experimental findings.

         <title>Intermolecular Sp3C&#9472;H Metalation of Non&#8208;Nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted Bases Using Simple Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M&#9552;Al or Ga, X&#9552;Cl, Br or I) effect the sp3C&#9472;H metalation of a number of hindered bases, including the ubiquitous non&#8208;nucleophilic 2,6&#8208;ditertbutyl substituted pyridine/pyrimidines. Mechanistic studies indicate a frustrated Lewis pair mechanism requiring singly halide&#8208;bridged super&#8208;electrophilic M2X6 dimers for sufficiently low C&#9472;H metalation barriers.








Abstract
2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted pyridines (tBu2&#8208;py) are widely used non&#8208;nucleophilic Br&#248;nsted bases. Their ubiquity is due to their highly hindered basic site and chemically robust nature. Herein we report that simple M2X6 Lewis acids (M&#9552;Al or Ga, X&#9552;Cl, Br or I) effect intermolecular sp3C&#9472;H metalation of tBu2&#8208;py bases under mild conditions.

         <title>Microscale Tattooing of Hydrogels and Cells: Benzoxaborole&#8208;Driven Microcontact Printing (&#181;CP) on Glycosylated Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a polymer brush&#8208;assisted microcontact printing (&#181;CP) to pattern glycosylated surfaces. We used a benzoboraxole derivative as an ink for surface patterning. With this novel method, we could functionalize wafer surfaces possessing glycopolymer films, surface&#8208;glycosylated polymer microparticles as well as cellular interfaces.








Abstract
Microcontact printing (&#181;CP) is a widely used technique for microscale surface patterning. In this study, we present a polymer&#8208;supported &#181;CP method for the patterning of (bioactive) glycosylated surfaces under hydrated conditions. Patterning is achieved by direct contact with a grooved polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp, whose surface was grafted with a dopamine&#8208;containing polymer. The polymer brushes offer an anchor for the boronic acid derivative 6&#8208;aminobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ol (ABOB), used as an ink for surface functionalization, to introduce patterns to three different surfaces as substrates: (1) monosaccharide&#8208;modified hydrogel surfaces possessing aldose (glucose, fucose, galactose) or ketose (fructose, sorbose) functions; (2) glycosylated surfaces of polymeric microspheres; and (3) the membranes of mammalian cells, such as human primary gastric cells and others. During &#181;CP, ABOB patterns transferred to the target surface through the formation of carbohydrate&#8208;ABOB complexes at fully hydrated, neutral pH conditions. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the successful transfer of ABOB patterns to glycosylated surfaces, with clear &#8220;tattoo&#8208;like&#8221; signatures observed on hydrogels, glycosylated particle surfaces and cellular interfaces.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of (&#8722;)&#8208;Sodagnitin E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malabaricane triterpenoid sodagnitin E is a chromogen found in various toadstools. This work represents the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;sodagnitin E as well as the first total synthesis of any malabaricane natural product. A Mukaiyama aldol reaction was utilized to perform a convergent synthesis from two enantioselectively synthesized fragments. Additionally, a structural revision of the relative configuration of sodagnitin E is proposed.








Abstract
We report the total synthesis of malabaricane triterpene sodagnitin E, marking the first synthesis of any malabaricane natural product to date. The enantioselective synthesis of two key fragments, followed by their coupling via a Mukaiyama aldol reaction delivered the triterpene framework in a convergent synthesis. A thorough analysis of the synthetic material led to the elucidation of a previously unassigned stereocenter (C17) as well as the reassignment of the configuration at C27. This enabled the structural revision of the relative configuration at the central lactol moiety.

         <title>Bicyclic Selenenyl Sulfides with Tuned Bioreductive Step Rates Reveal Constraints for Probes Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol reductants activate dichalcogenide probes by a cascade of partly reversible steps. Careful dichalcogenide engineering can tune the rates of these steps separately, to aim at probes that are kinetically selective for specific oxidoreductases in live cells. Here, we deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of bicyclic selenenyl sulfides, giving probes that selectively target the selenoenzyme TrxR1.








Abstract
The reductive activation of dichalcogenide probes by thiol&#8208;type oxidoreductases proceeds through a cascade of consecutive, partly reversible steps. Stereocontrol elements can modulate the reaction rates of these steps to reach substrate&#8208;controlled kinetic selectivity for reductase chemotypes in live cells. We now deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of unprecedented bicyclic selenenyl sulfides (SeSP), arriving at probes that selectively target the mammalian selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase TrxR1. We accessed these densely functionalised cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;thiaselenanes on gram scale over 5 steps by using a regioselective key step that elaborates an unusual, differentially protected 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;aziridine intermediate through sequential one&#8208;pot chalcogen introduction and selenenyl sulfide formation. By profiling a set of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomeric bicycles for their partly or fully reversible reactivity during reductive activation, we show how effects that slow their reduction steps (addition then resolution) can compensate by vastly accelerating subsequent activation (cyclisation) speeds, such that cellular processing is effective and TrxR&#8208;selective. More broadly, this study shows how multistep cascade probes can leverage conformational effects and internal noncovalent interactions to differentiate step kinetics along their on&#8208;target versus off&#8208;target reaction pathways, thus achieving reaction&#8208;based target selectivity in complex biological settings.

         <title>Mechanically Tunable Slide&#8208;Ring Polymers via Photo&#8208;Regulated Topological Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed light&#8208;responsive slide&#8208;ring polymer networks whose mechanical properties can be tuned through photoisomerization of the incorporated azobenzene units. The trans&#8208;state permits unhindered macrocycle sliding, yielding ductile materials, while UV&#8208;induced cis&#8208;configuration restricts macrocycle mobility to double Young's modulus. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions.








Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic dynamic control of polymer topology to modulate material properties on demand remains a grand challenge in polymer science. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive slide&#8208;ring polymer network whose mechanical properties can be tuned through photoisomerization of incorporated azobenzene units. In the trans&#8208;state, azobenzene enables unhindered sliding of macrocycles along the polymer backbone, yielding a softer, more ductile material.

     alt="Mechanically Tunable Slide-Ring Polymers via Photo-Regulated Topological Control"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed light-responsive slide-ring polymer networks whose mechanical properties can be tuned through photoisomerization of the incorporated azobenzene units. The &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-state permits unhindered macrocycle sliding, yielding ductile materials, while UV-induced &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-configuration restricts macrocycle mobility to double Young's modulus. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-synthetic dynamic control of polymer topology to modulate material properties on demand remains a grand challenge in polymer science. Here, we demonstrate a light-responsive slide-ring polymer network whose mechanical properties can be tuned through photoisomerization of incorporated azobenzene units. In the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-state, azobenzene enables unhindered sliding of macrocycles along the polymer backbone, yielding a softer, more ductile material. UV-induced switching to the sterically demanding &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-configuration restricts ring mobility, thereby increasing the Young's modulus by two-fold while reducing toughness. Control experiments with noninterlocked analogs revealed the opposite mechanical response&#8212;light-induced softening&#8212;highlighting the pivotal role of topology in property regulation. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions. This work establishes a versatile strategy for post-synthetic topological control via molecular photoswitches, enabling the design of adaptive polymers with stimuli-responsive mechanical properties for applications in smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into the Carbon Monoxide Reduction Reaction on Cu(111) from Operando Electrochemical X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a modified dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) approach is presented and used to probe the alkaline CO reduction reaction (CORR) over a Cu(111) surface. The results provide insight into the methane and acetate formation mechanisms and demonstrate a successful application of the method to the study of the CO(2)RR under operando conditions.








Abstract
In this work, we introduce a modified dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ECXPS) approach that offers new mechanistic insight into the alkaline carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) over a Cu(111) single crystal surface. We tackle two major unresolved questions in the CORR mechanism that persist in the literature. Firstly, we address the mechanism for methane formation on Cu(111) and show that the mechanism likely proceeds via atomic carbon, which subsequently couples, leading to the accumulation of amorphous carbon on the surface. Secondly, we provide insight into whether the mechanism for acetate formation occurs entirely on the surface or partially within the solution phase, showing that acetate is present on the surface, indicating a surface&#8208;based reaction. These insights into surface&#8208;based mechanisms provide a handle for designing future catalysts that can efficiently target the binding of specific intermediates. Furthermore, we expect that our modified approach to dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull ECXPS &#8211; in which we have changed the electrode geometry, the method of introducing the reactant gas and used hard x&#8208;rays &#8211; will significantly expand the technique's applicability, enabling studies of the CO(2)RR and beyond.

         <title>An Immobilized Rh&#8208;Based Solid Molecular Catalyst for the Reductive Hydroformylation of 1&#8208;Octene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the center a greenish droplet made of marble can be seen from which a chemical structure emerges, exemplifying the presented heterogenized, but molecular catalyst system for the reductive hydroformylation. The catalyst design was inspired by a homogeneous Rh&#8208;predecessor, which can be seen in the back in a characteristic dark green. Surrounding the droplet of the best&#8208;performing catalyst are masonry tools and broken drops featuring previous, less effective catalyst design iterations. Details of this research are reported by Andreas J. Vorholt et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202424144).

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR Reveals Reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cell Wall Due to a Host&#8208;Defence Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the mode of action is critical to develop new antifungal drugs. Solid&#8208;state NMR was used to study the reorganization of the Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall by a host&#8208;defence peptide. We identified specific polysaccharides and amino acids that are affected by the peptide. Our studies also suggest a mechanism on how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane, which may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.








Abstract
The limited availability of antifungal drug treatments and the rising issue of drug resistance highlight the urgent need for new antifungal drugs to combat drug&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The host&#8208;defence peptide cathelicidin&#8208;2 has demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on azole&#8208;resistant Aspergillus fumigatus but its mechanism of action remains elusive. We applied a tailored set 1H and 13C detected solid state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to elucidate the cell wall composition of Aspergillus fumigatus and to shed light on the mechanism of action of the peptide within the cell wall. Our results revealed that presence of the peptide affects galactosaminogalactan, an important component involved in the pathogenesis of invasive aspergillosis, as well as other specific polysaccharides and amino acids within the mobile cell wall domain. At longer exposure times, the peptide also influences the rigid cell wall domains by enhancing water penetration into the hydrophobic rigid cell wall domain. The findings reveal how the peptide can reach the plasma membrane and may aid the design of novel antifungal drugs with enhanced efficacy.

         <title>A &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; Fluorescent Probe for Multi&#8208;ROS Imaging Unveils Ferroptosis&#8208;Driven Liver Fibrosis Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the molecular network linking ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, a novel &#8220;cocktail&#8221; fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, was designed to monitor dynamic changes in three ROS species in activated HSCs and liver fibrosis mouse models. By application of the probe, the NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;HSCs activation signaling pathway and the pro&#8208;fibrotic role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis were successfully elucidated.








Abstract
Liver fibrosis is a pathological repair response to chronic liver injury and may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma if untreated. Currently, no approved therapies specifically target advanced liver fibrosis, thus exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis has become crucial. Previous studies have highlighted significant controversy regarding the role of ferroptosis in liver fibrosis. Given that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as key mediators to both processes, ROS may serve as a molecular nexus connecting ferroptosis and liver fibrosis. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular network involving ROS and ferroptosis in liver fibrosis, we designed and synthesized the first multi&#8208;functional &#8220;cocktail&#8221; fluorescence probe, FP&#8208;ROS, enabling highly sensitive and selective simultaneous imaging of O2&#8226;&#8722;, H2O2, and ONOO&#8722;. FP&#8208;ROS was successfully employed to assess ferroptosis levels in the livers of fibrosis mice following drug intervention. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we elucidated the signaling pathway NOX&#8594;ONOO&#8722;&#8594;GCLM(C46)&#8594;GSH&#8594;ferroptosis&#8594;hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a critical role in HSCs activation and further elucidates the molecular interplay between ROS and ferroptosis in fibrosis progression. These findings provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis.

This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a critical role in HSCs activation and further elucidates the molecular interplay between ROS and ferroptosis in fibrosis progression. These findings provide novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Neural Stem Cells with Micropatches for Improved Therapy of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing techniques and are adhered to the membrane of neural stem cells through tuning material&#8211;cell interaction. The micropatches on the membrane can move together with implanted neural stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid to promote the neuronal differentiation of stem cells and thus improve their therapeutic performance in repairing traumatic brain injury.








Abstract
Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) holds promise for repairing traumatic brain injury (TBI) but their therapeutic performance is hindered due to the low efficient differentiation into neurons. Direct injection of differentiation modulators to the lesion site has limited improvement to neuronal differentiation as they tend to diffuse or be degraded. In the present study, we report a simple and versatile strategy to engineer the NSCs with a micropatch to improve their therapeutic performance in TBI treatment. The micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing technique and can adhere to the membrane with negligible detachment or internalization within 14 days after surface modification. The micropatches on the cell membrane can move together with stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid, a neuronal differentiation modulator, to regulate the surrounding microenvironment of NSCs, improving their neuronal differentiation rate from 28.0% to 54.2%. The micropatch&#8208;engineered NSCs can be implanted into the injured brain tissue through a minimally invasive microinjection approach and show outperformance in repairing damaged neural tissue of TBI mice compared to normal stem cells. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway to engineer stem cells and holds great potential in nerve regeneration and neurodegenerative disease treatment.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Regulation of Perovskite Growth and Energetics via Oligoether Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembling Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligoether chain was incorporated to construct self&#8208;assembling molecules, which can not only enable good coverage and optimized buried interface properties but also assist high&#8208;quality and ordered perovskite growth as well as regulate top energetics of perovskite. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% was realized in perovskite solar cells along with enhanced long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling molecules (SAMs) are widely used as interfacial layers to optimize the surface properties of nickel oxides (NiOx) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, less attention is paid to the effect of SAMs on the regulation of perovskite growth and energetics. Here, based on the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular backbone, an oligoether chain is introduced with different chain lengths to endow two novel SAMs, namely, EPA and MEPA, with good capability of bottom&#8208;up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiOx with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain&#8208;containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization, and importantly well&#8208;matched energy level alignment at the top surface, especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiOx/MEPA&#8208;based PSCs along with good device stability, which can maintain 90% of the initial efficiency under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions over 1260&#160;h.

         <title>Mathematical Double&#8208;Matrix Switchable Homochiral Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the first homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics showing on/off switchable second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response. They exhibit strong SHG&#8208;CD with the anisotropy factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) up to 1.28 and a 432F2 ferroelectric phase transition, enabling the unprecedented on/off switching of both SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric active and SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric inactive states.








Abstract
Homochiral ferroelectrics have attracted increasing attention in recent years because of their distinctive chiroptical effects in contrast to ordinary ferroelectrics. Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between nonzero and zero values in both second&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibility &#967;(2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we reported homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 (BTA&#160;=&#160;3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium), which exhibits a 432F2 ferroelectric phase transition at 362&#160;K, accompanied by the switchable matrix elements between nonzero (for point group 2) and zero (for point group 432) values in both &#967;(2) and d matrices. They show strong SHG&#8208;CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432F2 phase transition enables (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase. Our findings shed light on the exploration of mathematical double&#8208;matrix switchable chiral ferroelectrics with SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response switching.

         <title>Enhanced Active Hydrogen Absorption and Stabilized Cu(I) Species Over Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ce Bridges Boosting Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8211;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4.








Abstract
Rational design of water activation center to promote active hydrogen (*H) generation and stabilize Cu(I) species are significant for the formation of multicarbon (C2+) products over Cu&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, CeO2 nanograins and CuO nanothorns were selectively deposited on the edges of Cu2O cubes through the seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8211;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8211;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4. This work provides new insights into modulating *H absorption and stabilizing Cu(I) species for boosting CO2 to C2+ products.

         <title>Deconstructive Radical&#8211;Radical Coupling for Programmable Remote Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified approach to access a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls through a radical&#8208;promoted deconstructive process utilizing dual photocatalysis/carbene catalysis is reported. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with a broad scope with robust functional group tolerance along with application in the preparation of &#947;&#8208;amino esters, three&#8208;component manifolds, and the first enantioselective deconstructive synthesis of 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls using a chiral NHC catalyst.








Abstract
Dicarbonyl compounds are structural motifs that have been extensively utilized in synthetic chemistry, and their downstream transformations have proven valuable in synthesizing numerous heterocycles. Conventional methods for accessing such compounds include the Stetter reaction, the Michael reaction, and Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation. However, a flexible and enabling platform for obtaining all types of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls remains undeveloped. Reported herein is a unified approach to access a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls through a radical&#8208;promoted deconstructive process utilizing dual photocatalysis/carbene catalysis. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with a broad scope with robust functional group tolerance along with application in the preparation of &#947;&#8208;amino esters, three&#8208;component manifolds, and the first enantioselective deconstructive synthesis of 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls using a chiral NHC catalyst.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Tetrabenzylphosphonium Groups as Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Artificial Anion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mitochondriotropic artificial anion channels have been constructed from a self&#8208;assembled tetrabenzylphosphonium framework with an inherent ability to autonomously target mitochondria. Anion transport is mediated by multiple intermolecular C&#9472;H&#8943;anion H&#9472;bonds and electrostatic ion pair interactions. The highly efficient transmembrane anion transport is demonstrated by low micromolar anticancer activity against three cancer cell lines.








Abstract
Artificial ion channels with specific organelle&#8208;targeting capabilities have been scarcely investigated. Here, we report the first&#8208;in&#8208;class mitochondria&#8208;targeting anion channels derived from a structurally simple tetrabenzylphosphonium framework, in stark contrast to its phenyl&#8208;based counterpart, which lacks anion transport activity. Structural and computational analyses underscore the critical role of the methylene (CH2) linkers in the benzyl groups. These CH2 units reduce positive charge delocalization to enhance &#963;&#8208;hole&#8211;anion interactions, while also enabling H&#8208;atoms from both the CH2 linkers and aromatic rings to cooperatively form multiple C&#9472;H&#8943;anion H&#9472;bonds. In further conjunction with the rigid benzene rings, they help create sufficient spatial voids to accommodate anion translocation, collectively facilitating and energizing the anion transport process. Among the series studied, those bearing methyl and tert&#8208;butyl substituents exhibit the highest transport activity via a channel mechanism, with a conductance value as high as 26.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8&#160;pS. Furthermore, leveraging the cationic nature of the quaternary phosphonium center, this family of anion channels readily achieves targeted mitochondrial localization, demonstrating potent anticancer activity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.42 to 3.04&#160;&#181;M across three cancer cell lines.

         <title>Superprotonic Conduction Over Wide Humidity Range Driven by Enhanced Proton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although numerous studies on covalent organic framework &#8208;based proton&#8208;conducting membranes have been documented, the majority concentrate on synthesis, with mechanistic investigations remaining relatively sparse. In addition, the mechanistic studies can be categorized into two primary areas. The first area is dedicated to the study of proton diffusion, including the analysis of hydrogen bonding patterns and the mobility of guest molecules. The second area delves into strategies to enhance the proton&#8208;dissociation capability of acidic groups, such as discussing the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups or zwitterionic species. In this work, we meticulously study the role of proton intermediates in proton conduction and have successfully achieved superprotonic conductivity by reducing the proton dissociation energy of these intermediates.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;conducting materials play a key role in various fields, and their proton conduction is profoundly restricted by the proton dissociation process. This process has two components: dissociation from acidic groups (e.g., &#8722;SO3H) and dissociation from intermediate species (e.g., H3O+, C&#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H+). Extensive research has concentrated on the former, utilizing acidic groups with minimal proton dissociation energy or low pKa values, while the latter's substantial effects have been largely overlooked. In reality, proton&#8208;accepting atoms within intermediates, such as oxygen and nitrogen, typically produce a higher electron cloud density compared to those in acidic groups. This results in a pronounced electrostatic binding effect on mobile protons, as well as high dissociation energies. Thus, diminishing the dissociation energy associated with intermediates is paramount in the development of high&#8208;performance proton conductors. Herein, we construct one covalent organic framework&#8208;based proton conductor, achieving superprotonic conduction over a wide humidity range by decreasing the dissociation energy of protons from intermediates. The success of this approach can be attributed to two key factors: the crowded guest molecules within the framework that mitigate proton hydration, and the concurrent establishment of C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H+ interactions. These combined effects significantly reduce the electrostatic attraction exerted on mobile protons, thereby enhancing proton conduction.

         <title>Anion Vacancies Triggered Spin Polarization Enables Efficient Piezocatalysis for Water Cleanup</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion vacancies triggered spin polarization enables efficient piezocatalysis for water cleanup is described by Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu and Huan He et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202507265). The cover image illustrates an anion vacancy&#8208;triggered spin polarization strategy to efficiently convert organic pollutant into carbon monoxide (CO) with fast kinetics. The unpaired spin electrons of Fe and Mo atoms can effectively interact with the carbon reduction intermediates, not only promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH, but also provides spin electrons to enhance *COOH adsorption and reduces activation barriers.

Side&#8208;on coordinated molecular hypofluorites FM(&#951;2&#8208;OF) (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated alkaline earth metal atoms with diluted OF2 in cryogenic matrices. The structures parallel the non&#8208;VESPR structures of alkaline earth metal difluorides and dihydrides, such that FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar, FCa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) is planar but with a shallow bending&#8208;potential curve, while FSr(&#951;2&#8208;OF) and FBa(&#951;2&#8208;OF) are non&#8208;planar. Bonding analyses show that the interactions between the metal center M2+ and the negatively charged ligands F&#8722; and OF&#8722; are mainly electrostatic. Moreover, for FMg(&#951;2&#8208;OF), donation of electron density from OF&#8722; to empty s and p orbitals of magnesium is involved. However, for the heavier alkaline earth metal compounds, the donation to empty d orbitals of the metal center becomes dominant in orbital interactions, which contributes to their non&#8208;planar structures.

         <title>Glycosylation&#8208;Dependent Stability of Human Pentraxin&#8208;2 Revealed by Surface&#8208;Induced Dissociation and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate glycosylation pattern of human Pentraxin&#8208;2 (PTX&#8208;2) poses a challenge in studying the structural impact of individual glycans. By combining surface&#8208;induced dissociation (SID) or unfolding (SIU) with ion mobility mass spectrometry, we successfully differentiated the stability of glycoengineered PTX&#8208;2 variants. Our approach specifically revealed how terminal sialylation influences both complex and subunit stability.








Abstract
Pentraxin&#8208;2 (PTX&#8208;2), also known as Serum Amyloid P component, functions as an immunoregulatory glycoprotein and plays a crucial role in fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Desialylation of PTX&#8208;2 has recently been associated with reduced bioactivity and diminished inhibition of fibrocyte differentiation in IPF patients. Each monomer in the naturally assembled pentameric complex is N&#8208;glycosylated, predominantly featuring terminal sialic acids on biantennary glycans. However, the influence of these glycoforms on PTX&#8208;2&#8242;s mechanism of action (MoA) and conformational properties has not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we demonstrate the combined application of surface&#8208;induced dissociation (SID) and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) to assess the impact of specific glyco&#8208;engineered PTX&#8208;2 variants on the stability of its pentameric and decameric complexes. We further explore the effect of individual monomer glycosylation on complex stability. Our results reveal that high levels of terminal sialylation significantly enhance complex stability, whereas desialylation and mannosylation reduce the stability of both pentameric and decameric PTX&#8208;2 forms. Regarding the stability of single PTX&#8208;2 monomers ejected from the pentamer, in contrast, we found that desialylated and highly mannosylated glycans contribute to the individual monomer stability.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Ni&#8208;MOF Reconstruction into Active Ni(OH)2 OER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), composed of one&#8208;dimensional Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains interconnected by 1,4&#8208;ndc linker, into catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. This top&#8208;down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4&#8208;ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional (thickness ~ 1.5&#8208;2.6 nm), defect&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm&#8208;2, surpassing commercial IrO2. In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni&#8211;O bond contraction from 2.06 &#197; to 1.89 &#197; under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbed oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Recyclable Hybrid Polymer Networks using Whole Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whole&#8208;plant biomass from non&#8208;agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole&#8208;cell spirulina, a green&#8208;blue algae, into robust hybrid algae&#8208;polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The hybrid algae&#8208;based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all&#8208;synthetic equivalents.&#160;These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled hybrid materials which is facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust hybrid materials, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Tough 3D Printable Elastomers with Human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;Loop Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance elastomers for additive manufacturing requires overcoming complex property trade&#8208;offs that challenge conventional material discovery pipelines. Here, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress&#8211;strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi&#8208;component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (&gt;10 MPa) and high strain at break (&gt;200%). Analysis of the high performing materials revealed structure&#8211;property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine&#8208;guided, human&#8208;augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi&#8208;objective materials optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Single&#8208;Atom Metal Oxide Catalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high&#8208;activity candidates. High&#8208;throughput screening of 261 transition metal single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped metal oxides (MSA&#8208;MOx) identified nine top&#8208;performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential &lt; 0.5 V), including MnSA&#8208;RuO2 and FeSA&#8208;TiO2 (theoretical overpotential &lt; 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant&#8208;potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of MnSA&#8208;RuO2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, machine learning prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single-atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high-activity candidates. High-throughput screening of 261 transition metal single-atom-doped metal oxides (MSA-MOx) identified nine top-performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential &amp;lt; 0.5 V), including MnSA-RuO2 and FeSA-TiO2 (theoretical overpotential &amp;lt; 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant-potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of MnSA-RuO2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, machine learning prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Photodegradable and Thermo&#8211;reversible, Soft, Transparent Dithioacetal Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8211;reversible, chemically cross&#8211;linked polymers capable of altering their physicochemical and mechanical properties on demand, upon application of external stimuli (e.g., light, temperature), are highly desirable for the development of multifunctional materials. Herein, we report a facile chemical platform for the synthesis of photodegradable and thermo&#8211;reversible, model hydrogels consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the elastic strands and dithioacetal moieties at the cross&#8211;link points. The gels were synthesized via an acid&#8211;catalyzed step&#8211;growth reaction of a difunctional PEG&#8211;thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross&#8208;linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross&#8722;links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation, endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV (&#955; = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm&#8211;1) and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating, were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by 1H NMR spectroscopy kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Tetrahedral and Cation Entropies for Long&#8208;lifespan Low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, their&#160;application&#160;is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low&#8208;temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with&#160;the desolvation&#160;kinetics&#160;of&#160;Zn2+. We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3&#8208;butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable&#160;glass&#8208;forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid&#8208;liquid transition temperature from &#8208;16.4 to &#8208;101 &#176;C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn&#178;&#8314;&#160;to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by&#8208;reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long&#8208;term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at &#8208;40 &#176;C&#160;under 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8208;2,&#160;and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (&#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C). This work offers a guideline to design stable&#160;and low&#8208;temperature AZIBs, expanding the application scope&#160;for aqueous electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Reinforce Buried Interface Anchoring for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been commonly used as a single&#8208;component hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but suffer from facile &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and self&#8208;aggregations in solution and consequently poor anchoring ability with the atop perovskite layer. Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn&#8208;SAM) strategy through blending a non&#8208;planar molecule 3,3&#8208;(4&#8208;amino&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me&#8208;4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi&#8208;device compatibility. The single&#8208;junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn&#8208;SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm2) for 1.56 eV and 1.68 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively. Moreover, this approach is beneficial for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on fully textured surfaces of heterojunction (HJT) silicon bottom cells, affording PCEs of 31.56% (area: 1.07 cm2) and 26.57% (area: 20.06 cm2). All devices exhibit excellent long&#8208;term storage and thermal stability even under non&#8208;encapsulated conditions</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Parallel Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;ligand Charge Transfer Dynamics in [Ru(L)2(dppz)]2+ Molecular Lightswitch with N K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light&#8208;driven charge separation in the well&#8208;studied &#8220;molecular lightswitch&#8221; [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (aqueous [RutheniumII(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine)]2+[Cl&#8208;]2) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real&#8208;time using ultrafast x&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. &#160;Sub&#8208;70 fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra&#8208;ligand electron transfer following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;dppz metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2 ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time&#8208;resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter&#8208;ligand electron &#8220;hopping&#8221; between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well&#8208;studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light&#8208;driven electron transfer chemistry.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter- and intra-ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light-driven charge separation in the well-studied &#8220;molecular lightswitch&#8221; [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (aqueous [RutheniumII(2,2&#8217;-bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2-a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-c]phenazine)]2+[Cl-]2) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real-time using ultrafast x-ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. &#160;Sub-70 fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra-ligand electron transfer following Ru-to-dppz metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2 ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time-resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter-ligand electron &#8220;hopping&#8221; between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru-to-bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well-studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light-driven electron transfer chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zwitterionic Electrolyte Additive for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Ammonium Alkyl Sulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte additive is an important component of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. At present, commercial film&#8208;forming additives can only work on either anode or cathode so as to increase the complexity and decrease the efficiency of the electrolyte. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (TEAPS) additive, which can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. The kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction of TEAPS promotes the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species Domaine interface, thereby enables greatly improved cycling performance. It is believed that the zwitterionic TEAPS will work as a novel versatile additive for high&#8208;performance LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp2)&#8211;H Bond Activation with a Heterometallic Nickel&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a ligand&#8208;catalysed bond breaking and making process that occurs with a Ni&#8211;&#8205;Al heterometallic complex. While combinations of Ni pre&#8208;catalysts and Al additives are known for site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalisation, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD)2] and [(BDI)AlH2] (1; BDI = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketiminate), results in facile formation of a Ni&#8211;&#8205;Al heterometallic complex [(&#951;4&#8209;COD)Ni{&#956;&#8209;H)2Al(BDI)}] (2; COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp2)&#8211;H activation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H2 evolution; a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy3. The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labelling studies, and modelling. The reaction is 1st order in PCy3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9&#8208;1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C&#8211;H oxidative addition and H2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible, and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps, may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Ni Single Atoms toward Efficient Urea Photosynthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct photochemical synthesis of urea under mild conditions presents considerable promise. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic urea synthesis is severely restricted by the co&#8208;adsorption and activation of inert CO2 and N2 molecules. Herein, an ingenious&#160;design of a high&#8208;performance Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst by strategically coupling Ni single atoms and oxygen vacancies (Ov) onto urchin&#8208;like TiO2 architecture. By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73 &#181;mol/gcat./h. Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N2 adsorption and activation, generating *N2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N2 to form a &#8220;tower&#8208;like&#8221; urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual&#8208;active&#8208;site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high&#8208;value products.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral amines are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic catalysts. Their increasing demand has driven the advancement of synthetic methods. In this study, we developed a metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method for the synthesis of chiral amines. Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent C=N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent cellular functions. This reactivity highlights the potential to develop new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic functions capable of addressing challenges in both organic synthesis and biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

Herein, we develop boron&#8208;doped amorphous Bi metallene arrays for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH electroreduction. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B&#8208;induced p&#8208;sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH&#8322;OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at &#8722;0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts. This work not only proposes a novel catalyst design leveraging amorphous engineering and orbital hybridization but also demonstrates the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis in steering reaction pathways for electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrochemical Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring stable and functional linkages through  facile   one&#8208;pot   cyclocondensation reactions represents one of the frontiers in the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which can enhance structural robustness and diversity while broadening their application potential. In this study, we report a facile synthetic strategy using p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a proton mediator to construct two imidazole&#8208;linked COFs (TABQ&#8208;COF and TAPT&#8208;COF) via one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation of aromatic aldehydes with ortho&#8208;diamines. These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity, but also exhibit excellent physico&#8208;chemical stability and contain abundant redox&#8208;active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (&lt;0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox&#8208;active centers (C=O and C=N groups), which enable efficient Na+ storage through multi&#8208;electron redox mechanisms. This study highlights the strategic advantage of structurally stable COFs with precisely engineered redox&#8208;active motifs via facile synthesis for advancing high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Embracing Complexity: Peptides as Tuneable Scaffolds in the Construction of Discrete Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has advanced rapidly, with scientists using fundamental understanding to generate function from simple building blocks. However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function; introducing chiral, information&#8208;rich, building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures, to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures, and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding, to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures, and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Collision&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Oligosaccharides: Mechanistic Insights for Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Glycomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural alterations in oligosaccharide structure are often associated with disease, positioning clinical glycomics an emerging tool for diagnostics. This is most commonly achieved using a controlled collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) of larger oligosaccharides into fragments and measuring their mass in a mass spectrometer. Due to the complexity of oligosaccharides, and particularly their unusual fragmentation mechanisms, the underlying processes are poorly understood. Deciphering glycan fragmentation and making it understandable is highly desirable and would transform the field of glycomics from an expert technique into a widely applicable tool available to non&#8208;specialists. Here, we review the current knowledge of glycan fragmentation mechanisms in CID, with particular emphasis on hexose migrations and the anomeric memory. We discuss challenges and perspectives for future investigations, opening the window to widespread use of glycomics in clinical applications based on a fundamental understanding of glycan fragmentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Metallic Binding Characteristics of the Intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;Block Cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8211;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non&#8208;standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722; and the complex [La(C5Me4H)3] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)&#8211;Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron&#8208;rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe&#8208;Salpeter&#8208;equation (GW&#8208;BSE) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Structure&#8208;Selective On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Isokekulene versus Kekulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of different facets of metal nanoparticles in steering reaction pathways is crucial for the design of heterogeneous catalysts with superior selectivity. As a prominent class of reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8208;H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92 %, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (&gt; 99 %). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO&#8208;functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule&#8208;substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly&#8208;selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ammonia from nitrate-containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag-N/O bonds on one-dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h-1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &amp;gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag-N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioelectrosynthesis of Signaling Molecules for Selective Modulation of Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectrosynthesis holds great potential for studying and regulating biological systems through the in situ synthesis and delivery of cell signaling molecules with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite recent advancements, precise control over multiple signaling molecules within a single platform remains challenging. Here, we introduce a bioelectrosynthesis approach capable of selectively producing two types of signaling molecules from a single precursor. This system leverages multi&#8208;metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on&#8208;demand modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines. By combining electrochemical precision with selective cell control, this strategy may advance the study and regulation of biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters&#160;by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for&#160;enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge.&#160;In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy&#160;which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering.&#160;Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (~1 nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters,&#160;including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo, and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale&#160;IrCo alloy clusters&#160;(denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster)&#160;demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA/cm&#178; and a remarkable mass activity 87.5&#160;times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between&#160;Ir atoms and the support,&#160;which inhibits particle agglomeration. This&#160;work provides an&#160;effective strategy for&#160;preventing&#160;particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves&#160;precise size control&#160;at sub&#8208;nanoscale,&#160;opening&#160;a new avenue for the development&#160;of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;thiosumanene&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep&#8208;level defects (Pb2+, VI) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration&#8208;functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theorical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT&#160;enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep&#8208;level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT&#8208;modified n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol. This work offers a unique molecular designing mechanism to address the interfacial&#8208;related issues for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Overlooked Dual Phosphorescence of Lappert&#8217;s Diamino Stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first stable heavy carbene homologues, the heavy tetrylenes, were reported in 1973 by Lappert and co&#8208;workers. These tetrylenes were extensively investigated with respect to ground state reactivity such as small molecule activation, insertion into &#963;&#8208;bonds, coordination chemistry, materials chemistry or catalysis. Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that Lappert&#8217;s bright yellow coloured diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted structures. The present study provides new insights towards a rational design of tetrel(II) complexes with long&#8208;lived emissive excited states with Lappert&#8217;s diamino stannylene being the prototype.</dc:description>

         <title>Conduction Band Convergence and Modular Nanostructures: Driving High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;type PbSe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;type lead chalcogenides showing high thermoelectric performance are rare due to the larger energy offset between the two lowest energy conduction bands minima, leaving ample opportunity to modulate electronic structure for improving their thermoelectric performance. Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of ~1.8 at 873 K in n&#8208;type PbSe doped with MoCl5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4d orbital hybridized with the Se 4p&#8208;Pb 6p. This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n&#8208;type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (&#963;S2) of ~21 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 873 K for PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl5. When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano&#8208;heterostructures (5&#8208;30 nm) of PbSe&#8208;MoSe2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano&#8208;heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;&#8343;&#8336;&#8348;) of 0.20 W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;1 at ~725 K in PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl5 sample.</dc:description>

Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing 3d&#8208;4d Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion offers a promising way to address the energy and environmental issues, however, the development of self&#8208;supporting catalyst with high activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self&#8208;supporting carbon cloth with N&#8208;doped carbon arrays (PdCo&#8208;NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3d&#8208;4d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz2&#8208;5&#963; and dyz&#8208;2&#960;* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self&#8208;supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO2 methanation while serves as a photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat converter to improve the temperature of reaction system. As a result, PdCo&#8208;NC/CC exhibits unprecedent photothermal performance toward CO2 methanation, delivering a CH4 generation rate as high as 15.23 mol gmetal&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source. Moreover, the continuous flow photothermal reaction can be smoothly proceeded over 100 h, demonstrating the high stability of PdCo&#8208;NC/CC in CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Assisted Confined Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Metal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of enzymatic and metal catalysis in cascade reactions offers a highly efficient approach for producing high&#8208;value chemicals, such as chiral pharmaceuticals. However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme&#8208;assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme&#8208;metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions.&#160;The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co&#8208;encapsulation and dual&#8208;optimization of both components.&#160;Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2&#8208;fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1&#8208;phenylethylamine (1&#8208;PEA), and a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in racemization&#160;conversion,&#160;compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers&#160;~91% yield, &gt;98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal&#8208;enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme&#8208;metal cascade systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Phase Formation of Sodium Layered Cathodes Materials with Prominent Electrochemical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical performances of layered cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of phase structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. In this study, a series of P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of structural insights into P'2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn&#8208;valence changes during synthesis process, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P'2&#8208;P2 phase transition. Moreover, these structural insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the obtained P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ~40 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ~93 mAh g&#8208;1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%. This research significantly advances the comprehension of both synthesis mechanism and electrochemical properties optimization mechanisms of P'2 phase materials, offering a pragmatic strategy for elevating the performance of SIB materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of CDK12/13 and BRD4 Molecular Glue Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic approach for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;related proteins. While molecular glue degraders exhibit drug&#8208;like properties, their discovery has traditionally been serendipitous and often requires post&#8208;hoc rationalization. In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism&#8208;guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage&#8208;binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead to a bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Structural Oscillation Mediates Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic dissolution of active species of electrocatalysts suffers severe durability issues thus limiting practical sustainable electrochemical application despite the enormous strides in the activity. An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni&#8208;O2&#8208;Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy with S, Co co&#8208;doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillation. In&#8208;situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution while the electron&#8208;withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co&#8208;O2&#8208;Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800 h (5000&#8208;h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05 kWh Nm&#8208;3 H2 @ 4000 A m&#8208;2. The levelized cost of hydrogen of US$2.315/KgH2 overmatches the European Commission's target for the coming decade (&lt;US$ 2.5/kgH2).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of CF2X groups beyond CF3 into arene scaffolds is underdeveloped despite these groups&#8217; utility as halogen&#8208;bond donors and as precursors to bioisosteres. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and comparative photochemistry of a suite of [Ag(II)(bpy)2O2CCF2X]+ and Ag(II)(bpy)(O2CCF2X)2 (bpy = 2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, X = F, CF3, Cl, Br, H, CH3) carboxylate complexes. We find a dramatic effect of the X substituent on the efficiency of generating CF2X radicals by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), with Ag(II) photoreduction rates varying by over an order of magnitude and quantum yields spanning over 20%. We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)&#8211;O2CCF2X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)&#8208;mediated electrophotocatalytic CF2X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes. This work expands the nascent field of Ag(II)&#8208;based photocatalysis by allowing for (hetero)aryl&#8211;CF2X functionalization directly from unactivated fluoroalkyl carboxylate precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain&#8208;release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise, but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (SmI2) catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>PCR&#8208;Free Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis on Repetitive Sequences Using Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Assisted Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Nicking by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (SDM) is a key driver for many biochemical investigations and biotechnological applications. Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR&#8208;free SDM method that uses DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double&#8208;stranded DNA, we employed single&#8208;stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double&#8208;stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target&#8208;specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR&#8208;incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost&#8208;effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Protected Organozirconium Catalyzes C&#8211;H Alumination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface grafted organozirconium&#8208;catalyzes C&#8211;H/Et&#8211;Al exchange reactions, involving saturated hydrocarbons and AlEt3, to afford organoaluminum compounds and ethane. The Zr(OtBu)3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;700 (1) catalyst contains monopodal &#8801;SiO&#8211;Zr(OtBu)3 and only a few residual silanols (&lt;5%). Nonetheless, these silanols are the Achille&#8217;s heel of 1, providing a pathway for surface and catalyst degradation during catalysis, limiting the alkylaluminum yield and catalyst turnover. Support degradation, involving the cleavage of Si&#8211;O bonds by activated surface organometallics, is inhibited by capping silanols with &#8211;SiMe3. Residual silanols in 1 react with allyltrimethylsilane, as determined by solid&#8208;state 13C and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and reaction stoichiometry, to form Zr(OtBu)3/SiMe3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;700 (2), which is resistant to degradation by AlEt3. CH alumination of dodecane catalyzed by 2 produces higher yields of the 1&#8208;dodecylaluminum product in comparison to 1, and in &gt;95% selectivity. Additionally, methane undergoes 2&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H alumination, providing a route to AlMe3.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type Photophysics of Rotational Isomers in a Diphenylanthracene Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecular dimers serve as valuable model systems for manipulating and exploring interchromophore interactions. However, the structural flexibility introduced by linker or chromophore rotation gives rise to conformational isomers with distinct atomic arrangements, complicating the interpretation of photophysical processes. In this study, we investigate 9,9,10,10&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bianthracene (TPBA) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA. To address the &#8216;Janus&#8208;type&#8217; photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment&#8208;dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in&#8208;depth study of the Janus&#8208;like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclodextrin&#8208;based slide&#8208;ring gels (SRG) have emerged as a promising class of materials owing to their unique topology. Upon mechanical loading, the slidable cross&#8208;links of the polymer network freely translocate along the polymer backbone enabling pronounced energy dissipation in the material, which is associated with exceptional ductility and toughness. Despite the critical role of sliding dynamics in defining SRG mechanical properties, attempts to control them have primarily been limited to tuning the overall loading of macrocycles. Further, SRGs that can be triggered via an external stimulus have yet to be reported. In this work, we present light&#8208;responsive SRGs based on azobenzene&#8208;containing polymers. Reversible photoswitching of the azobenzenes modulates the sliding dynamics of the threaded a&#8209;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) macrocycles. By using UV&#8211;Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that &#945;&#8209;CDs readily bind to the azobenzenes along the polymer backbone in the E configuration. Upon light irradiation, and thus isomerization to the Z isomer, the macrocycles no longer interact with the azobenzenes, allowing them to freely translocate along the polymer backbone. As a result of this E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization and difference in sliding dynamics, the mechanical properties of the SRGs reversibly alternate between a stiff and a soft state.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing New Natural&#8208;Mimetic Phosphatidic Acid: a Versatile and Innovative Synthetic Strategy for Glycerophospholipid Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) play important roles in cellular compartmentalization and signaling. Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL&#8208;mediated signaling pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Multisite Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Facilitates Oxidative Photocatalysis in a Molecular Zr&#8208;Based Coordination Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of mediators that harness visible light to drive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) offers a promising pathway to achieving challenging redox transformations in a more sustainable manner and with enhanced thermochemical efficiency. However, designing photocatalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant metals while gaining precise control over their excited&#8208;state reactivity remains a significant challenge. Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr3(O)(OH)3 nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O&#8211;H and C&#8211;H bonds (70&#8211;100 kcal&#183;mol&#8722;1). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground&#8208;state, pre&#8208;association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedent ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies Based on Electronic Interactions for Effective Catalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of effective bidirectional electrocatalyst focused on electronic interactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Development of effective bidirectional catalyst is essential for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The catalytic activity of catalyst is directly related to the degree of the interaction between the catalysts and adsorbates. In the review, we introduce the design strategy for catalysts with high catalytic activity focused on the electronic structure and properties of catalysts and reactants.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density (&gt;500&#160;W h kg&#8722;1). However, LSBs exhibit an unsatisfactory energy density (&lt;400&#160;W h kg&#8722;1) and cycle life (&lt;300 cycles) because of the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates and the sluggish conversion reaction kinetics caused by insulating sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Although various types of catalysts, including metal&#8208;based compounds to single&#8208;atom catalysts, have been reported to address these issues, most catalysts exhibited limited catalytic activity under practical lean electrolyte conditions (&lt;5&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). A comprehensive understanding of the synthetic strategy and catalytic mechanism of catalysts is essential for their design, but understanding the electronic effects of the catalysts and LiPS is more important. Furthermore, the electronic design of these catalysts is not well understood. In this review, we introduce the catalytic mechanisms in LSBs and discuss catalyst design strategies in terms of electronic effects on the interactions between reactants and catalysts, with a primary focus on heterogeneous catalytic systems. We additionally consider how the electronic property of homogeneous systems, particularly redox mediators, affects catalytic behavior under lean electrolyte conditions and propose future research directions for catalyst development in LSBs.

         <title>Electronic Structure Origins of Distinct Hydrogenation Activities Observed for Linear and Bent Bimetallic &#956;&#8208;Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first research that employs a combination of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations to clearly elucidate the contribution of electronic structure to the distinct hydrogenation reactivity of bent and linear bimetallic nitrides. 








Abstract
Hydrogenation of metal nitrides is of particular interest due to the direct relevance to Haber&#8211;Bosch ammonia synthesis. Notably, for all bi&#8208; and multi&#8208;nuclear bridging nitrides reported thus far, only those featuring bent M&#9472;N&#9472;M cores can react with dihydrogen (H2) and related H2&#8208;derived species, while the vast majority of linear M&#9472;N&#9472;M congeners cannot. Herein, we present a detailed electronic&#8208;structure study of prototypical bimetallic bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides [Cp*FeIV(&#956;&#8208;SEt)2(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIVCp*][PF6] (1, Cp*&#160;=&#160;&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) and [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;N)CoIIICp*] (3, Ad&#160;=&#160;adamantyl) and linear &#956;&#8208;nitride [(TPP)FeIV(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIV(TPP)][PF6] (2, TPP2&#8722;&#160;=&#160;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato), as well as &#956;&#8208;imide [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;NH)CoIIICp*][BPh4] (4), using various spectroscopic techniques, in particular, 15N solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, coupled with density functional theory calculations. An in&#8208;depth analysis of their distinct 15N shielding tensors revealed that bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides invariably possess a high&#8208;lying proton&#8208;accepting molecular orbital (MO) and a low&#8208;lying electron&#8208;accepting MO. These electronic&#8208;structure features are key to the bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides affecting hydrogenolysis via either two&#8208;electron oxidation of H2 or H2 heterolysis. However, because of symmetry, linear &#956;&#8208;nitrides lack potent proton&#8208;accepting MOs, which rationalizes their disparate hydrogenation activities.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific On&#8208;Site Activation of Cisplatin via Cascade Catalytic&#8208;Redox Reactions for Highly Efficient Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of cisplatin (cDDP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cDDP in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis for highly efficient chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficiency of platinum drugs is always limited by low utilization, side effects, and Pt&#8208;resistance. Herein, a double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine named PtNP@Cu has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of dechlorinated cisplatin (DP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cisplatin (cDDP) in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis of cancer cells. This design avoids the premature release of active PtII species in normal cells or in the cytoplasm of cancer cells before reaching nucleus, thereby ensuring maximum amplification of Pt&#8208;DNA crosslinking with tumor&#8208;specificity. Meanwhile, substantial GSH depletion and ROS production induced by cascade catalytic&#8208;redox reactions results in ferroptosis of cancer cells, which further reduces GSH&#8208;mediated cDDP detoxification, overcomes Pt&#8208;resistance, and enhances immunogenicity, ultimately realizing highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy and antitumor immunity in vivo. This work provides a new strategy for effectively and comprehensively addressing the issues of low utilization, side effects, and drug resistance problems of platinum drugs, which is also promising for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Unexpected Redox Role of WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 Catalysts for Selective Reduction of NO by Forming V&#8211;W Dinuclear Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the NH3&#8208;SCR reaction over V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalyst, WO3 not only serves as an acidic promoter and structural regulator, but also plays a redox role. The WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5.








Abstract
Promoters can greatly improve the activity of catalysts; however, the mechanism by which they interact with the primary catalyst to enhance catalytic activity is not always clear. It has been widely demonstrated that WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts acts as a promoter to enhance the surface acidity and regulate the dispersion of active V2O5 species, while it is believed that the redox process takes place entirely at the V sites in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR). Here, by combining in situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we validate that the WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect in NH3&#8208;SCR by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5. This study sheds new light on a long&#8208;standing puzzle regarding the role of WO3 as a promoter and hence advances the understanding of the working principle of V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts.

         <title>Unveiling Zinc Stripping and Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the zinc stripping process is more prone to cause severe side reactions than the deposition process, resulting in the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; In this regard, a dynamic molecular protection strategy is proposed to regulate the zinc stripping and deposition processes simultaneously, achieving long&#8208;lasting protection of the zinc anodes.








Abstract
The unstable zinc anode is a key challenge limiting the cycle life of rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The current research primarily focuses on the zinc plating process, with strategies to induce uniform zinc deposition for a stable zinc anode. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc stripping process has a more significant impact on the subsequent zinc deposition, which exacerbates the formation of by&#8208;products, dendrites, and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; Therefore, we propose using aspartyl&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester (APM) molecules to regulate the zinc stripping, achieving uniform stripping of the zinc anode by increasing the stripping overpotential across high&#8208;energy barriers. Simultaneously, its localized hydrophobic functional groups effectively inhibit the byproducts triggered by solvated water molecules. The experimental results show that the Zn&#8208;APM symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, with stable cycling over 6500&#160;h (&gt;9 months) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 700&#160;h at 70% zinc utilization with 10&#160;&#181;m zinc. In addition, the Zn&#8208;APM||Zn0.58V2O5&#183;H2O full cell exhibits 80% capacity retention after 500 cycles at a loading of 8.1&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;It is found that the zinc stripping process is more prone to cause severe side reactions than the deposition process, resulting in the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; In this regard, a dynamic molecular protection strategy is proposed to regulate the zinc stripping and deposition processes simultaneously, achieving long-lasting protection of the zinc anodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unstable zinc anode is a key challenge limiting the cycle life of rechargeable zinc-ion batteries. The current research primarily focuses on the zinc plating process, with strategies to induce uniform zinc deposition for a stable zinc anode. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc stripping process has a more significant impact on the subsequent zinc deposition, which exacerbates the formation of by-products, dendrites, and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; Therefore, we propose using aspartyl-phenylalanine methyl ester (APM) molecules to regulate the zinc stripping, achieving uniform stripping of the zinc anode by increasing the stripping overpotential across high-energy barriers. Simultaneously, its localized hydrophobic functional groups effectively inhibit the byproducts triggered by solvated water molecules. The experimental results show that the Zn-APM symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, with stable cycling over 6500&#160;h (&amp;gt;9 months) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 700&#160;h at 70% zinc utilization with 10&#160;&#181;m zinc. In addition, the Zn-APM||Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cell exhibits 80% capacity retention after 500 cycles at a loading of 8.1&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comparative Study of Solvatomorphs of Stryker's Reagent Using MicroED and Quantum Mechanics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new solvate form of Stryker's reagent was crystallized from benzene which has regular octahedra with equivalent Cu&#8211;Cu interatomic distances. Quantum crystallography approach HAR led to reliable position of hydrides in both the forms. The reported THF solvate form has edge bridging hydrides while the newly discovered form may have both edge and face bridging hydrides supported by structural and topological analysis. 








Abstract
The atomic position of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides has been a long&#8208;standing structural question in inorganic chemistry given that hydride delivery is integral to diverse chemical reactions. Microcrystal electron diffraction (microED), with it's increased sensitivity toward hydrogen atoms relative to X&#8208;ray diffraction, offers a potential path to addressing this challenge. Herein, the first microED study of Stryker's reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate. Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge&#8208; and face&#8208;bridging hydrides.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered CRISPR/Cas12a for Genomic Editing and Tumor Regression</title>

         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for gene editing is introduced. The machinery is applied for endogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) gene editing and for in vitro disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene. The machinery is used for in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors, resulting in effective apoptosis and necrosis of the tumor tissues.








Abstract
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for in vitro and in vivo gene editing is introduced. The system consists of a caged, inactive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl phosphate ester photo&#8208;responsive crRNA, which, upon light&#8208;induced deprotection, yields the active CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing machinery (LAC12aGE). The LAC12aGE system induces specific thymidine&#8208;rich (TTTN) protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;guided double&#8208;stranded breaks in genomic DNA, which upon non&#8208;homologous end&#8208;joining lead to gene repair. The LAC12aGE machinery is applied for gene editing of an exogenous dual fluorescent reporter gene in living cells, as well as the endogenous gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 1. In addition, the LAC12aGE is applied for in vitro gene editing and disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene in HepG2 cells, where knockout of the HGF gene results in inhibited cell proliferation and migration, as well as enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, the in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors by the LAC12aGE machinery is demonstrated. The cyclic temporal development of the LAC12aGE system in tumors shows effective inhibition of tumor growth and enhanced apoptosis/necrosis of tumor tissues compared to control systems.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective and Low&#8208;Carbon Scalable Recycling of Waste Polyethylene Terephthalate Through Bio&#8208;Based Guaiacol&#8208;Enhanced Methanolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective and low&#8208;carbon PET recycling strategy is developed using bio&#8208;based guaiacol to promote methanolysis through an intermediate stabilizing mechanism. Under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), the system achieves complete PET conversion within 2 h, producing dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG) at yields of 94% and 98%, respectively.








Abstract
The global plastic waste crisis, particularly from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), demands sustainable recycling solutions. PET methanolysis offers a promising route to recover high&#8208;purity dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), but achieving scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly processes under mild conditions remains challenging. This study introduces a bio&#8208;based catalytic system using guaiacol and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), achieving 94% DMT and 98% ethylene glycol (EG) yields within 2 h. Unlike conventional acid&#8208;catalyzed or co&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted methanolysis methods, the phenolic hydroxyl group of guaiacol critically stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency. The system demonstrates broad versatility across various polyesters and real&#8208;world PET waste streams, including mixed textiles and colored plastics, while enabling selective depolymerization. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm its low carbon footprint, energy efficiency, and industrial viability. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy offers a sustainable solution for PET recycling, addressing both environmental and economic challenges while advancing resource circularity in the plastic industry.

         <title>Polyphosphorus Ligand Complexes of Coinage Metals for Multiple Capturing of Intact P4 Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>

Self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 and C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) with coinage metal salts and white phosphorus afforded an unprecedented novel class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes in which metal ions multiply coordinate intact P4 tetrahedra. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the right choice of the solvent tune the structure and the content of P4 in the coordination products that can release P4 upon decomplexation.








Abstract
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 (Cp*, 1a), C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) (CpPEt, 1b)) with the coinage metal salts [Cu(CH3CN)4][SbF6] or AgSbF6 were investigated to study the prerequisites for the potential coordination of white phosphorus by using a sterically encumbered CpR ligand and noncoordinating anions. In the self&#8208;assembly reactions with white phosphorus, either 0D or 1D coordination complexes are formed, all of which feature coordinated intact P4 tetrahedra and thus comprise an unprecedented class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes capable of complete release of P4 in solution confirmed by NMR studies. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the correctly chosen solvent allowed for obtaining more beneficial structural motifs, the first discrete tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinated cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand complexes, that provide the maximal content of coordinated P4 molecules per species known so far. All products are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.

&lt;p&gt;Two- and three-component self-assembly reactions of [Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (Cp*, &lt;b&gt;1a&lt;/b&gt;), C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(4-EtC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) (Cp&lt;sup&gt;PEt&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1b&lt;/b&gt;)) with the coinage metal salts [Cu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] or AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; were investigated to study the prerequisites for the potential coordination of white phosphorus by using a sterically encumbered Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; ligand and noncoordinating anions. In the self-assembly reactions with white phosphorus, either 0D or 1D coordination complexes are formed, all of which feature coordinated intact P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra and thus comprise an unprecedented class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes capable of complete release of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in solution confirmed by NMR studies. The bulkiness of the used Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; ligand and the correctly chosen solvent allowed for obtaining more beneficial structural motifs, the first discrete tetra- and penta-coordinated &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand complexes, that provide the maximal content of coordinated P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules per species known so far. All products are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Local Proton Concentration and *OOH Intermediate Generation for Efficient Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis was achieved on F&#8208;CNTs with Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% at 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. F&#8208;doping regulated the electronic structure, enhanced nanoconfinement effect and oxygen mass transfer of CNTs, leading to a local alkaline microenvironment and promoted *OOH generation for acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction is a sustainable method for on&#8208;site H2O2 synthesis. The H2O2 in acidic media has wide downstream applications, but acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from poor efficiency due to high proton concentration and unfavourable *OOH (key intermediate) generation. Herein, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis was enhanced by regulating local proton availability and *OOH generation via fluorine&#8208;doped on inner and outer walls of carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs). It was efficient and stable for H2O2 electrosynthesis with Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% and H2O2 yield of 606.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 at 1.0 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 0.05&#160;M H2SO4, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The F&#8208;doping regulated the electronic structure of CNTs with elevated p&#8208;band center, and F&#8208;doping on its inner and outer walls also enhanced nanoconfinement effect and superhydrophobicity, respectively. As a result, a local alkaline microenvironment was created on F&#8208;CNTs surface during acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. The energy barrier for *OOH generation was significantly reduced and oxygen mass transfer was boosted. Their synergistic effects promoted acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. This work provides new insights into the mechanism for regulating H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Chiral Spirobipyridine Synthesis by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition</title>

We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition between bisalkynyl malononitriles and terminal alkynes. Chiral spirobipyridines bearing ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituents can be synthesized with the help of chiral bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.








Abstract
Chiral spirobiindanes are recognized as the privileged structures in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the structurally similar chiral spirobipyridines have not yet been explored as chiral ligands or organocatalysts due to the absence of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of spirobipyridines via double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction. Spirobipyridines with ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents could be obtained with exclusive regioselectivity and up to 99% ee in the presence of cobalt and bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Spirobipyridines coordinate with transition metals as chiral ligands. Spirobipyridine dioxides can be applied as chiral organocatalysts in the asymmetric allylation of aldehydes.

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatially controlled occlusion of polymeric nanoparticles into cuprous oxide (Cu2O) systematically alters lattice distortion, oxygen vacancy content, and catalytic efficiency in the resulting composite crystals, offering a robust framework for the development of advanced functional composite materials.








Abstract
Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in a spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from the surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.

         <title>Visible Light Excited Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Tuning in Carbon Dots via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the discovery of confining carbon dots (CDs) into boric acid matrix realizing the precise regulation of color from red to white with delay time increase under white light (WL) excitation. And composites can emit persistent afterglow at high temperatures up to 393&#160;K under WL excitation. Its time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) and high stability lay a solid foundation for higher&#8208;order cryptographic and anticounterfeiting.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials that can be activated under visible light with strong stability remains challenging. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) were confined in the boric acid matrix to activate surface crosslinking emissive clusters and modulate charge transfer (CT) interaction, facilitating green and red dual emissive centers to coexist in composites. The presence of halogen atoms strengthened the interactions between CDs and boric acid. Notably, the CT interaction can offer excitons at low energy levels and allow for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, making the red emissive center more dominant under visible light excitation. The interplay of dual centers featuring sufficient color differentiation and different decay rates activated characteristic TDPC evolution resulting in dynamic afterglow evolution from red to white under visible light excitation. Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra&#8208;strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperatures of up to 393&#160;K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.

Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra-strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperatures of up to 393&#160;K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Divergent Hydroboration/Multiboration of Terminal Alkynes via Markovnikov Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free and Markovnikov&#8208;type process for divergent hydroboration/multiboration of terminal alkynes has been achieved, enabling the transformation of diverse aryl and alkyl alkynes into valuable but previously inaccessible &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronate, 2,2&#8208;diborylalkane, 1,2,2&#8208;triborylalkane, and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkane with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities by simply modulating the proton additive and solvent.








Abstract
Hydroboration/multiboration of alkynes has been considered a straightforward route for the construction of high&#8208;value alkenylboronates and multiborylalkanes, especially reflected by the productions of &#946;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes based on the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type transformations of terminal alkyne. However, the syntheses of branched &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes remain elusive due to the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable Markovnikov hydroboration process. Herein, we present a conceptually novel metal&#8208;free approach for Markovnikov hydroboration of terminal alkynes to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates. Derived from it, we have successfully realized unprecedented tailor&#8208;made multiborations (2,2&#8208;dihydroboration, 1,2,2&#8208;triboration, and 1,2&#8208;dihydroboration) of alkynes by simply changing the proton sources and solvents. The broad substrate scope and outstanding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of the developed approaches unlock opportunities to exploit these formerly unattainable organoboronates, thereby expanding uncharted chemical space. The preliminary mechanistic studies highlight the synergistic roles of amide solvents, suitable proton sources, and B2cat2 in facilitating these tunable transformations.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination in Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enables Fast Charge Dynamics and Hierarchical Active Sites for Two&#8208;Stage Kinetics in Photodegradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation demonstrates an efficient synthetic methodology for the fabrication of atomically dispersed cobalt species anchored on carbon nitride substrate, featuring distinctive asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination environments and hierarchical active sites. The unique electronic structure of this single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits strengthened driving force and boosted charge carrier transport properties, manifesting in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics during the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A contaminants in wastewater.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted growing interest in solar&#8208;driven catalysis, though challenges persist due to symmetrical metal coordination, which results in limited driving force and sluggish charge dynamics. Additionally, uneven energy and mass distribution complicate reaction pathways, ultimately restricting solar energy utilization and catalytic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized cobalt single atoms decorated carbon nitride catalysts featuring a highly asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination, tailored for photocatalytic organic pollutants removal. Advanced experimental studies and simulation results collectively revealed that the unique microenvironment surrounding Co single atoms improved charge dynamics and created reactive hot spots, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species during the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. These enhanced charge dynamics, combined with hierarchical active sites, resulted in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics and excellent stability for the degradation of bisphenol A in wastewater, distinctly outperforming the first&#8208;stage kinetics observed for polymeric carbon nitride. This work advances the understanding of structure&#8208;performance relationships in SAC&#8208;based photocatalytic degradation and offers valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation SACs in environmental catalysis.

         <title>Supramolecular TADF Materials from Calix[3]Acridan and Guest&#8208;Linked Polymers for Rapid and Visual Detection of Trace Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the rapid and visual detection of trace benzene was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A based on luminescence color change mechanism, and the limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1. Moreover, GP1@C[3]A was fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane.








Abstract
In this work, a new strategy for rapid and visual detection of trace benzene vapor was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) polymeric materials via luminescence change mechanism. Consequently, a new type of multi&#8208;color STADF polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A were constructed by host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[3]acridan (C[3]A) and different guest&#8208;linked polymers (GPs). Interestingly, by adjusting the added molar proportion of C[3]A, multi&#8208;color TADF property of GPs@C[3]A could also be easily tuned. Notably, when a 20% molar ratio of C[3]A was added, GP1@C[3]A exhibited white luminescence. Especially, by using the high selectivity of C[3]A toward benzene and its differential binding affinities for acceptor guests versus benzene, rapid detection of trace benzene vapor was achieved in few seconds with the naked eyes. The limit of detection concentrations for benzene reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1, indicating GPs@C[3]A could be used as an excellent sensor for rapid detection of benzene at trace level. Furthermore, GP1@C[3]A could also be fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane. This work offers an innovative idea for the application of STADF materials in detection, and also addresses the key challenge of simultaneously improving sensitivity, selectivity and visualization in benzene detection.

         <title>Theodor F&#246;rster: Life and FRET from 1933 to 1951. A Viewpoint from the Archives</title>

         <dc:description>
Theodor F&#246;rster's name is forever linked to FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) and while his development of FRET theory is well known and recognized, only few is documented about his scientific career and life from 1933 to 1951. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article discusses F&#246;rster's life and career before, during, and after National Socialism in Germany.








Abstract
FRET stands for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. While much is known about resonance energy transfer, much less is known about F&#246;rster&#8211;apart from the fact that he was the one who translated FRET from a theoretical phenomenon into a broadly usable method for investigating and understanding biomolecular interactions on the nanoscale. Arguably, a major reason for the limited recognition of Theodor F&#246;rster is his scientific career during the Nazi time in Germany about which little is documented. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article&#8211;on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death&#8211;sheds some light on F&#246;rster's life from 1933 to 1951 and describes how a young scientist struggled during dark times in history.

The phase separation of self&#8208;assembled hosts in a gel from liquid guests is a convenient approach for heterogeneous encapsulation. In their Communication (e202504207), Dong Yang and co&#8208;workers report a class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates, which can be utilized as filling material in columns and show the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization.

Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers relies on simple, easily accessible building blocks with minimal steric hindrance and strong electron deficiency. Xugang Guo and co&#8208;workers report a quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), in their Research Article (e202501196). The TTD&#8208;based polymers exhibit tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, along with outstanding n&#8208;type thermoelectric performance.

Like attracts like, they say; however, decades elapsed before mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes were finally self&#8208;assembled. In their Research Article (e202503614), Eugenia Peresypkina, Manfred Scheer et&#160;al. demonstrate that reactive white phosphorus molecules can be captured by a polynuclear silver complex based on pentaphosphaferrocene and controllably released in solution. The cover image plays around the concept of high loading of intact tetrahedral P4 molecules within the carrier complex.

Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of challenging cyclic tertiary amines is reported. In their Research Article (e202505275), Svetlana B. Tsogoeva and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt as an efficient organoautocatalyst, enabling double C(sp2)&#8208;N bond metathesis at room temperature via a domino reaction mechanism. This metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free transformation advances green, waste&#8208;reducing, and sustainable approaches in organic synthesis.

Aze&#8208;HMSiR, a near&#8208;infrared spontaneously blinking fluorophore, enables long&#8208;term SMLM imaging of lysosomes with minimal phototoxicity, as reported by Xiaogang Liu et al. in their Research Article (e202503177). Combining pH responsiveness and high photostability, it reveals critical lysosomal features&#8212;distribution, size, and lumen pH&#8212;under different anticancer treatments. This whole&#8208;cell imaging approach provides a powerful new tool for visualizing lysosomal dynamics and serves as a sensitive indicator for functional diagnostics in live&#8208;cell environments.

         <title>From Binary to Higher&#8208;Order Organic Cocrystals: Design Principles and Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From binary to higher&#8208;order organic cocrystals: strategic design principles, precision synthesis, and multifunctional applications. The emergence of ternary and higher&#8208;order cocrystalline systems, comprising three or more components, has revolutionized the paradigm of material design by significantly expanding both structural diversity and functional potential. These advanced architectures not only exhibit enhanced design versatility through synergistic molecular engineering but also enable unprecedented modulation of physicochemical properties, thereby introducing novel optoelectronic, mechanical, and stimuli&#8208;responsive functionalities.








Abstract
Organic cocrystals, particularly the evolution from binary to higher&#8208;order structures, have garnered considerable attention due to their tunable intermolecular interactions and unique material properties. Binary cocrystals, formed through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, charge transfer, and hydrogen/halogen bonding, allow for precise control over molecular packing and enhanced optoelectronic properties. In contrast, higher&#8208;order cocrystals, incorporating three or more components, enable greater complexity and functional diversity. Strategies such as homologation via isostructural substitution, hierarchical intermolecular interactions, and long&#8208;range Synthon Aufbau Modules facilitate the synthesis of these advanced materials. The shift toward higher&#8208;order cocrystals paves the way for novel applications in fields such as deep learning for cocrystal prediction, drug design, organic solar cells, and NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. However, challenges related to molecular screening, ratio optimization, scalable synthesis, and long&#8208;term stability remain critical hurdles for the broader implementation of these materials in practical applications.

         <title>Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic Crystals: Molecular Design and Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals have advanced through molecular design (donor&#8208;acceptor structures, &#960;&#8208;conjugation) and crystal engineering to overcome aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and energy gap limitations. Featuring high quantum yields, tunable deep&#8208;red/NIR emission, and flexibility, they enable applications in flexible waveguides, lasers, and bio&#8208;integrated optoelectronics.








Abstract
Red&#8208;emissive organic materials play a pivotal role in optoelectronics, including displays, optical communications, organic lasers, and biomedicine, owing to their high penetration and low scattering properties. However, conventional polymer and thin&#8208;film emitters often face efficiency losses at long wavelengths and limited operational stability. Organic molecular crystals have emerged as promising alternatives by offering high purity, low defect density, and unique optical anisotropy. Among them, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals (ROMCs) remain relatively underdeveloped compared to their blue and green counterparts. Moreover, the inherent brittleness of most crystals poses significant challenges for their integration into flexible and wearable devices. This review highlights recent advances in the design and development of ROMCs, emphasizing molecular and crystal engineering strategies to overcome photophysical limitations and impart mechanical flexibility. Emerging applications in organic lasers, optical waveguides, and bioimaging are discussed, alongside key challenges and future research directions. By bridging fundamental understanding and practical deployment, this perspective offers a comprehensive roadmap for the rational design of flexible, red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting crystalline materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic platforms.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Protein Degradation: An Emerging Therapeutics Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a powerful therapeutic approach, with numerous candidates molecules now advancing into clinical development. Recent innovations have incorporated nanoparticles to facilitate and enhance these degradation processes, yielding synergistic effects. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated targeted degradation, outlining recent advances, key challenges, and future opportunities to guide progress in this rapidly evolving field.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a transformative therapeutic strategy for eliminating disease&#8208;associated proteins, with relevance across disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Since its inception nearly two decades ago, TPD has attracted strong academic and commercial interest, with multiple candidates advancing into clinical trials. Despite this progress, the field faces persistent challenges, including limited solubility, poor cellular uptake, and unpredictable structure&#8211;activity relationship of small&#8208;molecule degraders, which complicate rational design. To address these limitations, alternative platforms such as nanoparticle&#8208;mediated protein degraders (NanoPDs) have gained attention. First reported 17 years ago, NanoPDs harness a diverse array of materials, degradation mechanisms, and linker chemistries to achieve protein clearance through novel pathways. Although promising, their clinical translation remains constrained by barriers such as lysosomal entrapment, protein corona formation, and biocompatibility concerns. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated TPD. We emphasize the design principles underlying nano&#8211;bio interfaces and explore the role of proximity&#8208;induced biology as a mechanism for orchestrating protein interactions. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and key questions that must be addressed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of NanoPDs.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Cation Effects in Electrolytes for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cations play a pivotal role in controlling electrocatalytic reaction pathways, selectivity, and kinetics. A deeper mechanistic understanding of cation effects offers opportunities to overcome the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalytic reactions, enabling the rational design of more efficient electrolyte systems.








Abstract
Traditional understanding of electrocatalytic reactions has primarily focused on the covalent interactions between adsorbates and catalyst surfaces, often overlooking the significant influence of the electrolyte on the catalytic process. Recently, researchers have highlighted the pivotal role of cations in the electrolyte, demonstrating their capability to modulate the reaction pathways and thus the activity and selectivity. These findings underscore the need for a deeper, atomic&#8208;level understanding of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This perspective presents the mechanisms through which cations affect electrocatalysis, with a focus on the hydrogen&#8208;bond network, the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, the electric field within the electrochemical double layer, and the local electronic properties of catalysts. It provides a summary of the influences of cations on various electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, future research directions are provided to maximize the potential of leveraging the cation effects in the design of more efficient electrolyte systems.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Review on Aerogels and Polymeric Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review goes to data&#8208;driven. An exhaustive literature survey provides an overview of research status on aerogels, a category of highly porous solids with unique physicochemical properties. Statistical/data&#8208;driven analysis tells us positive/negative aspects; aerogels have a promising potential to contribute to emerging energy/environmental issues, while they are causing an academic fever with irresponsible exaggerations and a flood of unreliable data.








Abstract
A thoroughly data&#8208;driven review on the chemistry, properties, and applications of aerogels is provided. Aerogel is a category of solid materials having homogeneous, highly porous nanostructures. Unique physicochemical properties of aerogels have attracted much attention in wide fields due to their potentials for energy/environmental issues in the 21st century, while an exponentially increasing number of papers are causing an academic fever and unreliable data issues. Statistical analysis based on an exhaustive literature survey from almost all the papers with &#8220;aerogel&#8221; in their titles reveals a flood of freeze&#8208;dried aerogels mainly consisting of organic polymers and organic&#8211;inorganic composites. Process&#8208;property data from polymer aerogel papers are analyzed by a machine&#8208;learning approach aiming to establish data infrastructure toward future aerogel studies. Data&#8208;evidenced critical discussion specifies a tendency in unreliable thermal conductivity data of these papers.

Statistical/data-driven analysis tells us positive/negative aspects; aerogels have a promising potential to contribute to emerging energy/environmental issues, while they are causing an academic fever with irresponsible exaggerations and a flood of unreliable data.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thoroughly data-driven review on the chemistry, properties, and applications of aerogels is provided. Aerogel is a category of solid materials having homogeneous, highly porous nanostructures. Unique physicochemical properties of aerogels have attracted much attention in wide fields due to their potentials for energy/environmental issues in the 21st century, while an exponentially increasing number of papers are causing an academic fever and unreliable data issues. Statistical analysis based on an exhaustive literature survey from almost all the papers with &#8220;aerogel&#8221; in their titles reveals a flood of freeze-dried aerogels mainly consisting of organic polymers and organic&#8211;inorganic composites. Process-property data from polymer aerogel papers are analyzed by a machine-learning approach aiming to establish data infrastructure toward future aerogel studies. Data-evidenced critical discussion specifies a tendency in unreliable thermal conductivity data of these papers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dopant and Exfoliation Induced Simultaneous Modification of Charge Density and C&#9472;C Coupling Sites for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into higher carbon products demands precise catalyst engineering. In this study, we implemented a dual doping strategy in AgBiP&#8322;S&#8326; to optimize charge density and enhance active sites for C&#9472;C coupling. This approach successfully enabled the synthesis of ethylene through the photoreduction of CO2, showcasing the effectiveness of the modified catalyst design.








Abstract
The photochemical conversion of CO2 into C2+ products has emerged as an attractive method for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuels using abundant solar energy. However, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation. In this study, we employed a heteroatom doping strategy to optimize the photocatalytic parameters and achieve excellent efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ product formation. Our experimental analysis revealed that the local electronic structure of the catalyst, modified by In&#8208;doping, enables enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of Cu facilitates the coupling of C1 intermediates, resulting in excellent selectivity towards C2+ products. The CO2 reduction performance is further enhanced through exfoliation, which increases the exposure of active sites and extends the charge carrier lifetime by reducing the charge diffusion length. We report that the rate of formation of C2H4 reached 54.3&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 with an outstanding selectivity of 91% over the exfoliated CuIn&#8208;doped AgBiP2S6 catalyst. By elucidating the role of heteroatom doping and exfoliation in enhancing both the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation, our study contributes to advancing the development of sustainable and efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion technologies.

         <title>Silylchromium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Semihydrogenation of Undirected Allenes by Sila&#8208;Metalation and &#946;&#8208;Silyl Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted allenes without a directing group underwent chromium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and regioselective semihydrogenation with an (alkyl)(amino)carbene&#8208;phosphine ligand and a chlorosilane additive. The silylchromium complex formed in situ promotes semihydrogenation through a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of the allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination, with the silyl group acting as a noninnocent ligand to give E&#8208;alkene products selectively. 








Abstract
The semihydrogenation of simple allenes remains an issue because of the difficulty in controlling of selectivity without coordination assistance from directing groups, wherein over&#8208;hydrogenated alkanes and E/Z&#8208;mixed stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;isomers can be potentially formed. We report here an electron&#8208;rich cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;phosphine&#8208;ligated chromium(III) complex serving as precatalyst in promoting the selective semihydrogenation of undirected allenes by forming active silylchromium species. The semihydrogenation allows the selective addition of H2 to the less substituted and electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted C&#9552;C bonds of allenes while enabling the suppression of competitive over&#8208;hydrogenation, proving generally to form trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenes in high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. By this CAAC&#8208;phosphine&#8208;Cr&#8208;catalyzed selective semihydrogenation, unsaturated nitro, nitrile, alkenyl, and hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive bromide, chloride, and fluoride were compatible with various substitution environments. The in situ forming silylchromium as active catalyst by reaction of low&#8208;valent chromium complex with chlorosilane was established by studying the catalytic and stoichiometric reactivity of this species in the semihydrogenation. Deuterium labeling experiments, HRMS, XPS, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility analysis of the related intermediates and theoretical studies support a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination processes with silyl as noninnocent ligand, leading to the E&#8208;alkene products.

         <title>Lysine&#8208;Targeting, Covalent Inhibitors of Bromodomain BD1 of BET Proteins in Live Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully developed the first BD1&#8208;targted covalent inhibitor (TCI), BDS4, by utilizing 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA). Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to the marginal effects of BD2 inhibitor RVX&#8208;208. Our developed tool showed clear advantages of long&#8208;lasting domain&#8208;selective TCI in delineating the district function of BD1 and BD2. 








Abstract
The bromodomain extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan&#8208;BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1&#8208; or BD2&#8208;selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine&#8208;reactive covalent warheads herein we report a set of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; P3&#8211;P7) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals. Chemoproteomic experiments with P7, which utilizes 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA), identified 16 endogenous BRDs, thus giving a global landscape of ligandable lysines in BRDs. By further introducing EBA and salicylaldehyde into PLX51107 (a noncovalent BETi), we generated lysine&#8208;reactive, irreversible (BDS1&#8211;4) and reversible (BDS5&#8211;6) BD1 covalent inhibitors. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the successful covalent engagement between EBA and K91 near the acetylated lysine (Kac)&#8208;binding site of BD1 in BRD4. BDS4 showed 104&#8208;fold selectivity for BD1 over BD2 with prolonged anticancer effects. Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to RVX&#8208;208 (a reported BD2&#8208;selective noncovalent inhibitor), which showed only marginal effects. Our work serves as a useful tool to delineate distinct functions of BD1 and BD2 in future studies.

         <title>Aptamer as a Molecular Tethering Agent Induces PrPC Aggregation and Degradation to Inhibit Melanoma Proliferation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a molecular tethering agent, TTe&#8208;TTe, that binds to the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. TTe&#8208;TTe suppresses malignant melanoma proliferation by triggering PrPC to aggregate on the cell membrane surface, followed by its degradation. This versatile platform technology opens up new avenues for targeted protein degradation in a wide range of therapeutic applications, potentially advancing the field of drug discovery.








Abstract
Melanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane&#8208;bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell&#8208;SELEX and cell&#8208;internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT&#8208;1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT&#8208;1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT&#8208;1e, we engineered an aptamer&#8208;based molecular tethering agent TTe&#8208;TTe. We found that TTe&#8208;TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe&#8208;TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.

TTe-TTe suppresses malignant melanoma proliferation by triggering PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; to aggregate on the cell membrane surface, followed by its degradation. This versatile platform technology opens up new avenues for targeted protein degradation in a wide range of therapeutic applications, potentially advancing the field of drug discovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; protein levels by inducing membrane-bound PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell-SELEX and cell-internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT-1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT-1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on the binding characteristics of TT-1e, we engineered an aptamer-based molecular tethering agent TTe-TTe. We found that TTe-TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe-TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm-shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Nanographenes Through Domino Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis enables nanographene fabrication but with limited reactions. Here, bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene undergoes domino cyclization via cycloisomerization, cyclodehydrogenation, and formyl cyclization, yielding dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene. STM, STS, and DFT analyses reveal their structures and properties, advancing carbon nanostructure synthesis.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful method to synthesize nanographenes that are difficult to obtain through the solution chemistry, but the number of available reactions is still highly limited. In this study, we demonstrate an unprecedented on&#8208;surface domino cyclization of bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene, leading to dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene through a sequence of 1) cycloisomerization of diaryldiacetylene moieties, 2) oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, and 3) reductive cyclization of formyl groups. The structures of these nanographenes and other cyclized products were unambiguously elucidated by using scanning tunneling microscopy directly on Au(111). Moreover, their electronic properties were investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Our findings offer new insights into the on&#8208;surface cyclization reactions, providing an effective strategy for synthesizing a wider variety of carbon nanostructures.

         <title>The ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD0156 Is a Potent Inhibitor of Plasmodium Phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;Kinase (PI4K&#946;) and Is an Attractive Candidate for Medicinal Chemistry Optimization Against Malaria</title>

         <dc:description>
AZD0156, an ATM kinase inhibitor in clinical development, shows promising multistage antiplasmodial activity by targeting Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase (PfPI4K&#946;). With an improved specificity profile relative to other PfPI4K&#946; inhibitors and moderate efficacy in a P. berghei disease model, AZD0156 is an attractive candidate for medicinal chemistry optimization against malaria.








Abstract
New compounds targeting human malaria parasites are critical for effective malaria control and elimination. Here, we pursued the imidazoquinolinone AZD0156 (MMV1580483), a human ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor that completed Phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. We validated its in vitro activity against the two main forms of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the human host, viz. the asexual blood (symptomatic) stage and sexual gametocyte (transmission) stage. Resistance selection, cross&#8208;resistance, biochemical, and conditional knockdown studies revealed that AZD0156 inhibits P. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase type III beta (PfPI4K&#946;), a clinically&#8208;validated target for the treatment of malaria. Metabolic perturbations, fixed&#8208;ratio isobolograms, killing kinetics and morphological evaluation correlated AZD0156 inhibition with other known PI4K&#946; inhibitors. The compound showed favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and 81% antimalarial efficacy (4 &#215; 50 mg kg&#8722;1) in a P. berghei mouse malaria infection model. Importantly, a cleaner biochemical profile was measured against human kinases (MAP4K4, MINK1) implicated in embryofoetal developmental toxicity associated with the PfPI4K&#946; inhibitor MMV390048. This improved kinase selectivity profile and structural differentiation from other PI4K&#946; inhibitors, together with its multistage antiplasmodial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, makes AZD0156 an attractive candidate for target&#8208;based drug repositioning against malaria via a medicinal chemistry optimization approach.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Efficiency Through Precision Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8208;acceptor 3D COFs synthesized via Schiff base reactions were integrated into perovskite solar cells&#8217; SAMs. Their architecture enabled efficient charge separation, stable interfacial anchoring, and optimized energy alignment, enhancing hole transport and perovskite quality and reduced defect density. This achieving PCEs up to 25.20%, demonstrating COFs' potential in advancing PSC efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of porous polymers with tunable 2D or 3D structures, have drawn significant attention for their exceptional versatility across various applications. Recently, the integration of COFs into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address critical challenges, such as instability, interfacial recombination losses, and lead&#8208;associated environmental risks. Enhanced charge transport channels, passivation of defects, and customizable molecule architectures are some of the special benefits that COFs offer. In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self&#8208;assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect&#8208;assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP&#8208;BE) and 24.21% (DP&#8208;DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.

         <title>Noncovalent Synthesis of Topological Heterostructures Using a Site&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly (SSECA) strategy was developed to fabricate a variety of topological heterostructures (THSs) with unprecedented architectures from two&#8208;component systems of organometallic complexes and block copolymers. The THSs are composed of rigid parts of closely stacked organometallic complexes and flexible segments formed from electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of BCPs and the complexes originally in the SPs. 








Abstract
Heterostructured nanomaterials composed of heterogeneous zones with dramatically different chemical and/or physical properties have attracted significant attention. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare 1D crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co&#8208;assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber&#8208;like moieties. The co&#8208;assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co&#8208;assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher&#8208;order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.

&lt;p&gt;A site-selective electrostatic co-assembly (SSECA) strategy was developed to fabricate a variety of topological heterostructures (THSs) with unprecedented architectures from two-component systems of organometallic complexes and block copolymers. The THSs are composed of rigid parts of closely stacked organometallic complexes and flexible segments formed from electrostatic co-assembly of BCPs and the complexes originally in the SPs. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterostructured nanomaterials composed of heterogeneous zones with dramatically different chemical and/or physical properties have attracted significant attention. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site-selective electrostatic co-assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare 1D crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co-assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)-&lt;i&gt;block&lt;/i&gt;-poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co-assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber-like moieties. The co-assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co-assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher-order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allylic Substitution of Unprotected Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical allylic substitution method that directly functionalizes unprotected allylic alcohols, eliminating the need for prefunctionalization and toxic reagents. Utilizing iron's unique redox and oxophilic properties, this approach offers a step&#8208;economic and sustainable pathway to allylic functionalization. This method expands the synthetic toolbox and demonstrates the versatility of outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms in radical&#8208;based reactions, facilitating the efficient synthesis of diverse molecular architectures.








Abstract
Allylic substitution reactions are essential in organic synthesis, enabling the transformation of allylic reagents into diverse alkenes. Traditional methods, which typically operate through ionic pathways, often require substrate preactivation to address high C&#9472;O bond dissociation energies, leading to challenges in regioselectivity and limited substrate compatibility. Here, we introduce an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway for allylic substitution that directly activates unprotected allylic alcohols, leveraging the redox and oxophilic properties of low&#8208;valent iron to promote selective C&#9472;O bond cleavage and allylic transposition. This radical approach achieves high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, providing access to a broad array of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes with moderate to excellent yields and exceptional E/Z selectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm that the iron catalyst generates radical intermediates and mediates efficient dehydroxylation, enabling this direct transformation without protective groups or Lewis acid activators. The method's versatility is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope, including complex natural derivatives and functionalized alkyl halides, along with successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream derivatization. This iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional ionic methods, expanding the scope of allylic substitutions and advancing radical&#8208;based methodologies in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>A Simple Quinoid Building Block for Polymer Semiconductors with Tunable Polarity and High n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Performance</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple quinoid building block TTD, featuring small steric hindrance and high electron deficiency, was obtained via a one&#8208;step synthesis. Unexpectedly, the TTD&#8208;based polymers showed tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, and the n&#8208;doped polymers attained remarkable thermoelectric performance with a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. 








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers with deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron&#8208;deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), via one step from a low&#8208;cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.91&#160;eV for PQD and &#8722;3.73&#160;eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n&#8208;doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and finally to n&#8208;type in organic field&#8208;effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n&#8208;doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n&#8208;doped quinoid&#8208;based polymers. This work underscores the great potential of structurally simple and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Approach for Tunable and Efficient Circularly Polarized Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;covalent supramolecular and intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strategy, employing bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) and judicious choice of donors, enabled tunable circularly polarized delayed luminescence in the red region with a high quantum yield of &#8764;46% and a significant |glum| value of up to &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2.








Abstract
Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states. While supramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions are well&#8208;established to improve |glum| by enhancing magnetic transition dipole components, their application to triplet&#8208;harvesting organic systems remains unexplored. In this context, our current work introduces a supramolecular strategy to achieve highly efficient and tunable circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence by the involvement of intermolecular triplet CT states. Through&#8208;space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (&#8764;46%) and a significant |glum| &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2. Additionally, the modularity of this non&#8208;covalent design allows for the tuning of emission from the orange to deep&#8208;red regions by incorporating various donors. The strategy presented here opens new avenues for designing efficient CPL&#8208;active organic phosphors.

         <title>Supramolecular Ion Channels to Engineer Zn2+ Ion Transport Mediated Chemical&#8208;to&#8208;Optical Signal Transduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular communication system has been developed to monitor Zn2+ ion transport&#8208;mediated chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process.








Abstract
Artificial ion channels have significant potential for various applications, including molecular communication, bio&#8208;sensing, and constructing artificial cells. In this report, we demonstrated the development of a molecular communication system that transports ions across the lipid bilayers via the formation of supramolecular ion channels and harnesses chemical reactions to overcome the challenges of executing signal&#8208;processing functions at the molecular level. The potent ionophore self&#8208;assembles into nanochannels within the lipid bilayers and selectively transports Zn2+ ions. The movement of Zn2+ ions through these supramolecular ion channels enables the in situ generation of a water&#8208;soluble catalytic system with tyrosine. This catalytic system promotes esterase&#8208;like activity, generating fluorescent reporters from non&#8208;fluorescent ester&#8208;based compounds within the intravesicular environment. Furthermore, this process indicates the formation of a three&#8208;input AND logic gate in the fluorescence mode, allowing the monitoring of the chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process akin to biological counterparts. Developing these molecular communication systems to replicate the complexity of natural cellular processes opens up exciting opportunities for designing advanced biomimetic tools and exploring the fundamental principles underlying cellular communication.

Developing these molecular communication systems to replicate the complexity of natural cellular processes opens up exciting opportunities for designing advanced biomimetic tools and exploring the fundamental principles underlying cellular communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Initial Coulombic Efficiency in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;based Cathodes by Tuning Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the potential of Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, highlighting the critical challenges posed by low initial coulombic efficiency and irreversible oxygen release. We introduce a novel treatment method using Glyoxal, which facilitates the integration of transition metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbital hybridization, aimed at optimizing the electrochemical performance of LRMO. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in ICE, increasing from 85.3% to 102.5%. Additionally, the treated LRMO achieves a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, surpassing untreated samples, and exhibits excellent cycling stability with retention rates of 90.1% after 150 cycles and 76.5% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. 








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMO) are promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;cost merits. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and irreversible oxygen release of LRMO severely hinder their commercialization processes. Here, we employ glyoxal treatment to modulate the hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen (O) 2p orbitals in LRMO. This approach is found to reduce the Co/Mn t2g&#8208;O 2p hybridization in LRMO while simultaneously activating the Co2+/Co3+ redox below the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that tuning TM 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization can be a viable approach to improve the ICE of LMRO. Specifically, the ICE of LRMO can be elevated from 85.3% to 102.5%, and a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 0.1 C. Moreover, the treated LRMO cathodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacity retention.

         <title>Boosting Urea Electrosynthesis via Asymmetric Oxygen Vacancies in Zn&#8208;Doped Fe2O3 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>

The Zn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 catalysts with Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites can promote the conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO and the coupling of *NO + *CO and thus improve the urea electrosynthesis. It exhibits an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% with a production rate of 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) provides an attractive pathway for storing renewable electricity and substituting traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. However, the kinetics mismatching between CO2 reduction and NO3&#8722; reduction, as well as the difficulty of C&#9472;N coupling, are major challenges in urea electrosynthesis. Herein, we first calculated the free energy of *CO, *OCNO, and *NOH formation over defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts with different metal dopants, which showed that Zn dopant was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we developed Zn&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts (Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV) containing asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites. It exhibited an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% and the remarkable recycling stability. The production rate of urea was as high as 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, which is higher than most of the reported works to date. Detailed control experiments and in situ spectroscopy analyses identified *OCNO as a crucial intermediate for C&#9472;N coupling. The Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV catalyst with asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites showed enhanced *CO coverage and promoted *OCNO formation, leading to high efficiency toward urea production.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Generation via Peroxide&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages of peroxide redox chemistry are explored for green hydrogen production. Peroxide redox electrocatalysts enable efficient and selective peroxide production and oxidation, facilitating on&#8208;site hydrogen generation while achieving a nearly 50% reduction in applied potential compared to conventional water&#8208;splitting methods. An integrated bipolar&#8208;ion gradient system further reduces energy requirements to nearly one&#8208;third of traditional electrolysis.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) production through water electrolysis is a promising route for sustainable energy storage. However, conventional water electrolysis faces several challenges, such as large thermodynamic potential gaps and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics, which lead to high electricity consumption and limitations in H2 storage and transportation. A promising approach to overcoming these hurdles is hybrid water electrolysis, which integrates alternative, thermodynamically favorable reactions at the anode to enhance efficiency. In this study, we explore how peroxide redox electrocatalysis can address critical barriers in sustainable H2 production, storage, and transport. By leveraging a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient peroxide redox electrocatalyst, we demonstrate various electrolysis configurations that significantly reduce the required cell voltage&#8212;from the standard 1.23&#160;V down to &#8722;0.06&#160;V, highlighting its potential for scalable and economically viable electrolysis methodologies for H2 production.

         <title>Induced Chirality and Vibrational Optical Activity in an Ionic&#8208;Liquid Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality can be induced in an ionic liquid anion. Normally, the enantiomeric conformers are equally populated, and no optical activity is observed. However, if a chiral probe molecule (e.g., propylene oxide) is added, a non&#8208;symmetric redistribution of the conformers occurs, chirally imprinting the ionic liquid.








Abstract
Here, we show that the four conformers of the regularly used ionic liquid anion bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [NTf2]&#8722;$[{\rm NTf}_2]^{-}$ are true enantiomeric pairs by analyzing their calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra. The significant modes involve those atoms of the anion that form specific hydrogen bond patterns with the chiral probe molecule propylene oxide. Adding this probe molecule to the ionic liquid 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, the experimental and simulated spectra indicate intermolecular interaction between the chiral molecule and the liquid and thus the induction of chirality in the anion. This emergence of chirality in the ionic liquid takes place via the hydrogen bonding between the anion of the ionic liquid and the solute, which results in a redistribution of the symmetric occurrence of conformers to an asymmetric one. Altogether, this study reveals the mechanism of chiral induction from the propylene oxide molecule to the ionic liquid anion, while pointing out the importance of rational over a random choice of the ionic liquid building units.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange Reactions as Self&#8208;Blowing Agents for the Production of Reprocessable Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative approach to designing self&#8208;blown foams by leveraging the irreversible and self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification of alkylester which release alcohol gas as blowing agents. The morphology and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of these foams can be precisely tailored by modifying the precursor structure. Remarkably, they can be reprocessed as rigid resins through reversible self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Thermosetting foams are crucial in the polymer industry due to their unique lightweight and durable properties. Recent developments in sustainable chemistry intend to align foam lifecycles toward circular economy principles and reduce their environmental impact. In this study, this issue is addressed thanks to an innovative and straightforward approach, enabling the manufacture of single&#8208;component self&#8208;blowing vitrimer foam. The self&#8208;blowing mechanism originates from the in situ formation and release of the blowing agent via the polycondensation of an alkylester. This alkylester, composed of a benzoxazine matrix terminated with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine, undergoes in a cascade mechanism ring opening polymerization (ROP) and irreversible transesterification exchange, which in turn generates an alcohol gas. The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine&#8208;tuned to develop various foams that have an open&#8208;cell morphology, volume expansion of 223%&#8211;853%, porosity of 67%&#8211;86%, and compression modulus in the range of 3&#8211;38&#160;MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine&#8208;co&#8208;ester) network composed of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl, and &#946;&#8208;aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam&#8208;to&#8208;resin reprocessing.

         <title>Dihydrophenazine Derived Pd6L12 Cage: Self&#8208;Assembly, Polyradical Cations, and Lithium Battery Cathode Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesized a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12 coordination cage (Cage 1) with excellent redox activity. It can reversibly transform into its radical cation form (112&#8226;+) via electrochemical or chemical oxidation/reduction. Both forms' structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In situ spectroelectrochemical techniques verified their redox reversibility and electrochromic behavior. Cage 1 was also used as a lithium battery cathode, with its redox behavior studied by in situ 2D EPR.








Abstract
In this study, we present the self&#8208;assembly of a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12&#8208;type coordination cage 1 showing excellent redox activity and demonstrate the use as the cathode for lithium batteries. The structure of cage 1 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The excellent reversible redox performance of 1 and its electrochromic properties induced by radical species were systematically characterized using in situ UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Notably, a highly stable radical cationic species 112&#8226;+, containing 12 radical cations, was successfully obtained through the chemical oxidation of 1, and its single&#8208;crystal structure was resolved. The excellent redox properties of 1 enable its application as a cathode material for lithium batteries. The 1|Li cell exhibited good cycling stability, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, and an initial discharge capacity of 84 mAh g&#8315;&#185; within a voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.0&#160;V. Furthermore, in situ 2D EPR experiments on lithium batteries visually revealed the excellent cycling stability of the 1&#8208;based cathode material and its reversible two&#8208;step electron transfer process. This study provides important insights into the design, synthesis, and properties of functionalized redox&#8208;active coordination cages, offering a reference for their application in energy storage and functional materials research.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosome SMLM Imaging as Indicators for Functional Diagnostics with a Low&#8208;Phototoxic Spontaneously Blinking Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR spontaneously blinking fluorophore, Aze&#8208;HMSiR, optimized for long&#8208;term SMLM imaging of lysosomes is developed. It exhibits superior photostability, pH responsiveness, and minimal phototoxicity. Aze&#8208;HMSiR can reveal key lysosomal characteristics, including distribution, size, and lumen pH, in response to various anticancer agents. Such whole&#8208;cell lysosome SMLM imaging serves as a valuable indicator for lysosomal functional diagnostics.








Abstract
Lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics are key indicators of lysosomal function, making long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging a promising tool for functional diagnostics. However, phototoxicity often compromises imaging reliability. Here, we develop Aze&#8208;HMSiR, a spontaneously blinking silicon rhodamine probe with near&#8208;infrared excitation, enabling low&#8208;phototoxicity, long&#8208;term (50 min) SMLM imaging of lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics. This probe provides super&#8208;resolution insights into lysosomal distribution, size, and lumen pH, essential for understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Using Aze&#8208;HMSiR, we investigate lysosomal function under acidosis, starvation, and anticancer drug treatments. Among seven tested drugs, periplocoside significantly reduced lysosomal size, while paclitaxel increased pH and altered lysosomal distribution. These findings highlight Aze&#8208;HMSiR as a powerful tool for lysosomal functional diagnostics and drug screening, offering a robust platform for studying lysosomal dynamics in response to physiological and pharmacological perturbations, particularly in cancer therapy.

         <title>Manipulation of Hydrogen Transfer Behaviors by RhCu Alloying Enables an All&#8208;in&#8208;one Sustainable &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system by coupling the rational conversions from nitrogen&#8208;oxysalts and biomass&#8208;derived&#8208;aldehydes (industrial/agricultural wastes). The poor reaction kinetics are efficaciously optimized by RhCu alloy electrocatalyst with dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation properties. So, nitrate and furfural can be simultaneously converted into multiple non&#8208;mixed valuable products (NH3, H2, etc.) with electricity output.








Abstract
Nitrate&#160;and furfural are typical wastes mainly from industrialization and agriculturalization progresses, and their clean conversions are still very challenging for a sustainable future. Nevertheless, scant attention has been devoted to the core&#160;issues: the rational integration of two wastes recycling and the targeted manipulation of hydrogen (H*) transfer behaviors to address their sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system that is thermodynamically designed by coupling nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and furfural oxidation reactions (FORs) together. Particularly, the poor kinetics for both electrode reactions are efficaciously optimized by the bifunctional electrocatalyst of RhCu alloy nanowires on copper foam (RhCu NW/CF) with highly improved dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation performances, thus initializing NO3RR for NH3 synthesis at +0.31&#160;V and driving FOR for H2 harvest at an onset potential lower than 0&#160;V. Eventually, such integrated &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; system can simultaneously effectuate the electricity energy supply (10.76&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), wastewater purification, cathodic hydrogen storage (NH3), anodic H2 production, and biomass upgrading. Hence, it provides a promising perspective of &#8220;turning waste into treasure&#8221; in a rational manner, justifying its all&#8208;in&#8208;one property in addressing the global challenge of sustainable energy.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides Catalyze Rate&#8208;Determining Redox in Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals how entropy regulates sulfur utilization and cycling stability in aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries. High&#8208;entropy (HES) catalysts enable optimized Zn&#8211;S redox pathways and structural integrity, achieving high sulfur utilization and stable cycling. In contrast, low&#8208; (LES) and medium&#8208;entropy (MES) catalysts show inefficient reactions with by&#8208;product formation and Mn/Co leaching, degrading performance. Practical validation demonstrates HES&#8208;based pouch cells maintain exceptional stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with merely 0.06% capacity decay per cycle, establishing entropy engineering as a practical design strategy. 








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8211;solid Zn&#8211;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional low&#8208;entropy catalysts suffer from poor stability, leading to leaching effects and water splitting during cycling. To overcome these limitations, we present a three&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8211;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS2 to wurtzite ZnS. Furthermore, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. In contrast, utilizing medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy catalysts results in the formation of by&#8208;products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Consequently, the pouch cell with the HES catalysts delivers a high cathode energy density of 313&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high cycling stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. This entropy&#8208;driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Spin State Modulation in Spinel Oxides for Enhanced Nonradical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights a strategy that leverages site&#8208;specific spin state modulation in spinel oxides, which optimizes site&#8208;specific functionalities and enhances the overall nonradical oxidation reaction kinetics by 22&#8208;fold. XAS, magnetism characterization combined with theoretical calculation unveil the establishment of a QSEI that facilitates spin channel for charge transfer and the RDS desorption with a lower&#8208;ICOHP in fine&#8208;tuned spin states.








Abstract
Spinel oxides hold tremendous potential for driving advanced oxidation processes, yet the underlying mechanism for maximizing their activity remains unclear. In this study, we leverage tetrahedral and octahedral site interactions in MnxCo3&#8208;xO4 to modulate the spin states, specifically spin alignment and spin moment, thereby enhancing periodate (PI) activation and catalytic performance in contaminant degradation. Through combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) analyses, we elucidate the role of spin alignment at synergetic tetrahedral and octahedral sites in facilitating quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) with an efficient electronic spin channel for charge transfer. Meanwhile, the engineered high spin configuration in CoMn2O4 raises the d&#8208;band center, favoring stable PI* surface complex formation and accelerating the rate&#8208;determining desorption of IO3&#8722; with a lower&#8208;ICOHP value during the catalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin. As a result, the fine&#8208;tuned spin state of CoMn2O4 leads to enhanced overall reaction kinetics, with a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to MnCo2O4 and up to 22&#8208;fold increase compared to the octahedrally&#8208;active only catalysts. Such a site&#8208;specific modulation has been found applicable to other spinel oxides, enlightening fine&#8208;tuned electronic structure for maximizing catalytic performance.

         <title>Hierarchically Self&#8208;Assembled Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Gels for Guest Segregation and Electrical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates were developed that can be utilized as filling material in columns and showed the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. The host&#8208;guest properties could also be monitored in real time by electrical characterization. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation.








Abstract
The search for macroscopic materials with differentially addressable spaces based on molecular containers has long been driven by their great potential for diverse practical applications pertaining guest selective capture and release. Herein, we report a class of gels (G1&#8208;NH2, G1&#8208;UPy, G2&#8208;NH2, and G2&#8208;UPy) that are formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of anion&#8208;coordinated architectures. The well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of the cavities within anion&#8208;coordinated architectures endow the gels with different internal phases, which is beneficial to differentiate the release profiles of guest molecules (dimethylethanolamine, choline, and propyl trimethylammonium) depending on their binding affinity. This study also introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization. This work may thus provide a useful strategy for selective solid&#8208;phase molecular separation.

         <title>Phenacetin[3]Arenes: Mannich&#8208;Type Macrocyclization, Unique Structure, Versatile Functionalization, and Strong Allosteric Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;step acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation of phenacetin and its analogues with paraformaldehyde provides a facile route to hourglass&#8208;shaped phenacetin[3]arenes with distinct functionalized rims in good yields. These novel macrocyclic arene show excellent binding properties and offer the potential for chirality sensing.








Abstract
This work introduces a novel NAm&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr macrocyclization pathway, diverging from the conventional CAr&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr linkages prevalent in macrocyclic arenes. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot condensation of &#8208; Phenacetin and its homologs with formaldehyde, yielding phenacetin[3]arenes (Ph[3]s) in yields up to 25.9%. Ph[3] exhibits an unsymmetrical hourglass&#8208;shaped architecture, featuring an upper rim adorned with amide groups and a lower rim comprising an alkoxylbenzene cavity. This unique structure facilitates reversible equilibrium between conformers via benzene ring flipping, which simultaneously reverses the orientation of amide groups, establishing equilibrium between C3 and F conformers. Increasing concentrations of organic ammonium guests lead to a transition from a predominantly 1:1 to 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexation. The estimated binding constants for the 1:1 complexes are in the order of 104&#8211;105&#160;M&#8722;1, the overall binding constants for the 1:2 complexes are greater than 106&#160;M&#8722;2. This stepwise complexation triggers a conformational shift from the C3 to F conformer, demonstrating intriguing allosteric behavior. Furthermore, interactions with chiral guests selectively influence the equilibrium of planar chiral conformers, generating chiroptical responses suitable for chirality sensing applications. The distinct functional groups on the two rims facilitate diverse chemical modifications, including reduction, deprotection, and condensation, providing synthetic flexibility for post&#8208;chemical modifications.

By tuning the rigidity and length of DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNAs, we demonstrate a universal strategy for designing 1D porous crystals with tailored geometries and topologies, enabling advanced catalytic applications.








Abstract
The physicochemical properties of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) porous nanomaterials are fundamentally influenced by their channel geometrical and topological characteristics. However, synthesis of geometrically and topologically diversified 1D porous crystals spanning the mesoporous&#8208;to&#8208;macroporous range remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a universal strategy for constructing 1D open&#8208;channel superlattices through edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly (edge&#8208;bonding) of DNA&#8208;sparsely modified meta&#8208;DNA (M&#8208;DNA). By programming the rigidity and length of sparsely distributed DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNA surfaces, we achieved long&#8208;range ordered assembly of triangular M&#8208;DNA 1D single&#8208;channel superlattice (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;&#181;m) with a macroporous structure. The generality of this approach was further demonstrated by assembling hexagonal M&#8208;DNA into 1D multi&#8208;channel superlattice (3.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.0&#160;&#181;m) with a mesoporous structure, thereby reducing the pore size from 140 to 29&#160;nm and the porosity from &#8764;94.2 to &#8764;87.5%. Furthermore, an ultrathin gold layer grown on the triangular M&#8208;DNA superlattice exhibited a &#8764;3.3&#8208;fold enhancement in electrocatalytic activity compared to non&#8208;assembled triangular M&#8208;DNA, attributed to the increased surface area and narrower bandgap. This work broadens the design framework for porous crystals assembled via DNA nanotechnology and highlights their potential applications in catalysis, energy conversion, and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;The physicochemical properties of one-dimensional (1D) porous nanomaterials are fundamentally influenced by their channel geometrical and topological characteristics. However, synthesis of geometrically and topologically diversified 1D porous crystals spanning the mesoporous-to-macroporous range remains a significant challenge.

         <title>Multiple and Alternative Sites Make Tau Protein an Adaptable Sticky Surface for the SH3 Domain of Fyn Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based study, combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET methods, sheds light on the complex recognition mechanism between the intrinsically disordered protein Tau and the SH3 domain of Fyn kinase, highlighting how the multiple binding sites present in Tau make the protein an adaptable recognition surface that can function even when single consensus motifs are eliminated.








Abstract
The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline&#8208;rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline&#8208;rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn&#8208;SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full&#8208;length Tau protein by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) methods. Both in vitro and in&#8208;cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn&#8208;SH3 contacts full&#8208;length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate&#8208;to&#8208;low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non&#8208;canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.

         <title>High&#8208;Security and High&#8208;Efficiency Information Encryption/Decryption Based on 2D Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites via Delicate Organic&#8208;Cation Engineering</title>

We develop a unique strategy of information encryption/decryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence of 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering. The facile triple&#8208;key implementation working in multiple switching modes (featuring high contrast and quick response) allows us to achieve high security and readout efficiency, opening a new door to information security based on optical encryption.








Abstract
Optical encryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (SRL) materials has received enormous interest in the field of information security. Metal&#8211;halide perovskites, as a newly emerging SRL material, have shown great potential for confidential information encryption/decryption (InfoED) applications. However, it is rather challenging to ensure high security and achieve high readout efficiency in perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED. Herein, we present a unique InfoED strategy using 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering, benefiting from the high contrast and quick response of their photoluminescence behaviors. Indistinguishably encrypted information can be efficiently decrypted through triple&#8208;key implementation (i.e., ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation, temperature control, and narrow&#8208;bandpass filtering) that operates in multiple switching modes, enabling us to demonstrate extremely high security by adopting dot&#8208;matrix patterning scenarios that are virtually uncrackable. As a proof of principle, a simple 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 patterning can yield a code dictionary with random variants as high as &#8764;1047, which will take as long as &#8764;1022 years to crack using the hitherto fastest supercomputer, El Capitan. Our perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED strategy provides a promising solution for information security based on optical encryption.

         <title>Production of H2O2 via Energy Transfer Photocatalysis by Coupling with Furfuryl Alcohol Conversion over an Amide&#8208;Functionalized Heptazine Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;based photocatalysis can be switched to a novel energy transfer route for efficient and selective 1O2 generation through amide functionalization to modulate the electronic structure of the photocatalyst, thus providing a promising approach for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction provides a sustainable approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the charge carrier&#8208;based pathway is severely limited by inefficient charge separation and redox decomposition of the produced H2O2. Energy transfer photocatalysis (EnTP) is an alternative charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;free route for H2O2 synthesis. Herein, we propose a strategy of killing two birds with one stone to simultaneously realize the synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative by coupling EnTP with the Achmatowicz reaction. Results show efficient production of H2O2 at a rate of 14.6&#8201;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1&#160;and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 44.1% at 420&#8201;nm, coupled with the conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfuryl alcohol (FFA) into hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;3(6H)&#8208;one with a high selectivity of 85.9%. Such a performance was attributed to the efficient EnTP over the amide&#8208;functionalized heptazine framework photocatalyst for singlet oxygen generation, which induces the FFA conversion and concurrently produces H2O2. A systematic study of the photoexcitation process of the catalysts reveals that the amide functionalization significantly improves the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency, as the structural modification optimizes the electronic structure and thus tunes the composition and distribution of energy bands.

         <title>Antiparallel &#946;&#8208;Sheet as a Key Motif of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Inhibitor Designed via Topological Peptide Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>

Targeting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregation requires a peptide&#8208;based approach that accounts for the structural heterogeneity of A&#946;. Here, we employ topological reprogramming via disulfide bonds to stabilize antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets within the dimeric peptide. This strategy overcomes limitations of linear peptides by creating structured complexes that resist aggregation, offering a novel tactic for tackling AD&#8208;related protein aggregation.








Abstract
Peptide inhibitor design targeting self&#8208;assembly of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) represents a promising strategy for suppressing the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional approaches have primarily mimicked repetitive sequences found in fibrillar structures of A&#946; aggregates. However, since the inherent flexibility of A&#946; structures promotes the structural changes in the early&#8208;stage oligomerization, a structural modulation should be considered in the design of peptide inhibitors. Herein, we introduce topological reprogramming of peptides to control the structural transformation in pathogenic A&#946; 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42). The eleven&#8208;residue peptide scaffold Pa11 (14HQKLVNFAEDV24) identified through the initial screening was dimerized via a disulfide bond. The dimerization stabilizes A&#946;42 into higher order structures by promoting antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations, thereby significantly suppressing A&#946;42 aggregation. Our approach underscores that modification in peptide connectivity would be a breakthrough for controlling the intrinsic flexibility of A&#946;, surpassing the limitation in conventional, one&#8208;dimensional peptide building block.

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Ionic Liquids by Combined Pulse EPR and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids have been proposed as alternatives to molecular solvents. Here, spin probes and spin&#8208;labelled ILs are studied by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, revealing the IL interaction sphere. The results challenge previous interpretations of nitroxide&#8208;solvent nanostructuring in ILs.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are a unique class of compounds that have attracted interest for numerous and diverse applications, ranging from solvents for sustainable synthesis to sustainable electrolytes. Understanding their nanostructure and solute&#8208;solvent interactions is a prerequisite to harnessing the full potential of ILs. It has been proposed that ILs solvate non&#8208;polar solutes via their alkyl chains through the formation of nanoscale structures, such as micelles. Here, we determine the non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for such nanostructuring in ILs. We use pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with ILs tailored to probe specific interactions through spin and isotopic labelling. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular cation&#8211;anion interactions are probed by electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and 19F PRE experiments and show that nitroxide solutes associate with the polar domains of the imidazolium cation through weak hydrogen bonding with the imidazolium ring protons, as supported by MD simulations. Thus, this study reveals a less structured nanostructure than a micellar picture might suggest, but with clear IL cation&#8208;solute interactions. Our methodology to reveal nanostructure not only has implications for ILs but is also applicable to other soft matter systems.

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclohexane Ring Formation in Forazoline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FrazP2, a cytochrome P450, catalyzes cyclohexane ring formation in forazoline A, a marine&#8208;derived antifungal from Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499. Structural and mechanistic studies have uncovered a radical&#8208;mediated cyclization, unlocking opportunities to engineer P450s for the generation of novel antifungal forazoline analogues.








Abstract
Forazoline A, produced by the marine actinomycete Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499, is a unique PK/NRP hybrid macrolactone with promising antifungal in vivo efficacy through a previously unreported mechanism. Although a PKS/NRPS gene cluster was identified as a candidate for forazoline production, the precise biosynthetic pathway and the functions of the tailoring enzymes remain unclear. In this work, the functions of three cytochrome P450 mono&#8208;oxygenases (FrazP1P2P3) were characterized. Notably, FrazP2 was found to mediate cyclohexane ring formation from an 1,3,6&#8208;triene precursor during forazoline A biosynthesis, as confirmed by genetic and biochemical analysis. To gain structural and mechanistic insight into the activity of FrazP2, the crystal structure of a FrazP2&#8208;substrate complex has been solved at 2.3&#160;&#197; resolution. The molecular dynamics simulations and DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction by FrazP2. These findings expand our understanding of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome P450s, contributing to the diversification of natural products and enabling the creation of unnatural derivatives with increased antifungal potency.

         <title>Rhodium/Indium Heterobimetallic Alloy as an Effective Catalyst for Reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O Silylation of Ethers with Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging.

C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic small molecules as well as polymers. The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks.

Indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors due to their large Bohr exciton radius and tunable bandgap in the 0.6&#8211;1.3&#160;eV range. However, the formation of metal oxides on InSb surfaces during synthesis impedes charge transport, necessitating CQD resurfacing strategies for integration into photodetectors. Previous reports achieved progress in device efficiency by resurfacing these CQDs with acid&#8208;halide sequential treatments, but the device operating stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a solution&#8208;phase strategy for surface reconstruction and passivation of InSb CQDs using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. We find that short&#8208;chain thiol molecules remove surface metal oxides through nucleophilic attack and enable robust passivation of In and Sb via strong covalent bonds, whereas metal sulfides are less effective at oxide removal and passivation. Consequently, the thiolate&#8208;passivated CQDs exhibit a tenfold decrease in trap state density compared to controls and remain structurally and optically stable for 5 months. We demonstrate InSb CQD SWIR photodetectors that realize a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28% at 1450&#160;nm, with the highest operating stability among reported CQD SWIR photodetectors, retaining 95% of performance following 300&#160;h of biased and illuminated operation.

         <title>Development of an Organoautocatalyzed Double &#963;&#8208;Bond C(sp2)&#8208;N Transamination Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of cyclic tertiary amines is disclosed as a high&#8208;yielding, scalable reaction that proceeds under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions. It operates via a multi&#8208;step domino reaction mechanism, where an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt functions as a HBD organoautocatalyst. The reaction opens the door for the efficient synthesis of novel N&#8208;substituted DNDHPs of interest in both life and materials sciences.








Abstract
The transamination reaction, which involves the conversion of one amine to another, traditionally relies on biological enzyme catalysts. Although chemists have recently developed a few transition metal&#8208;catalyzed methods, mimicking these enzymes to interconvert amine groups in acyclic substrates via transamination metathesis of a single C(sp2)&#9472;N bond, transamination of cyclic tertiary amines has remained a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we present the development of organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of two C(sp2)&#9472;N bonds in a cyclic substrate that allows for the challenging transformation to take place with up to 95% yield under exceptionally mild reaction conditions at room temperature without external catalysts and/or additives. The reaction mechanism has been studied in detail through time&#8208;resolved 1H&#8208;NMR, 2D NMR, and computational methods. Remarkably, in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt acts as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) organoautocatalyst in this multi&#8208;step domino process. The new organoautocatalyzed methodology gives environmentally friendly, atom&#8208;economical, straightforward, and rapid access to N&#8208;substituted 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DNDHPs), thus offering facile entry to privileged bioactive compounds.

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted esters with aryl bromides is established for the first time by employing P&#8208;chiral monophosphorus ligand 3&#8208;Pent&#8208;BIDIME as a chiral ligand, leading to a series of enantioenriched &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl esters possessing quaternary carbon stereocenters in moderate to good yields and high enantioselectivities. The method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions, excellent functional group compatibility, and low Pd loadings (as low as 1&#160;mol%). Its synthetic utilities are exemplified by the efficient preparation of a chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl substituted &#947;&#8208;lactone and the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;amolanone.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Activation of C&#9472;H Bond in Toluene by Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Supported Subnanometric PtOx Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrocatalytic activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in hydrocarbon molecules to produce valuable oxygenates still suffers from the limited generation of reactive species and the weak adsorption of reactants. This study achieved the selective oxidation of toluene using a TiO2 supported subnanometric PtOx cluster (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode via an electrophilic OH*&#8208;mediated pathway. The modification of PtOx cluster can facilitate toluene adsorption and OH* generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a subnanometric PtOx cluster&#8208;loaded TiO2 (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4&#8208;fold higher than that of pristine TiO2. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate a self&#8208;powered PEC tandem device with S&#8208;shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of &#8764;170&#160;&#181;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtOx/TiO2 photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)&#8208;mediated pathway, which can suppress the over&#8208;oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that subnanometric PtOx clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue toward the activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.

&lt;p&gt;Selective oxidation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a subnanometric PtO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; cluster-loaded TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PtO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75&#160;&#181;mol cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt; with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4-fold higher than that of pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricate a self-powered PEC tandem device with S-shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of &#8764;170&#160;&#181;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)-mediated pathway, which can suppress the over-oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that subnanometric PtO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue toward the activation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of Photoluminescence of BODIHY Dye Using Water&#8208;Soluble Coordination Cages With Different Shapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence of Boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) (G1) dye was effectively controlled through confinement within coordination cages of different shapes. The encapsulation of G1 within a double&#8208;square cage (MC1) resulted in a highly emissive solution, whereas similar confinement within an octahedral cage (MC2) exhibited a weak emission. Moreover, we achieved turn&#8208;on emission of G1 through the displacement of G1 from MC2 to MC1.








Abstract
The confinement of guest molecules within supramolecular hosts can alter their photophysical properties. However, the shapes of the hosts in regulating the guest's emission remains underexplored. Herein, we investigate how the shape of the host alters the emission behavior of boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) (G1) dye encapsulated within two iso&#8208;stoichiometric water&#8208;soluble coordination cages: MC1 (double&#8208;square cage) and MC2 (octahedral cage). Encapsulation of G1 within MC1 results in a highly emissive solution, whereas similar confinement in MC2 leads to a non&#8208;emissive host&#8211;guest solution. A similar trend was observed with different sets of iso&#8208;stoichiometric cages MC3 (double&#8208;square cage) and MC4 (octahedral cage). Using a combination of femtosecond transient absorption and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we observed that the disparity in fluorescence behavior of BODIHY is attributed to charge transfer interactions between the guest and ligand panels of cages. The shape of the coordination cage dictates the preorganization of the guest within the cavity, thereby suppressing or promoting this charge transfer interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate a turn&#8208;on emission of BODIHY dye due to its preferential binding to a double&#8208;square cage. These findings provide fundamental insights into host&#8208;mediated modulation of the guest's photophysics and offer a blueprint for designing supramolecular systems with tunable emissive behavior.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets for the Assembly of Efficient Membrane Bioreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly method to trap enzymes between covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets instead for the construction of membrane bioreactors. This design boosts mass transfer, shields enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products, and enables rapid substrate conversion (complete in 7.95 s)&#8212;achieving 1018&#215; higher activity than free enzymes. The reactor maintains stability under continuous use and works with diverse enzymes/COFs, offering a versatile platform for high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.








Abstract
Immobilizing fragile enzymes in porous materials holds significant potential for biocatalysis but encounters challenges such as mismatched enzyme size and pore structure of host materials, along with harsh assembly conditions that can denature enzymes. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for constructing membrane bioreactors through water&#8208;mediated, vacuum&#8208;assisted layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets with enzymes. This method effectively addresses pore size limitations, preserves enzyme activity, and promotes convective transport of reactants to active sites, while shielding enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products through rapid transport in continuous membrane catalysis. The optimized bioreactor achieves a 1018&#8208;fold increase in relative activity compared to free enzymes in batch reactions, completing substrate conversion in just 7.95 s, and demonstrating enhanced stability.

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;Energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material descriptors are first proposed to guide the design and screening of high&#8208;energy density p&#8208;type organic cathode materials. Triphenylamine and synthesized p&#8208;PZA POP proved the rationality of these descriptors. Na||p&#8208;PZA POP batteries exhibit a surprisingly high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50&#160;&#176;C (166.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1) to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (141.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.

         <title>Bromide as Noninnocent Ligand to Iron Tames Fenton Chemistry for Chemoselective Nondegrading Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time that the bromide ion, acting as a non&#8208;N&#8208;ligand in iron complexes with the tridentate N&#8208;ligand bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BMPA), which is traditionally used in Fenton chemistry to degrade organic compounds, tames Fenton chemistry and enables chemo&#8208;selective, nondegrading oxidation reactions. This discovery of the bromide effect bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation, potentially inspiring further investigation into the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligands of iron complexes for new reactivity and applications. The overlooked inorganic anion may be exploited in other catalytic systems.








Abstract
It has long been the chemistry dogma that the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand of iron complexes determines the redox reactivity; tetra&#8208; and/or pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;based ligand (N&#8208;ligand: PDP, porphyrin, N4Py) enables chemo&#8208;selective oxidation through high&#8208;valent iron species (FeIV/V&#9552;O), while bi&#8208; and/or tridentate N&#8208;ligand leads to the generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e., hydroxyl radical) via a Fenton chemistry pathway. The effect of inorganic anionic ligands (i.e., halides, pseudohalides, triflate, nitrate, sulfate, etc) of these iron complexes has rarely been examined and overlooked as an &#8220;innocent&#8221; anion.

     alt="Bromide as Noninnocent Ligand to Iron Tames Fenton Chemistry for Chemoselective Nondegrading Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report for the first time that the bromide ion, acting as a non-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ligand in iron complexes with the tridentate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ligand bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (BMPA), which is traditionally used in Fenton chemistry to degrade organic compounds, tames Fenton chemistry and enables chemo-selective, nondegrading oxidation reactions. This discovery of the bromide effect bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase-catalyzed halogenation, potentially inspiring further investigation into the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligands of iron complexes for new reactivity and applications. The &lt;b&gt;overlooked&lt;/b&gt; inorganic anion may be exploited in other catalytic systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been the chemistry dogma that the nitrogen-based ligand of iron complexes determines the redox reactivity; tetra- and/or pentadentate nitrogen-based ligand (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ligand: PDP, porphyrin, N4Py) enables chemo-selective oxidation through high-valent iron species (Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV/V&lt;/sup&gt;&#9552;O), while bi- and/or tridentate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ligand leads to the generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e., hydroxyl radical) via a Fenton chemistry pathway. The effect of inorganic anionic ligands (i.e., halides, pseudohalides, triflate, nitrate, sulfate, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;) of these iron complexes has rarely been examined and overlooked as an &#8220;innocent&#8221; anion. Herein, we report our discovery that bromide (Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) is not an innocent ligand to the iron-BPMA complexes [BMPA: bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine] but a decisive factor for taming the Fenton chemistry (ROS) into a mild [HOBr] oxidant, which allows for chemo- and regioselective oxidation of furans, indoles, and sulfides without noticeable degradation. In contrast to the conventional Fenton chemistry pathway by many tridentate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ligand iron complexes, our [Fe(BMPA)Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] mimics haloperoxidases to generate HOBr by oxidation of bromide ion with hydrogen peroxide. The discovery of the bromide effect on iron complexes bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase-catalyzed halogenation and might stimulate interest in reinvestigating the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligand of iron complexes for discovery of new reactivity and new applications.

         <title>Evoking Simultaneous Ferroptosis and Apoptosis by a Dual&#8208;Locked Platinum (IV) Prodrug for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

A dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug combines a TLR7/8 agonist (IMDQ) with a GGT&#8208;responsive moiety. Reduction to Pt(II) triggers GGT&#8208;mediated cleavage of axial ligands, releasing IMDQ to activate immunity. TLR7/8 signaling boosts T&#8208;cell infiltration into tumors and stimulates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs). Synergy between platinum chemotherapy and immune activation achieves potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
While platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, their clinical potential is limited by off&#8208;target toxicity and restricted antitumor mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug designed for tumor&#8208;specific activation, combining platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy with TLR7/8&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. The prodrug features a &#947;&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;caged TLR7/8 agonist as an axial ligand, enabling sequential activation by elevated glutathione (GSH) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in the tumor microenvironment. Reduction of the Pt(IV) core releases cisplatin and depletes intracellular reductants, amplifying reactive oxygen species to trigger synergistic ferroptosis and apoptosis. Concurrently, GGT&#8208;cleaved axial ligand activates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells, repolarizing immunosuppressive M2&#8208;like macrophages to pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;like phenotypes while recruiting effector and memory T cells. In murine models, the Pt(IV) prodrug demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy by confining immune activation to malignant tissues, eradicating primary tumors, and establishing durable protective immunity against recurrence. This spatiotemporally controlled dual&#8208;release strategy minimizes systemic toxicity while synergizing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, offering a transformative approach for targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Synthesis and Modification of Formate Zr&#8208;MOF (ZrFA) Toward Scalable and Cost&#8208;Cutting Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol was developed to scale up ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs with simple formate, enabling one&#8208;step direct separation of C2H4 from the binary C2H2/C2H4 or ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 gas mixtures with high separation efficiency and cost&#8208;saving preparation.








Abstract
The mass production of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with affordable cost is highly demanding yet limited for commercial applications, e.g., purification of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) via acetylene (C2H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal faces the challenge of developing low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale physisorbents with efficiency and recyclability. Herein, we developed a viable synthetic protocol to scale&#8208;up a series of ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs (ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I)) with the simplest monocarboxylate, formate (FA), through consecutive production by recycling solvent/modulator. Besides a size&#8208;exclusion effect disfavoring C2H4 adsorption, introduction of defective and Cu(I) sites was found to enhance gas affinity and uptake capacity. A comprehensive evaluation of C2H4 separation and economic efficiency has been proposed, suggesting the improvement of C2H2 uptake capacity is effective for the binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, while the separation process of the ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures depends on subtle tradeoff of complex factors and limited by challenging CO2/C2H4 separating. Notably, the large&#8208;scale separation has been testified to significantly improve separation efficiency, and the low&#8208;cost preparation benefits high economic efficiency. The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF&#8208;syntheses toward low&#8208;cost, scale&#8208;up, and recyclable production.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries Enable Selective Urea Production From Simulated Flue Gas in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>

The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8315; presents a promising route for sustainable urea production. Here, we show that in situ generated CO2 bubbles within a bi(carbonate) reduction zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer can boost urea selectivity by engendering a high density of triple&#8208;phase boundaries.








Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;powered co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; offers a promising pathway toward sustainable urea production. However, achieving high urea selectivity is challenging due to substantial competing side reactions. Here, we show that engendering a high density of CO2 bubbles on the catalyst surface creates numerous triple&#8208;phase boundaries that are key toward enhancing CO2 versus NO3&#8722; availability for selective urea production. We implemented this strategy using a bipolar membrane in a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, which allows for the in situ conversion of (bi)carbonate to CO2 bubbles at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. Notably, we demonstrate that this electrolyzer system can utilize simulated flue gas (20% CO2&#160;+&#160;5% O2) for urea production. With a Cu95Ru5 catalyst, we achieve a urea Faradaic efficiency of 58% at 2&#160;V full&#8208;cell voltage over an extended 30&#8208;h period and a peak production rate of 35.46&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat&#8722;1. Under these conditions, the Faradaic efficiency to hydrogen evolution and nitrate reduction are 14.7% and 21.6%, respectively. Strikingly, these results with simulated flue gas are comparable to previously reported systems that employ pure CO2. Our results introduce a simple yet effective design approach toward developing efficient electrolyzer systems for urea production.

         <title>Activating Surface Oxygen in Ce/Mo&#8208;Doped Ni Oxyhydroxide for Synergistically Enhancing Furfural Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mo/Ce co&#8208;doped Ni oxyhydroxide was prepared for the electrochemical oxidation of furfural coupled with hydrogen evolution. Mo promotes the adsorption of furfural while Ce promotes the formation of OOH, and the synergistic effect of Ce and Mo leads to an industrial current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at only 1.46&#160;V versus RHE.








Abstract
The integration of biomass&#8208;platform molecule oxidation with water electrolysis is a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production and obtain high&#8208;value chemicals simultaneously, yet the efficiency of organic oxidation requires further improvement. Herein, we developed a highly efficient Ce, Mo co&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, where Mo with high spin state promotes the adsorption of furfural (FA), while Ce activates surface lattice oxygen (OL), lowering the energy barrier for OL&#9472;OH coupling to form OOH, the key intermediate for high current densities. The catalyst achieves an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low potential of 1.46&#160;V versus RHE in furfural oxidation, with exceptional selectivity (99.4%) and Faradaic efficiency (97.7%) for furoic acid. When deployed as anode in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane reactor, the NiMoCe/NF catalyst sustains a current density of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of only 1.85 and 2.15&#160;V, respectively, surpassing most reported continuous flow electrolyzers limited to 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the system exhibits outstanding durability after 200&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides critical insights into the rational design of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization coupled with industrial hydrogen production.

         <title>Interweaving Covalent Organic Polymer Chains Into Two&#8208;Dimensional Networks: Synthesis, Single Crystal Structure, and Application for Stabilizing Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A woven two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic polymer network (CityU&#8208;46) was designed, fabricated, and structurally resolved through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which revealed a unique, well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over, two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. CityU&#8208;46, serving as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance in practical lithium metal cells.








Abstract
Macroscopic weaving has been proven to be the most enduring and effective method for manufacturing fabrics to meet the practical needs of humanity for thousands of years. However, the construction of molecular structures with exquisite topologies and specific properties based on molecular weaving is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed and fabricated a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) woven covalent organic polymer (COP) network (named as CityU&#8208;46) driven by the dative N&#8594;B bonds between the 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxa&#8208;borole)benzene (BACT) and 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (BPT). The complex woven topology of CityU&#8208;46 was determined using a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, revealing that it features a well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over and two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. Due to its structural merits, CityU&#8208;46 can be used as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, significantly improving the stability and long&#8208;term performance of lithium metal cells.

         <title>Nucleophilic Germylation of Stable &#960; Bonds via Ge&#9472;Ge Bond Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamically controlled nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds was achieved by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology enables unprecedented multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes, affording 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes.








Abstract
Organogermanes have recently attracted a great deal of attention as building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive products, drugs, and functional materials. Metallo&#8208;germyls were classically synthesized and employed for nucleophilic germylation to form C&#9472;Ge bonds. However, their syntheses require highly reactive organometal reagents, and the scope of germylations involving metallo&#8208;germyls is limited due to competition with kinetically favored side reactions. Here, we present a regio/stereo&#8208;convergent nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond of digermane (Ge&#9472;Ge) in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology affords unprecedented reactivity, enabling multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes. These reactions are operationally simple, have broad functional group tolerance, and afford densely functionalized aliphatic organogermanes, such as 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes, without any catalyst.

         <title>p&#8211;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of halogenated COF nanoemitters via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The introduction of halogen atoms facilitates p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within COF skeleton, leading to a 49&#8208;fold ECL enhancement compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8211;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8211;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Mechanosensitive Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Visualizing Temporal Changes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>

Mechanosensitive conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) with integrated twistable bonds enable real&#8208;time imaging of membrane tension in lipid bilayers. Using fluorescence lifetime analysis, COE&#8208;BY probes reveal vesicle rigidity changes during endocytosis, providing insights into membrane mechanics at the subcellular level.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;spanning molecules that serve as fluorescent dyes for bioimaging. However, COE emission has thus far only been capable of visualizing dye location and their preferential accumulation in different membrane&#8208;bound intracellular compartments. Herein, we report the first example of environmentally sensitive COEs for visualizing temporal changes in live cells, providing information on the physical properties of intracellular lipid bilayer membranes. The new COE&#8208;BY series is designed around a BODIPY central unit with a membrane&#8208;spanning topology and six cationic pendant groups ensuring solubility in aqueous media. These reporters feature high two&#8208;photon absorption cross section, NIR&#8208;II excitation capabilities under multiphoton excitation, and high dye brightness; all highly desirable photophysical features for bioimaging. The emission lifetime of the probes was sensitive to changes to both the lipid composition of model vesicle systems and membrane tension within cells, induced by either mechanical or osmotic stress. Using two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it is possible to use the most efficient emitter, namely, COE&#8208;BYPhOC4, to image changes in the mechanical properties of intracellular membranes. We show that these COEs remain stably vesicle&#8208;bound within the endolysosomal pathway over extended periods, allowing for long&#8208;term monitoring of the associated biophysical changes of these vesicles over time.

         <title>Enantioselective Decarboxylative Acylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids with Carboxylic Acids via Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives with carboxylic acids has been developed, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as a pivotal platform for constructing C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, using two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids as a feedstock to form chiral &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones remains a considerable challenge due to side reactions such as decarboxylative reduction and homocoupling. Herein, we report for the first time a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives and aliphatic carboxylic acids, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% e.e.). The advantage of this reaction is that it eliminates the need for metal reductants and the use of precious metal photocatalysts and utilizes renewable feedstocks. The use of a coiled&#8208;tube continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor can shorten the illumination time by half and obtain results comparable to those of a batch reaction. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments support a pathway in which photocatalytic decarboxylation generates &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl radical species, and the Ni(I)&#8211;alkyl intermediate activates the in situ&#8211;formed mixed anhydride followed by reductive elimination to give the product in enantiomerically pure form.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind UV Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve solar&#8208;blind UV mechanoluminescent (ML) materials through strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode. DPO3C and DPO4C exhibited solar&#8208;blind UV emission with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm, with wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions from 293 to 741&#160;nm via host&#8211;guest doping. This study also paves the way for advancements in bright&#8208;field stress visualization.








Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 to 741&#160;nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.

         <title>Harnessing Negative Photochromism in Styryl Cyanines for Light&#8208;Modulated Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show how photo switchable styryl cyanines undergo an extremely efficient photochemical ring&#8208;closing reaction upon irradiation. Furthermore, substituents on the ring and the nature of their surroundings can be used to tune their chemistry, kinetics, and photochemical properties. Finally, we demonstrate how these molecules can be used as smart dopants to control proton transport using light in a polymeric matrix.








Abstract
Efficient photoswitches capable of complete conversion to their metastable isomer are not so common, yet highly desirable for applications in smart materials and devices. Here, we report the photochromic behavior of a series of styryl cyanine photoswitches, all demonstrating high switching efficiency, with some achieving full conversion to the metastable form. Despite structural similarities to spiropyran photoswitches, we demonstrate that the photochemistry of styryl cyanines is fundamentally different. Unlike classical photoswitches that rely on double&#8208;bond rotation, these molecules undergo substantial geometric changes via the formation of a spiro carbon. This transformation disrupts conjugation, causing a desirable blue shift in absorbance ideal for creating responsive materials and devices. We further show that the switching kinetics can be finely tuned through electronic effects of various substituents or the choice of surrounding medium. These photoswitches exhibit excellent fatigue resistance and can be easily shifted into the visible region via their acidochromic properties. Taking advantage of their high switching efficiency and affinity for acidic polymers, we finally propose their use as smart dopants to develop light&#8208;responsive materials with tunable proton transport properties under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Beyond Second Coordination Shell: Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8208;Electrons Delocalization Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) depend on hierarchical coordination environments, yet higher&#8208;order shells (&gt;2nd) critically influence electronic structures via long&#8208;range charge delocalization. This study pioneers long&#8208;range interaction engineering in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for CO2 electroreduction. By tailoring pyrolysis of NiTPP to preserve Ni&#8208;N4 coordination shell (first and second) while eliminating peripheral &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the catalyst achieves a 29&#8208;fold CO efficiency boost (85.9% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V) and 98.3% selectivity at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although long&#8208;range charge delocalization beyond the second coordination shell critically influence the geometric and electronic properties of single&#8208;atom active sites, their systematic modulation to enhance multielectron catalytic processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a site&#8208;specific strategy to engineer the nickel tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) precursors by selectively cleaving carbon&#8211;carbon single bonds at the &#946;&#8208;carbon sites. This approach preserves the Ni&#8208;centered first and second coordination shells while systematically removing peripheral &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in extended coordination environments. The resultant Ni&#8208;N4 catalyst exhibits a 29&#8208;fold enhancement in CO faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.4&#160;V versus RHE compared to original counterparts. Notably, it maintains 98.3% CO selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities up to 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the electron&#8208;enriched Ni sites, arising from precisely regulated charge delocalization in higher coordination shells, facilitate stabilization of the critical *COOH intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) depend on hierarchical coordination environments, yet higher-order shells (&amp;gt;2nd) critically influence electronic structures via long-range charge delocalization. This study pioneers long-range interaction engineering in single-atom catalysts (SACs) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. By tailoring pyrolysis of NiTPP to preserve Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordination shell (first and second) while eliminating peripheral &#960;-delocalization, the catalyst achieves a 29-fold CO efficiency boost (85.9% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V) and 98.3% selectivity at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although long-range charge delocalization beyond the second coordination shell critically influence the geometric and electronic properties of single-atom active sites, their systematic modulation to enhance multielectron catalytic processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a site-specific strategy to engineer the nickel tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) precursors by selectively cleaving carbon&#8211;carbon single bonds at the &#946;-carbon sites. This approach preserves the Ni-centered first and second coordination shells while systematically removing peripheral &#960;-electron delocalization in extended coordination environments. The resultant Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits a 29-fold enhancement in CO faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.4&#160;V versus RHE compared to original counterparts. Notably, it maintains 98.3% CO selectivity at industrial-grade current densities up to 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cell. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the electron-enriched Ni sites, arising from precisely regulated charge delocalization in higher coordination shells, facilitate stabilization of the critical *COOH intermediate. Our findings establish a paradigm for advanced catalyst design through deliberate engineering of higher coordination shells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Asymmetric Molecular Engineering Enables Regioregular Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor with High Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;low Energy Loss in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The synergistic strategies of the double asymmetric core and symmetric/asymmetric terminal engineering are applied to develop multiple&#8208;asymmetric acceptors. By delicately tuning the number and position of peripheral F and Cl atoms, the regioregular triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary OSCs yield the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.32% and ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) among selenium&#8208;substituted acceptors. 








Abstract
Asymmetric molecular engineering is utilized for developing efficient small molecular acceptors (SMAs), whereas adopting multiple asymmetric strategies at the terminals, side chains, and cores of efficient SMAs remains a challenge, and effects on reducing energy loss (Eloss) have been rarely investigation. Herein, four regioregular multiple&#8208;asymmetric SMAs (DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, TASe&#8208;2Cl2F, and TASe&#8208;2F2Cl) are constructed by delicately manipulating the number and position of F and Cl on end groups. Triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl not only exhibits a unique and most compact 3D network crystal stacking structure but also possesses excellent crystallinity and electron mobility in neat film. Surprisingly, the PM1:TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary organic solar cells (OSCs) yield a champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.32%, surpassing the PCE of 18.27%, 17.25%, and 16.30% for DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, and TASe&#8208;2Cl2F&#8208;based devices, which attributed to the optimized blend morphology with proper phase separation and more ordered intermolecular stacking and excellent charge transport. Notably, the champion PCE of 19.32% with ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) of 0.179&#160;eV marks a record&#8208;breaking result for selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our innovative multiple&#8208;asymmetric molecular engineering of precisely modulating the number and position of fluorinated/chlorinated end groups is an effective strategy for obtaining highly&#8208;efficient and minimal &#916;E3 of selenium&#8208;substituted SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs simultaneously.

         <title>Stereocontrol in Conformationally Stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) Atropisomers</title>

         <dc:description>
Building in our expertize in the synthesis of trans&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans via organocatalyzed domino Michael/O&#8208;cyclization between &#946;&#8208;naphthols and nitroalkenes, we developed an efficient strategy to access a new family of atropisomers bearing a conformationally stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and two stereogenic centers through simple and highly diastereoselective alkylation of dihydrofurans with structurally diverse electrophiles. This crucial step places the nitro group in a relative cis&#8208;configuration with respect to the aromatic moiety, effectively increasing the barrier to diastereomerization and stabilizing the molecular conformation.








Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step sequence for the enantioselective construction of a rare family of stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) atropisomers featuring two additional stereogenic centers. The process begins with an organocatalyzed dihydrobenzofurannulation that establishes and controls the stereochemistry of two carbon centers, followed by a highly diastereoselective functionalization that significantly enhances the barrier to diastereomerization of the C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond, effectively locking and stabilizing its configuration.

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with lithiophilic sites and hydrogen bond interaction with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) can accelerate the desolvation process of lithium ion and guide the rapid and uniform deposition of Li+.








Abstract
Effectively managing Li+ migration behaviors and addressing the issues of side reactions at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface is crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work introduces a two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding and lithiophilic sites for the first time to tailor the electronic structure and solvation chemistry in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) based electrolyte and stabilize the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) interface. Initially, the abundant lithiophilic sites (C&#9552;O, C&#9552;N) in the HOF coordinate with Li+, acting as key electron donors to optimize the electronic structure while also reducing the desolvation energy barrier when Li+ dissociates from the solvent sheath. Moreover, the multifunctional hydrogen bonding not only acts as the &#8220;appended manipulator&#8221; to anchor &#8208;NH2 to LiTFSI and reduces the adverse reactions at the LMAs interface but also mitigates the mechanical stress during lithium deposition. As evidenced by various in/ex situ characterizations, the HOF&#8208;modified lithium&#8208;metal symmetric batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycling performance (11&#160;000&#160;h) and low voltage fluctuations at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This unique strategy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded synergistic lithiophilic sites provides a new perspective on the design of artificial interfacial layers for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Thioamides Adjacent to the Ionizable Amine Headgroup in Ionizable Lipids Reduce the pKa of Lipid Nanoparticles and Enhance mRNA Transfection Efficiency in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing an ionizable lipid with a thioamide adjacent to the tertiary amine have a lower pKa than those containing an analogous lipid with a conventional amide, and exhibit significantly improved mRNA transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery vectors. However, optimizing LNPs for in vivo applications remains largely empirical. The apparent pKa of LNPs is a predictive factor for in vivo performance, with pKa values between 6 and 7 showing the highest efficacy. Despite this critical role of ionizable lipids in LNPs, the relationship between lipid structure and its influence on LNP pKa remains poorly studied. In this study, we report the design and the synthesis of a novel class of ionizable lipids featuring a thioamide moiety, enabling direct comparison between thioamide&#8208;containing (SAM) LNPs and amide&#8208;containing (OAM) LNPs. We find that substituting oxygen with sulfur in the amide group significantly decreases the apparent pKa of LNPs, increasing the likelihood of identifying lipids in combinatorial libraries that yield LNPs with a pKa in the desired 6&#8211;7 range. The reduction in pKa in LNPs containing SAM lipids, compared with OAM lipids, is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the thioamide group. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple libraries of SAM lipids and varying the ionizable head group, alkyl chains, and linker length, we discovered thioamide lipids with distinct tissue tropism, including lipids that mediate splenic targeting by LNPs.

     alt="Thioamides Adjacent to the Ionizable Amine Headgroup in Ionizable Lipids Reduce the pKa of Lipid Nanoparticles and Enhance mRNA Transfection Efficiency in Vitro and in Vivo"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing an ionizable lipid with a thioamide adjacent to the tertiary amine have a lower p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than those containing an analogous lipid with a conventional amide, and exhibit significantly improved mRNA transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery vectors. However, optimizing LNPs for in vivo applications remains largely empirical. The apparent p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;a of LNPs is a predictive factor for in vivo performance, with p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values between 6 and 7 showing the highest efficacy. Despite this critical role of ionizable lipids in LNPs, the relationship between lipid structure and its influence on LNP p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; remains poorly studied. In this study, we report the design and the synthesis of a novel class of ionizable lipids featuring a thioamide moiety, enabling direct comparison between thioamide-containing (SAM) LNPs and amide-containing (OAM) LNPs. We find that substituting oxygen with sulfur in the amide group significantly decreases the apparent p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of LNPs, increasing the likelihood of identifying lipids in combinatorial libraries that yield LNPs with a p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; in the desired 6&#8211;7 range. The reduction in p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; in LNPs containing SAM lipids, compared with OAM lipids, is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the thioamide group. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple libraries of SAM lipids and varying the ionizable head group, alkyl chains, and linker length, we discovered thioamide lipids with distinct tissue tropism, including lipids that mediate splenic targeting by LNPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulated Second&#8208;sphere Coordination in Amorphous Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy is employed by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU), with efforts to trigger more orbital interactions with guest molecules. Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is chosen to transform rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. Such architecture with clear and unique second&#8208;sphere interaction can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecule and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation.








Abstract
The endeavor toward photocatalytic CO2 fixation is largely hampered by the rigid spatial configurations and inadequate orbital overlap between the catalytic site and CO2. Herein, we propose a second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU). Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is constructed as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to achieve creative control over the second coordination sphere. Such architecture transforms rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. This shift can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecules and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation. Both in situ experiments and theoretical calculations verify second&#8208;sphere engineering endows the Lewis base sites with high electron donating capacity and promotes the electron injection into the &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals of the CO2 molecule effectively. Hence, the a&#8208;MOF displays approximately double the yield in various photocatalytic CO2 reactions compared with its crystalline counterpart. Moreover, its photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;CO2 battery delivers higher discharging voltage and a fourfold increment of discharge capacity at 200&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2. The unique ability to tailor the secondary coordination sphere performs attractive merits governing the small molecule binding affinity, aiming to manipulate the local microenvironment of open metal sites for efficient CO2 fixation.

         <title>Unlocking One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Metalloid Boron&#8208;Modified Zn3In2S6 for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is engineered, featuring In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites that establish dual&#8208;channel carrier transfer pathways and substantially prolong photogenerated carrier lifetimes five&#8208;fold. These synergistic effects enable direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR for efficient H2O2 production from O2 in pure water, achieving a record apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm among inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts.








Abstract
The indirect two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) dominates photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis but suffers from sluggish kinetics, &#8226;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced catalyst degradation, and spatiotemporal carrier&#8208;intermediate mismatch. Herein, we pioneer a metal&#8208;metalloid dual&#8208;site strategy to unlock the direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR pathway, demonstrated through boron&#8208;engineered Zn3In2S6 (B&#8208;ZnInS) photocatalyst with In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites. The In&#8208;B dual&#8208;site configuration creates a charge&#8208;balanced electron reservoir by charge complementation, which achieves moderate O2 adsorption via bidentate coordination and dual&#8208;channel electron transfer, preventing excessive O&#9472;O bond activation. Simultaneously, boron doping induces lattice polarization to establish a built&#8208;in electric field, quintupling photogenerated carrier lifetimes versus pristine ZnInS. These synergies redirect the O2 activation pathway from indirect to direct 2e&#8722; ORR process, delivering an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3121&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2)&#8212;an 11&#8208;fold enhancement over ZnInS. The system achieves an unprecedented apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm for H2O2 photosynthesis among inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts, and can continuously produce medical&#8208;grade H2O2 (3&#160;wt%). This work provides insights for designing efficient H2O2 photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation with Low&#8208;Valent Strontium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although computationally predicted, N2 activation with an in situ generated low&#8208;valent &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) SrI precursor did not result in a stable complex. First dinitrogen fixation with Sr was achieved using a heterobimetallic approach. This highly reducing product vigorously reacts with Teflon.








Abstract
DFT calculations on &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#9472;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. However, isolation of (BDI)Sr(&#956;&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#8722; dianion should thermodynamically be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the super bulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(Me)C&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). First, N2 fixation with a Sr complex was enabled by a heterobimetallic approach. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with potassium gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); DIPePNN&#160;=&#160;DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. A similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#8722; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.

Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(&lt;sup&gt;DIPeP&lt;/sup&gt;NN)SrKF]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (&lt;sup&gt;DIPeP&lt;/sup&gt;NN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;-Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon-soluble reducing agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective CO Electroreduction to Multicarbon Oxygenates Over Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag Sites in Alkaline Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the *OH cleavage of *COCOH toward *COO, thereby enhancing the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CO electroreduction. CO electrolysis over the optimized CuAg catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at a current density of 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2 in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to produce multicarbon (C2+) oxygenates using renewable electricity is a promising carbon utilization pathway. However, the performance of this process suffers from low C2+ oxygenates selectivity and insufficient current density. Here, we employed a Cu&#8211;Ag bimetallic strategy to enhance the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CORR in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer at ampere&#8208;level current densities. The Cu&#8211;Ag catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering feature atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface, which are key to promoting the formation of C2+ oxygenates. Increasing Ag content favors C2+ oxygenates formation while inhibiting ethylene production. The optimized Cu2Ag catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the dissociation of *COCOH to *CCO, thus favoring C2+ oxygenates formation.

         <title>Valence Tautomerism and Alkaline Properties of Global Aromatic Imine&#8208; and Methine&#8208;Bridged all&#8208;Benzenoid Macrocyclic Superpyrazine and Supertriazine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared two imine macrocycles, SPAZ and STAZ, as analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. SPAZ and STAZ exhibit Br&#248;nsted basicity with pKa values of 0.97 and 3.27, respectively. Notably, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, facilitated by aza[30]annulene pathways.








Abstract
The comprehensive understanding of the ground&#8208;state electronic structures of all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles and their charged species, particularly those exhibiting global (anti)aromaticity, remains poorly resolved. Here, we present two imine&#8208; and methine&#8208;bridged all&#8208;benzenoid [6]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenes SPAZ (superpyrazine) and STAZ (supertriazine)&#8208;designed as &#960;&#8208;extended analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. For the first time, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; alternating benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, mediated by a 30&#960; azaannulene conjugated pathway. The aromatic stabilization energy of global aromatic delocalization would partially counterbalance the energy penalty for disrupting three benzenoid sextets. Further protonation studies demonstrate their alkaline characteristics (pKa&#160;=&#160;0.97 for SPAZ; 3.27 for STAZ), with diprotonated SPAZ&#8208;DH and monoprotonated STAZ&#8208;MH adopting planarized geometries that amplify global aromaticity through charge&#8208;induced structural constraints and enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. Notably, two&#8208;electron reduction generates a dianion SPAZ&#8208;DA exhibiting 32&#960; electron global antiaromaticity with amine N atom embedded aza[30]annulene pathway. These findings establish a framework for decoding electronic structure property relationships in all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles, offering insights into aromaticity modulated regulations through tautomerism, protonation, and redox switching.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#946;&#8208;Selective Hydroamination of Enamides for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal enamides were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to achieve unconventional &#946;&#8208;regioselectivity with up to 99% ee. This coordination assistance strategy creates an efficient pathway for synthesizing valuable enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;diamine derivatives.








Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;rich alkenes has been developed. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center effectively overrides the inherent electronic preference of N&#9472;H addition to an enamide, delivering unconventional &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Phthalimide is utilized as a readily removable amination agent. This methodology enables direct access to enantio&#8208;enriched 1,2&#8208;diamines from readily available materials with 100% atom economy, exclusive regioselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee).

         <title>Design of Intrinsically Stable Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Introducing Fused&#8208;Ring Intramolecular Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a novel SAM molecular design strategy by introducing fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions. The designed molecule, JJ32, features a benzo[5,6][1,4]thiazino[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline skeleton, where strong D&#8211;A interactions enhance charge delocalization and downshift the LUMO energy level. This leads to enhanced photostability, redox stability, and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, the improved redox stability benefits the promising polyoxometalate/SAM composite HSL, allowing the JJ32/HPWO&#8208;based OSC to reach 19.85% efficiency with improved stability.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) incorporating electron&#8208;donating conjugated units as head groups have witnessed remarkable success in helping achieve high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these molecules frequently exhibit a shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, rendering them prone to photodegradation.&#160;To tackle this problem, we introduce fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions into the design of SAM molecules to downshift the LUMO level. The resultant molecule, JJ32, shows both enhanced photostability and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the fused&#8208;ring intramolecular D&#8211;A interactions also help stabilize the radical cation state of JJ32 to result in significantly improved redox stability. This enables them to be included in polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based composite hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs), resulting in an impressive efficiency of 19.85% alongside significantly enhanced stability in corresponding OSCs. This study not only validates the concept of using fused&#8208;ring D&#8211;A&#8208;structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

This study not only validates the concept of using fused-ring D&#8211;A-structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;Coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets has been successfully developed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. The isolated Mo sites optimize the driving force of photogenerated holes, which greatly accelerates the electron transfer rate of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;concentration alkyl radicals.








Abstract
Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficient utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develmically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400&#160;nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picoseconds. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#9472;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation.

         <title>Strain Energy Induced Rotary Speed Acceleration in a Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy accelerates rotary speed in overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors by tuning cycloparaphenylene loop size, preserving core structures. Strain energy variations drive hierarchical acceleration up to 389&#8208;fold. This study systematically reveals motor behavior under strain, offering new avenues for engineering light&#8208;driven nanomachines.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors based on overcrowded alkenes represent a major type of molecular machines that are able to rotate unidirectionally. The regulation of the rotary speed without altering the core structure of a motor is crucial and remains a major challenge. In the present study, we reported that the rotary speed of molecular motors can be significantly enhanced by harnessing the strain energy of cycloparaphenylene (CPP). A series of molecular motors incorporated in CPP with varying sizes were synthesized, and their photochemical and thermal isomerization behaviors were meticulously examined using UV&#8211;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The remarkable increase of the acceleration effect of the rotary speed with decreasing macrocycle sizes, up to 389&#8208;fold, can be attributed to the strain energy induced bending in the stator part, which reduces steric hindrance in the &#8220;fjord region&#8221; of the molecule, supported by a detailed computational study employing density functional theory. This work provides systematic insight into the behavior of molecular motors under strain energy, thereby paving the way for the application of motor&#8208;incorporating CPPs as a general strategy to accelerate the rotary speed of molecular motors.

         <title>Tri&#8208;Coordinated Boron Species in Confined Boron Oxide Catalysts for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confined BOx@SiO2 with highly dispersed BOx species was synthesized by the in situ transformation of BN@SiO2, which showed a remarkable activity of a unique C3H8 conversion uprush increasing from 5.3% at 410&#160;&#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The key for the efficient C3H8 activation was the increased amount of tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH derived from the dispersion of molten BOx species within spatially confined SiO2.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward synthesis of confined boron&#8208;based catalysts commonly using H3BO3 is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BOx@SiO2 catalyst showing an impressive low&#8208;temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO2 shell and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron&#8211;oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#9472;O&#9472;Si and hydrogen bonds. BOx@SiO2 exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH (B[3]a and B[3]b) active sites from the dispersion of molten BOx species in confined SiO2. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angles of O&#9472;B&#9472;O and B&#9472;O&#9472;B and system disorder of BOx species increased significantly in molten state, favoring the dispersion of BOx species and formation of B&#9472;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.

         <title>Xanthopinacol Boronate: A Robust, Photochemically Assembled and Cleavable Boronic Ester for Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xanthopinacol (xpin) boronates are a conceptually new class of masked boronic acids designed to alleviate many of the disadvantages of pinacol esters and other popular adducts. They can be formed directly from xanthone and UV light, undergo orthogonal transformations, and are cleavable under photoredox catalysis or oxidative conditions that recycle xanthone to prevent the re&#8208;esterification and facilitate the isolation of the boronic acid.








Abstract
Organoboronic acids impact numerous fields of application from organic synthesis to drug discovery and materials science. However, their highly polar nature makes them challenging to handle, purify, and characterize. Boronic esters help overcome these issues, and pinacol esters (Bpin) have become the dominant boronic acid surrogate in organic synthesis. Despite its popularity, Bpin is not without drawbacks. Its formation from pinacol is intrinsically reversible in the presence of water or alcohols, which may cause premature release leading to losses during reactions and purification. This reversibility complicates the hydrolytic regeneration of free boronic acids, which often requires additional steps to destroy the pinacol by&#8208;product. Although other boronyl protecting groups exist, their removal requires harsh pH conditions. To address these issues, we developed xanthopinacol boronates (Bxpin), a robust protecting group for boronic acids with excellent orthogonality in various chemical reactions and mild irreversible removal under catalyzed photoredox conditions. Xpin boronates can be obtained directly by irradiation of a mixture of free boronic acid and xanthone with UV light, causing an in situ dimerization of xanthone to the required xanthopinacol. The unique attributes of xpin boronates were further studied by UV&#8211;vis spectrophotometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and various stability tests.

         <title>Constructing Ionic Transport Network via Supramolecular Composite Binder in Cathode for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective composite binder strategy is proposed to establish multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels within the LiFePO4 cathode, which significantly improves the Li+ transport efficiency and achieves high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high cathode active loading.








Abstract
Binders play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of electrodes. However, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride binder with low ionic conductivity could not meet the ionic transport requirements of the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a composite binder (PPCL) derived from the cross&#8208;linking of linear molecules and mechanically interlocked molecules with typical supramolecular channel structure is designed. The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8722;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li+ transport channels to achieve stable Li+ transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.

         <title>Construction of Shamrock&#8208;Shaped Giant Molecule Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the highly efficient Qx series of small molecules, we have synthesized T&#8208;Qxs, which are shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecules with high glass transition temperature. The miscibility with the polymer donor PM6 was fine&#8208;tuned by modulation of the central and terminal atoms, thereby altering the molecular distortion angle. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl achieve both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high thermal stability.








Abstract
The discovery of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development into organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecule materials T&#8208;Qx based on high efficiency Qx&#8208;series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted giant molecule T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188 &#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21&#160;eV, which results in a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93&#160;V. T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar molecules.

         <title>Intrinsically Luminescent Nematic Liquid Crystals Enabling High&#8208;Brightness Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Chiral Coassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of luminescent nematic liquid crystals (N&#8208;LCs) exhibiting full&#8208;color emission was developed. Through coassembly with chiral dopants, these N&#8208;LCs enabled the fabrication of high&#8208;brightness full&#8208;color and white circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) films with simultaneously enhanced glum (up to 0.75) and photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 71%), representing the best performance to date among all intrinsically luminescent CPL materials.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with simultaneous high dissymmetry factor (glum) and brightness are pivotal for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs betwwen glum value and photoluminescenc quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we report a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct intrinsically luminescent chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films via coassembly of luminescent liquid crystals (LLCs) and chiral dopant. First, five intrinsic LLCs molecules (2PFQ, 2PFBQ, 2PFB, 2PFSe, and 2PFS) were synthesized by combining the biphenyl framework with dioctyl&#8208;functionalized fluorene, achieving exceptional nematic phases and high brightness with PLQY up to 99%. Then, chiral coassembly of the obtained LLCs with chiral dopants (P/M&#8208;THH) followed by rapid thermal quenching yielded Bragg reflection&#8208;free N*&#8208;LC films exhibiting high&#8208;brightness CPL with recorded glum values (up to 0.75) and PLQY (up to 71%). Full&#8208;color tunability and white CPL (CIE: 0.33, 0.33) were realized through precise compositional control. The simultaneous optimization of glum and PLQY enables high&#8208;brightness CPL with advanced anticounterfeiting capabilities, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;brighness CPL materials for polarized photonic and optoelectronic applications.

         <dc:description>
A direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of unprotected primary amines has been developed using aldehyde/Cu/Ir ternary catalysis. This catalytic system enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Notably, this method establishes a sophisticated asymmetric induction model for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Chiral primary amines are recognized as one of the most valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates, widely utilized in the construction of diverse amine&#8208;containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines is the most straightforward method for creating these motifs. However, this transformation remains underdeveloped, particularly in stereodivergent synthesis of primary amines with multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report an aldehyde/copper/iridium ternary catalytic system, which was successfully employed for the direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of primary &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;chromanone without requiring additional protection or activation of the NH2 group. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters were prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally&#160;&gt;20:1 dr and&#160;&gt;99% ee). Notably, all four stereoisomers of the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines can be readily prepared by simply switching the configuration combinations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the asymmetric induction model for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of primary amines was meticulously elucidated through comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Chloromethylation Modified Pyranonitrile&#8208;Based Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Selective One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;modification strategy employing a chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production of covalent microporous polymers (CMPs). The H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP namely DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl reached 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, which is 6.7 times greater than that of the unmodified photocatalyst. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding that of most reported polymer photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production utilizing conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)&#8208;based photocatalysts represents a crucial green technology for achieving solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Proper material design is paramount to improve the dispersity and charge transfer of CMPs for enhanced H2O2 production performance. Herein, a post&#8208;modification strategy employing chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production. The simple one&#8208;step chloromethylation reaction simultaneously achieved two objectives: One is enhanced hydrophilicity through the hydrolysis of cyanogen groups in the pyranonitrile unit to carboxyl groups, the other&#160;is the improved O2 adsorption and charge transfer by incorporating chloromethyl groups. The two objectives synergistically enhanced the H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP named DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl, reaching 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, 6.7&#8208;fold of the unmodified photocatalyst. Moreover, the rate achieved at an O2 atmosphere increased by only 1.8%, highlighting its superior O2 utilization efficiency in air. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding most reported polymer photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical results corroborated the predominant role of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway in the H2O2 generation. This work demonstrates the potential of a post&#8208;modification method to significantly enhance H2O2 production performance directly from water and air.

         <title>Equalized Dual Emissions from Copper Complexes via Multichannel Balanced Intersystem Crossing: Toward 100% Quantum Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emissions containing equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence are achieved by a copper iodide complex QtBCzTTPPCuI, which exhibits &#8764;100% photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high twofold increased external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% among pure&#8208;yellow spin&#8208;coated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, owing to the contributions of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer excited states to intersystem crossing.








Abstract
Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, &#8764;100% photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% for pure&#8208;yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered triplet states into dual&#8208;emissive electroluminescence is based on energy&#8208;level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Cyclization of Amide&#8208;Type 1,6&#8208;Enynes Enabled by H&#8211;[Pd]&#8211;CN Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Three distinctive asymmetric 1,6&#8208;enyne cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, have been developed, providing a modular synthetic platform for various chiral &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, are also conducted. 








Abstract
Enantioselective cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been extensively developed as it offers an effective way to obtain chiral cyclic compounds. Herein, we report a divergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;substituted propiolamides, which allows for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Three distinctive cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, were successfully developed. The product can be selected by using different initial substrates under the same catalytic conditions or by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions for the same initial substrate. This catalytic system boasts broad substrate scope and wide functional&#8208;group compatibility, where a diverse range of substituents on the aryl group and amide nitrogen atom were tolerated. The combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations revealed the fundamental role of the ligand in regioselectivity and the role of H2O in the sequential cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation reactions. H2O can lower the energy barrier of the reductive elimination step, thus promoting the reaction toward the target product formation.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Ligate and Release Strategy Based on Photoclick Reaction in Tandem with Pd&#8208;Mediated Deallylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consecutive, controllable, and revertible new&#8208;to&#8208;nature ligation and cleavage strategy has been rationally devised to selectively visualize and manipulate biomolecules of interest. The photoclick cycloaddition between allenyl phenyl ether motifs and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone analogues installed a terminal allyl handle at the exocyclic site, thereby enabling on&#8208;demand Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation to release phenolic payloads (copyright permission obtained from BioRender).








Abstract
The development of chemoselective tools that can conjugate, modify, and decouple chemical groups from biomacromolecules has enabled the study of biological processes at increasing levels of fidelity. Until recently, these tools can either couple chemical entities to biomacromolecules or decouple them, but not both. A method that can perform these functions in distinct steps on demand would be highly useful. To that end, we devised a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature strategy by bringing together and modifying two biocompatible transformations. In this new strategy, ligation is accomplished via the photoclick reaction between an allenyl motif with 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone which installs an allyl group at the site of conjugation. This allyl group can then be selectively utilized as a handle for phenolic release via Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated its utility in the selective labeling and delabeling of model protein scaffolds and cellular matrix. This multifunctional method paves the way for a controllable &#8220;ligate and release&#8221; strategy that enables on&#8208;demand visualization of biological entities but with an in built release mechanism to restore their original state.

         <title>Turing&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Precise Peptide Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Turing&#8208;structured COF membrane with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures is created via the modulation based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry. The resulting COF membrane exhibits simultaneously enhanced water permeation and molecular sieving properties, demonstrating its great potential in the separation of high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Turing structures have emerged as promising features for separation membranes, enabling significantly enhanced water permeation due to their ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities. So far, Turing structures are constrained by the highly cross&#8208;linked and heterogeneous porosities, impeding them from the application of molecular separations requiring loose but regular pore structures. This work reports a covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membrane with nanoscale striped Turing structures for fast and precise molecular separations. Porous and hydrophilic modulation layers based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry are constructed on polymeric substrates, which are capable of enhancing the uptake and controlled release of the activator of amines during synthesis. The appropriately reduced diffusion rate triggers the phenomenon of &#8220;local activation and lateral inhibition&#8221; arising from thermodynamic instability, creating Turing structures with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures. The Turing&#8208;type COF membranes exhibit a water permeance of 45.0 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is approximately 13 times greater than the non&#8208;Turing membranes, and an ultrahigh selectivity of up to 638 for two model peptides. This work demonstrates the feasibility that Turing structures with ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities can be created in COF membranes and underscores their superiority in molecular separations, including but not limited to high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Modular Access to Arylethylamines Enabled by Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroarylation of Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, affording various valuable arylethylamines with exclusive regiocontrol. The use of NHC&#9472;Ni catalyst was crucial to achieve high efficiency and selectivity. In particular, with bulky chiral NHC ligands, enantioenriched arylethylamines were prepared in high efficiency with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cu6Sn5 Alloy Electrocatalysts for Formaldehyde Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Bipolar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; alloy was developed as a high&#8208;performance, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst for the anodic formaldehyde oxidative dehydrogenation (FOD) reaction. When paired with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it enables a formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer, facilitating energy&#8208;efficient bipolar hydrogen production and the generation of value&#8208;added formate.








Abstract
Aldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers an attractive pathway for energy&#8208;saving bipolar hydrogen production with combined faradaic efficiency (FE) of 200% while converting formaldehyde into value&#8208;added formate. Herein we report the design and synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free Cu6Sn5 alloy as a highly effective electrocatalyst for formaldehyde electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating a geometric current density of 915&#160;&#177;&#160;46&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming many noble metal electrocatalysts reported previously. The formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer delivers 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 0.124&#160;V, and a current density of 486&#160;&#177;&#160;20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V without any iR compensation and exhibits nearly 200% faradaic efficiency for bipolar hydrogen production at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 88&#160;h long&#8208;term operation. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the notably lowered barriers for dehydrogenation and Tafel steps on the Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; surface compared to Cu, underscoring its potential as a highly active catalyst.

         <dc:description>
Rare examples of nitrogen phosphorus heterocyclic carbene (NPHC) complexes of group 6 and 7 metals arise from a facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of phosphinoisocyanides (LnM&#8208;CNPR2) with activated alkynes. The NPHC ligands are shown to be comparatively &#960;&#8208;acidic and the group 6 examples undergo facile transfer of the intact carbene to gold(I) centres.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Triggered Orbital Hybridization in FeMn Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Toward Sabatier&#8208;Optimized Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn dual&#8208;atom catalyst on a porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix is synthesized via a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. The defect&#8208;mediated coordination strengthens Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization, optimizing adsorption energy toward Sabatier optimality. The catalyst delivers a 0.921&#160;V half&#8208;wave potential for alkaline oxygen reduction and excellent Zn&#8208;air battery performance.








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSAs), leveraging synergistic dual&#8208;site interactions, represent a promising frontier in electrocatalysis. However, the precise synthesis of dual&#8208;atom pairs and fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic structures remain significant challenges. Herein, we construct a defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn&#8208;DSA anchored on a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeMnDSA/dNC) through a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. This defect modulation strategy effectively stabilizes dual atomic pairs while optimizing electronic structures to approach Sabatier's optimality, significantly boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The FeMnDSA/dNC achieves a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.921&#160;V in alkaline media, with assembled zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrating 291&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density and stable charge/discharge cycling for over 500&#160;h. Theoretical calculations reveal that defect&#8208;mediated coordination adjacent to Fe&#8208;Mn diatomic centers triggers charge redistribution, suppressing antibonding orbital populations while strengthening Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization. This modulation weakens O&#9472;O bonding through optimized *OOH adsorption configurations, thereby enhancing ORR kinetics. The present work provides valuable insights into the precise modulation and the underlying mechanisms of DSAs, advancing the design of electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

This defect modulation strategy effectively stabilizes dual atomic pairs while optimizing electronic structures to approach Sabatier's optimality, significantly boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance.

&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;NC achieves a high half-wave potential of 0.921&#160;V in alkaline media, with assembled zinc-air batteries demonstrating 291&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; peak power density and stable charge/discharge cycling for over 500&#160;h. Theoretical calculations reveal that defect-mediated coordination adjacent to Fe-Mn diatomic centers triggers charge redistribution, suppressing antibonding orbital populations while strengthening Fe 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;

The present work provides valuable insights into the precise modulation and the underlying mechanisms of DSAs, advancing the design of electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Soft Self&#8208;Assembly from Melt: The Ubiquitous Heat Capacity Hump and Spontaneous Melt Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transition from melt to most complex liquid crystal (LC) phases is weak 1st order but is preceded by a large heat capacity maximum. In addition, a chiral liquid forms through another transition before that to the LC, despite the compounds being achiral. We investigate these poorly understood phenomena experimentally and develop a statistical theory that fits the experiments remarkably well, giving new insights into the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly and pre&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We investigate two unusual phenomena in self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic molecules from isotropic (Iso) melt: a heat&#8208;capacity (Cp) maximum and spontaneous formation of the recently discovered chiral liquid (Iso*). Based on experiments on new nonchiral monomers, dimers, and polymers, we construct a statistical theory that shows why many complex meso&#8208;structures form in two stages: continuous equilibrium growth of nano&#8208;clusters in melt through strong interactions, causing the Cp&#8208;maximum, followed by establishment of positional long&#8208;range order (LRO) through a weak first&#8208;order transition. We also show why many achiral compounds additionally form an intermediate chiral Iso* liquid through what we find is a second&#8208;order transition. We propose that the first process is equivalent to &#8220;supramolecular polymerization&#8221; in solutions, where the lack of intercluster interaction rules out LRO. Furthermore, we argue that separation into a broad and a sharp transition is universal in condensed matter where strong interactions by themselves cannot lead to LRO, either because the clusters are 1D or due to strong frustration. Clusters must first grow to critical size when, at Tc, the combined weak interactions reach &#8764;kBTc, prompting LRO formation. A situation similar to that in soft self&#8208;assembly is seen in spin ordering in magnetic crystals, but only near 0&#160;K.

         <title>Machine Learning Reveals In&#8208;Cavity Versus Surface Activity for Selective C&#9472;H Borylation by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of 45 general descriptors was developed to capture the diverse structural features of a wide range of MOFs, enabling the study of MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for C&#9472;H borylation. This analysis revealed key factors that govern sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, allowing for the rational design of Ni catalysts with up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an expansive and tunable platform for heterogeneous catalysis, yet distinguishing between catalytic reactions occurring within their pores and those on their external surfaces remains a challenge. This study employs interpretable machine learning to elucidate structure&#8208;activity relationships in MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for selective sp3 and sp2 C&#9472;H borylation. By analyzing over 470&#160;000 MOF structures, we developed a set of 45 concise and chemically meaningful descriptors that capture key structural variations across MOFs. These descriptors enabled us to identify the critical factors governing sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, revealing distinct activation mechanisms: sp3 C&#9472;H borylation preferentially occurs within MOF cavities via a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, whereas sp2 C&#9472;H borylation is associated with surface or defect sites, favoring a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) pathway. Guided by these insights, we designed Ni catalysts that achieve up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity. This work provides a systematic framework for rational catalyst design and establishes generalizable principles for controlling activity preference in MOF&#8208;supported catalysis.

         <title>Local Atomic Off&#8208;Centering Mediated Efficient Self&#8208;Trapped Excitonic Emission in Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 nanoplates exhibit reasonably photostable and intense broadband sky&#8208;blue emission, originating from self&#8208;trapped excitons. The self&#8208;trapping of excitons occurs due to strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling, which is created by elastic structural distortion on the atomic scale. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering studies reveal the local structural distortion to be crafted by off&#8208;centering the copper atom.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional metal halides have received significant recognition attributable to their intriguing optoelectronic properties, which instigate the emergence of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) accompanied by intense broadband emissions. However, fundamental crystal structural origin of such STE is still elusive. Herein, we have synthesized Cu(I)&#8208;based mixed halide, Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 nanoplates (NPs) using room temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation method, which showed an intense blue emission with broad line&#8208;width, large Stokes shift, long photoluminescence lifetime, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8764;75%. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL intensity and line&#8208;width analysis unfolded strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling in NP sample. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis determines the local Cu off&#8208;centering, which provides the required lattice anharmonicity and softness for intense STE in Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 NPs. The existence of such soft lattice structure associated with low&#8208;energy phonons was verified by sound velocity, Raman spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature heat capacity measurements. The fluorescence microscopy and super&#8208;resolution optical imaging were implemented at single&#8208;particle level which exhibited minimal temporal PL intermittency with reasonable photostability under high&#8208;intensity illumination. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the intense broadband emission of NPs are &#160;accompanied by the local atomic off&#8208;centering&#8208;driven lattice deformation during photo&#8208;excitation process.

         <title>Regulating Ion Transport Through Direct Coordination in Composite Gel Polymer Electrolytes Toward High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Loading Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes. The composite gel polymer electrolyte facilitates high&#8208;performance Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cell. 








Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt;4.0&#160;V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. What's more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium&#8208;ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes and dendrite&#8208;free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum&#8208;based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Specially, cells with 8.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(ethylene oxide)-based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&amp;lt;4.0&#160;V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni-rich layered cathodes. What's more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium-ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high-load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium-ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium-ion fluxes and dendrite-free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum-based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Specially, cells with 8.8&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid-state lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of Cyclic Olefin Polymers via Group Transfer Radical Cyclopolymerization for High Performance in Anode&#8208;Free Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative group transfer radical cyclopolymerization (GTRCP) method has been developed for the precise synthesis of functionalized cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) using non&#8208;conjugated diene monomers. Through rational monomer design, various polar groups are incorporated into the COP backbones. The resulting polymers exhibit high molecular weights, low dispersities, controllable chain sequences, and high structural diversity. The polymer can function as a robust interphase layer, enhancing the reversibility of lithium plating/stripping in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) are of high importance in optical and medical materials. These materials are typically synthesized via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene derivatives, using metallocene catalysts, followed by high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation catalyzed by noble metals. However, the complex synthetic processes, the continuous use of expensive catalysts, and the need to remove metal residues remain substantial barriers in COP production. In contrast, radical cyclopolymerization of dienes, which eliminates the need for metal catalysis and hydrogenation, offers a promising alternative for COP synthesis. Nevertheless, chain transfer reactions hinder the radical polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated dienes. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy, group transfer radical cyclopolymerization (GTRCP), which effectively suppresses chain transfer and enables radical polymerization of dienes to yield COPs. This approach allows for the production of a broad range of sequence&#8208;regulated COPs with high molecular weights and low dispersity. Density functional theory calculations support the proposed GTRCP mechanism, highlighting its efficiency and selectivity, driven by substantial thermodynamic forces. The resulting COPs demonstrate great potential as the interphase layer materials in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries, significantly enhancing the cycling performance towards practical energy storage applications.

         <title>Interfacial Water Structure Modulation on Unconventional Phase Non&#8208;Precious Metal Alloy Nanostructures for Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free CuNi alloy nanostructures with unconventional hcp/fcc heterophase has been successfully achieved. Notably, hcp/fcc CuNi nanoalloys demonstrate much superior catalytic performance toward ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrate than the common fcc CuNi counterparts. Mechanism studies reveal that the hcp/fcc CuNi alloys facilitate the formation of K+&#8211;H2O, enhance the interfacial water dissociation, and create high *H coverage, thereby boosting the ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has been recognized as a sustainable route for nitrate removal and value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Regulating the surface active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial but remains a formidable challenge, especially in neutral electrolytes, greatly limiting the highly selective NH3 formation. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of heterophase hcp/fcc non&#8208;precious CuNi alloy nanostructures for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis in neutral media. Significantly, hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 exhibits excellent performance with NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.1% and 57.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, respectively. In situ studies suggest that the high proportion of interfacial K+ ion hydrated water (K+&#8211;H2O) on hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 creates high *H coverage via boosting interfacial water dissociation, enabling the rapid hydrogenation kinetics for NH3 synthesis. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior NO3RR performance of hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 originates from both the existence of hcp phase to improve the electroactivity and the high Ni content to guarantee an efficient active hydrogen supply. The strong interaction between Ni and Cu also optimizes the electronic structures of Cu sites to realize fast intermediate conversions with low energy barriers. This work provides a novel strategy to optimize surface *H behavior via tuning interfacial water structure by crystal phase control.

         <title>A Robust Nickel&#8208;Interlocked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Catalyst for Photocatalytic Aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;decorated pyrene&#8208; and bipyridine&#8208;based olefin&#8208;linked COF (  Ni@COF1  ) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre&#8208;installed Ni(II) centers. Compared to its reduced counterpart (  Ni@COF1R  ),  Ni@COF1  exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late&#8208;stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number &gt;850. These results highlight the significance of olefin&#8208;linked COFs in advancing sustainable photocatalysis and expanding their role in fine chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations.

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein-based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood-brain-barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled-coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7-fold increased encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) compared to TRAP and demonstrates improved uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near-infrared (NIR) dye-labelled TMPA (NIR-TMPA) is injected into mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and fit to a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model. NIR-TMPA demonstrates prolonged short-phase half-life in tumor-bearing mice compared to control with similar slow-phase half-life, leading to an increased area-under-the-curve clearance and pointing to its sequestration in the tumor site. Endpoint fluorescence analysis of mouse organs ex vivo also supports this conclusion. TMPA and its future derivatives therefore bear potential for targeted treatment of GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction as a Mechanistic Probe for Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to alter reaction kinetics. Hypotheses on how it does this have been proposed, but open questions remain regarding the importance of the polarity of the reaction mechanism and of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), among other factors. We propose the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed&#8208;width cavities and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3&#8208;diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C=C bond. In all cases, no changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Unconventional Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis Enabled by Co,Fe Dual&#8208;Site Conjugated Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis, while the intricate multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer processes and unstable intermediates pose significant challenges in attaining high selectivity and efficiency. This study demonstrates a Co,Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe&#8208;cMOFs) that enable efficient NO3RR via an unconventional [6+2] electron&#8208;transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2+6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO3&#8722; to *NH2OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO2&#8722; and guarantees selective NH3 production. The CoFe&#8208;cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery prototype incorporating CoFe&#8208;cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density with stable NH3 production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the investigation of inorganic reagents containing the pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) moiety is presented. First, the gram&#8208;scale preparation of the reactive yet stable pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) as well as its spectroscopic data are reported. Then, the preparation and full characterization of the corresponding fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO3SF5, FSPO) by the fluoro&#8208;pentafluorooxosulfanylation of SO2 are highlighted. This liquid reagent (b.p. 39.6&#176;C) was later successfully used for modulable release of [cat][OSF5] ion&#8208;pair. The selective, in&#8208;solution release of SOF4 and SOF4/SO2F2 species was also demonstrated. Finally, the SuFEx reactivity was investigated and showed interesting reservoir ability. Indeed, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sulfonyl fluoride (&#8208;SO2F) and sulfurimidoyl fluoride (&#8208;N=S(O)F2) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Light Catalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet and visible light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM led to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti3AlC2, V2AlC and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials of key processes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process-specific phase diagrams to model A-element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti3AlC2, V2AlC and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Inositol Pyrophosphate Toolbox: Stereoselective Synthesis and Application of PP&#8208;InsP4 Isomers in Plant Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well&#8208;characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP&#8208;InsPs, such as 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP5 (5&#8208;InsP7) and 1,5&#8208;(PP)2&#8208;InsP4 (1,5&#8208;InsP8), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31P&#8208;NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18O&#8208;labeled PP&#8208;InsP4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE&#8208;MS), enabling the assignment of PP&#8208;InsP4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation&#8208;induced root&#8208;specific PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer does not match any 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 and [3&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 at the 5&#8208;position, while other InsP5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP&#8208;InsP4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP&#8208;InsP4, providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging&#8208;Based High&#8208;Content Screening with Clickable Probes Identifies XPB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS&#8217;s ability to directly assess drug&#8208;protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging&#8208;based HCS and bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized a probe TL&#8208;alkyne (TL&#8208;alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe&#8208;labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated the XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1,874 FDA&#8208;approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with Cys342 of XPB, suppressed XPB&#8217;s ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The dynamic catalyst&#8217;s restructuring creates a new catalytic surface&#160;that&#160;is essential for boosting the efficiency of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR).&#160;In this&#160;work, we synthesize Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2&#160;hollow microboxes using a co&#8208;precipitation method followed by&#160;a&#160;hydrothermal treatment.&#160;Based on&#160;a collection of&#160;in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situcharacterizations including&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;Raman spectroscopy,&#160;rapid&#160;freeze&#8208;quench&#160;(RFQ)&#160;119Sn&#160;M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we discover that the Ag&#8208;decorated&#160;SnS2&#160;(Ag@SnS2) hollow microboxes&#160;undergo dynamic reduction and reconstruction during the electrochemical CO2RR, leading to the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formation of&#160;S&#8208;doped Ag&#8208;Sn alloy (S&#8208;Ag3Sn/Sn)&#160;hollow microboxes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Indium Single&#8208;Atom Sites Anchored on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Single&#8208;Layer Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 into Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electroreduction of CO2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. We developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of a single&#8208;layer zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted as Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH = 1.67) at &#8722;1.8 V vs. RHE, the Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3 mA cm&#8722;2. The system maintains operational stability over 20 hours without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid&#8208;state electrolyte at 4 V full&#8208;cell voltage, Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5 mmol L&#8722;1, 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5&#8208;fold higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: (i) the low&#8208;coordinated In(III) single&#8208;atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single&#8208;intermediate adsorption on high&#8208;coordination metal centers; and (ii) the single&#8208;layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Crystalline&#160;2D&#160;Conjugated&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic&#160;Framework&#160;for Superior Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, developing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with multiple redox&#8208;active sites and well&#8208;defined structures to enhance the performance of SIBs and elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationship remains challenging. Herein, a 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystal (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH&#8208;TBP) ligand. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic&#8208;level crystal structure of Cu&#8208;TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer&#8208;stacking. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu&#8208;TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1). Experimental studies combined with theoretical calculations further elucidate the Na+ storage mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, polymer&#8208;containing Cage&#8208;POPs and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;Tag Chemical Inducers of Dimerization to Probe Receptor Oligomerization and Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling protein&#8208;protein interactions is critical for dissecting signaling pathways, especially those initiated by ligand&#8208;receptor interactions which alter receptor oligomerization and drive downstream signaling cascades. Traditional methods for driving protein&#8208;protein complexes are using antibodies that face limitations in terms of stoichiometry, geometric rigidity, and antibody specificity. Chemical Inducers of Dimerization (CIDs) for fusion proteins such as HaloTag (Halo) and SNAP&#8208;Tags (SNAP) offer precise and covalent control of protein proximities, overcoming limitations of antibody&#8208;dependent methods. In this study, we expand the toolkit of Halo and SNAP CIDs with (1) benzylguanine (BG) and HaloTag ligand (HTL) crosslinkers featuring varying polyethylene glycol linker lengths and update this kit with (2) a FRET&#8208;based dimerizing sensor to induce and verify protein proximity. Here we establish our CIDs on extracellularly Halo&#8208; and SNAP&#8208;tagged TGF&#946;, BMP, neurotrophic factor and metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby elucidating the signaling potential of ligand&#8208;independent dimerization in a heteromeric fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsaturated Phosphine Oxides for Modular Antibody Rebridging and Single Reagent Peptide&#8208;Cyclisation&#8208;Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals; especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>
