         <title>Fe&#8208;O4 Motif Activated Graphitic Carbon via Oxo&#8208;Bridge for Highly Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based materials have been utilized as effective catalysts for hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR), however the insufficient selectivity and productivity still hindered the further industrial applications. In this work, we report the Fe&#8208;O4 motif activated graphitic carbon material which enabled highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis operating at high current density with excellent anti&#8208;poisoning property. In the bulk production test, the concentration of H2O2 cumulated to 8.6% in 24 h and the corresponding production rate of 33.5 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 outperformed all previously reported materials. Theoretical model backed by in&#8208;situ characterization verified &#945;&#8208;C surrounding the Fe&#8208;O4 motif as the actual reaction site in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics aspects. The strategy of activating carbon reaction site by metal center via oxo&#8208;bridge provides inspiring insights for the rational design of carbon materials for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the Charge&#8208;Density of Tetrahedral Cobalt(II) Centers through Carbon&#8208;Layer Modulation Promotes C&#8208;H Activation in the Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction (PDH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure of active metal centers plays an indispensable role in regulating catalytic reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis, developing other metals as promoters to decorate electronic state is a common strategy, while non&#8208;metal component of carbon as electronic additives to regulate d&#8208;band center has rarely been studied in thermal&#8208;catalysis field. Herein, we report electron&#8208;deficient tetrahedral Co(II) (Td&#8208;cobalt(II)) centers through carbon&#8208;layer modulation for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is indicated that bifunctional sites of both Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and metallic&#8208;cobalt are designed, and the in&#8208;situ generated carbon through the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt can cover the inactive metallic&#8208;cobalt and tailor d&#8208;band of active Td&#8208;cobalt(II) simultaneously. More importantly, the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer is proposed to decrease electron density of Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and make d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level, consequently promotes C&#8208;H activation in PDH reaction. This study provides new perspective for the utilization of inactive carbon as electronic promoters and unlocks new opportunity to fabricate efficient PDH and other heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a results, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64% at 260 mA cm&#8208;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32% at 140 mA cm&#8208;2 &#8212; nearly 1.3 times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3 V at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo&#8208;Selective Epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;Epoxonium Ring&#8208;Opening Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing the nucleophilicity of the terminal hydroxy group of a polyepoxy alcohol precursor and adding a Lewis acid, we can effectively construct polyethers with hydrogen atoms at ring junctions, consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring, and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyethers through epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization. We suggest that marine ladder polyethers may also be biosynthesized via this mode of cyclization.







Abstract
Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin's rules of ring closure state that exo&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over endo&#8208;selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF4/PFTB (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol) and found that all&#8208;endo products were formed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin's rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all&#8208;endo&#8208;selective cyclization was inhibition of exo&#8208;selective hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow&#8208;release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyether fragments by epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid. We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization of polyepoxide.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Grafted Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8722;Nx Complex with a Precisely Regulating Coordination Sphere for Efficient Electron Acceptor&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt SAs through the strategy of external ligand grafting on MOFs, the electron density and steric factor of Pt(II) centers thereby were achieved accurate modulation. In addition, the incorporation of Pt(bpy)Cl2 as an electron acceptor induced the efficient interface migration of photoinduced electrons, relizing a 225&#8208;times improvement of photocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Based on the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl2 molecule, a simple post&#8208;modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, which performed as a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiOx migration to external BDC&#8594;PtNx migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post&#8208;modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8722;Nx coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as&#8208;synthesized NML&#8208;PtN2 exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26&#8197;times compared to pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and NML&#8208;PtN4, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01&#8201;% (390&#8197;nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 (0.78&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt SA; 129&#8197;times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF&#8208;Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single&#8208;atom coordination sphere.

&lt;p&gt;Based on the electron-withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, a simple post-modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125, which performed as a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; migration to external BDC&#8594;PtN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post-modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as-synthesized NML-PtN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26&#8197;times compared to pristine NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125 and NML-PtN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01&#8201;% (390&#8197;nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (0.78&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt SA; 129&#8197;times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF-Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single-atom coordination sphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Self&#8208;Assembly of Dissipative Structures Sustained by Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients.







Abstract
The coupling between energy&#8208;consuming molecular processes and the macroscopic dimension plays an important role in nature and in the development of active matter. Here, we study the temporal evolution of a macroscopic system upon the local activation of a dissipative self&#8208;assembly process. Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic (pseudo&#8208;)non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients. For elevated substrate concentrations, this state can be maintained for more than 4&#8197;days. The studies reveal an interdependence between the dissipative assemblies and the concentration gradients: catalytic activity by the assemblies results in sustained concentration gradients and, vice versa, continuous diffusion of substrate to the assemblies stabilizes their size. The possibility to activate dissipative processes with spatial control and create long lasting non&#8208;equilibrium steady states enables dissipative structures to be studied in the space&#8208;time domain, which is of relevance for understanding biological systems and for the development of active matter.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic sp&#8208;Chain Ligands: Isoelectronic B/N Analogues of E. O. Fischer's Alkynylcarbynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation and subsequent halide abstraction of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand affords a cationic complex featuring a rare linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes an unique chain elongation reaction via iminoborane carboration reaction with bis(tert&#8208;butyl)iminoborane, giving access to a five&#8208;atom B/N chain.







Abstract
Borylation of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand and halide abstraction provides access to a cationic complex with an unprecedented linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with azides, and an unexpected chain&#8208;extension reaction with an iminoborane, leading to a complex with a five&#8208;atom B/N chain. These two [NNBR]&#8208;containing complexes, inorganic analogues of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's alkynylcarbynes, are very rare examples of molecules containing all&#8208;inorganic chains of sp&#8208;hybridized atoms.

         <title>Selective Macrocyclization of Unprotected Peptides with an Ex Situ Gaseous Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that enables amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8208;aniline crosslinking by a minimalist linchpin strategy was used to form macrocyclic urea or carbamate products in unprotected peptides. The reaction is operationally simple and tolerates a wide range of other amino acids. Cyclization of bioactive cyclic peptides provided a variety of bicyclic peptides with novel topologies.







Abstract
Peptide cyclization has dramatic effects on a variety of important properties, enhancing metabolic stability, limiting conformational flexibility, and altering cellular entry and intracellular localization. The hydrophilic, polyfunctional nature of peptides creates chemoselectivity challenges in macrocyclization, especially for natural sequences without biorthogonal handles. Herein, we describe a gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that achieves amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8211;aniline crosslinking through a minimalist linchpin strategy that affords macrocyclic urea or carbamate products. The cyclization reaction is metal&#8208;mediated and involves a novel application of sulfine species that remains unexplored in aqueous or biological contexts. The aqueous method delivers unique cyclic or bicyclic topologies directly from a variety of natural bioactive peptides without the need for protecting&#8208;group strategies.

         <title>Efficient Enzymatic Synthesis of Carbamates in Water Using Promiscuous Esterases/Acyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis performed under harsh reaction conditions often requires the need for protecting groups to prevent off&#8208;target reactions. While traditional chemical introduction of protecting groups disagrees with the principles of green chemistry, biocatalysis provides a promising alternative. Herein, we present an unprecedented enzymatic approach for the efficient synthesis of carbamate&#8208;protected amines in water achieving up to 99&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Biocatalysis provides an attractive approach to facilitate synthetic reactions in aqueous media. Motivated by the discovery of promiscuous aminolysis activity of esterases, we exploited the esterase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 (PestE) for the synthesis of carbamates from different aliphatic, aromatic, and arylaliphatic amines and a set of carbonates such as dimethyl&#8208;, dibenzyl&#8208;, or diallyl carbonate. Thus, aniline and benzylamine derivatives, aliphatic and even secondary amines could be efficiently converted into the corresponding benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)&#8208; or allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc)&#8208;protected products in bulk water, with (isolated) yields of up to 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#9651;H) and entropy barrier (&#9651;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#9651;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#9651;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#9651;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Nanoneedle Electrodes for Dopamine Detection in Drosophila</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrodes were generated by a new 3D printing process that utilize pulling force of a bridge between two blocks. We optimized the block size, bridge length, and bridge diameter to maximize shrinkage and make smaller electrodes. These nanoneedle electrodes have long, straight, and thin tips, which enable dopamine detection in Drosophila larvae ventral nerve cord (VNC).







Abstract
In vivo electrochemistry in small brain regions or synapses requires nanoelectrodes with long straight tips for submicron scale measurements. Nanoelectrodes can be fabricated using a Nanoscribe two&#8208;photon printer, but annealed tips curl if they are long and thin. We propose a new pulling&#8208;force strategy to fabricate a straight carbon nanoneedle structure. A micron&#8208;width bridge is printed between two blocks. The annealed structure shrinks during pyrolysis, and the blocks create a pulling force to form a long, thin, and straight carbon bridge. Parameterization study and COMSOL modeling indicate changes in the block size, bridge size and length affect the pulling force and bridge shrinkage. Electrodes were printed on niobium wires, insulated with aluminum oxide, and the bridge cut with focused ion beam (FIB) to expose the nanoneedle tip. Annealed needle diameters ranged from 400&#8197;nm to 5.25&#8197;&#956;m and length varied from 50.5&#8197;&#956;m to 146&#8197;&#956;m. The electrochemical properties are similar to glassy carbon, with good performance for dopamine detection with fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry. Nanoelectrodes enable biological applications, such as dopamine detection in a specific Drosophila brain region. Long and thin nanoneedles are generally useful for other applications such as cellular sensing, drug delivery, or gas sensing.

         <title>A Processible and Ultrahigh&#8208;temperature Organic Photothermal Material through Spontaneous and Quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8211;Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A processible and stable organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material ATT was facilely prepare by a spontaneous and quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Cycloreversion. ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photo&#8208;irradiation, enabling its applications in the high&#8208;temperature processes, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;fusion, photo&#8208;stamp, photo&#8208;weld and photo&#8208;controlled shaper memory.







Abstract
Energy conversion, particularly light to heat conversion, has garnered significant attention owing to its prospect in renewable energy exploitation and utilization. Most previous efforts have focused on developing organic photothermal materials for low&#8208;temperature applications, whereas the importance of simplifying the preparation methods of photothermal materials and enhancing their maximum photothermal temperature have been less taken. Herein, we prepare an organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material namely ATT by a spontaneous [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;cycloreversion reaction. In addition to the solution&#8208;based method, ATT could also be readily preapred by ball milling in a high yield of 90&#8201;% in just 15&#8197;min. ATT powder exhibits a broad absorption extending beyond 2000&#8197;nm, excellent processability, and thermal stability. Remarkably, ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photoirradiation. Leveraging its extraordinary photothermal and processable properties, ATT was used in the high&#8208;temperature applications, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;controlled metal processing and high&#8208;temperature shape memory, all of which offer spatiotemporal control capabilities. This work provides a new approach to prepare organic photothermal materials with high temperatures, and pave the way for their applications in extreme environments.

         <title>Ordering Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Pd Catalysts onto Orderly Mesoporous SrTiO3&#8208;Crystal Nanotubular Networks for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work resolved the inherent contradiction between the superior pore structure and crystallinity of metal oxides by developing an updated synthesis method using the electrospinning technique, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer in photocatalytic heterogeneous reactions. With the assistance of ordered Cu&#8722;Pd alloy, the catalysts exhibit a remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of fuels has garnered significant attention, with SrTiO3 emerging as a potential candidate for photocatalysis due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. However, selectively converting CO2 into fuels with desired reaction products remains a grand challenge. Herein, we design an updated method via an aging strategy based on the electrospinning technique to synthesize a single&#8208;crystalline Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 nanotubular networks with self&#8208;assembled orderly mesopores, further modified by Cu&#8722;Pd alloy. It exhibits both high crystallinity and superior cross&#8208;linked mesoporous structures, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer, with a remarkable enhancement from 0.025&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 1.090&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 in the CO production rate. Meanwhile, the ordered arrangement of Cu and Pd atoms on the (111) surface can promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*CO2 to *COOH), which is also responsible for its good activity. The presence of CuO in the reaction confers a significant advantage for CO desorption, leading to a remarkable CO selectivity of 95.54&#8201;%. This work highlights new insights into developing advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of n&#8208;Propanol from CO2 Electroreduction on Bicontinuous Cu2O/Cu Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Propanol can be efficiently produced by ampere&#8208;level CO2 electroreduction by a Cu2O/Cu catalyst with bicontinuous structure. The catalyst is assembled by nanodomains (&lt;10&#8197;nm) of Cu2O and Cu and possesses numerous grain boundaries between the Cu and Cu2O phases.







Abstract
n&#8208;propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n&#8208;propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n&#8208;propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra&#8208;small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n&#8208;propanol current density is as high as 101.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1&#8201;%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO&#8208;*CO coupling and *CO&#8208;*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n&#8208;propanol.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;DNA Carriers Co&#8208;Deliver Photosensitizer and siRNA for Light&#8208;Promoted Gene Transfection and Hypoxia&#8208;Relieved Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing synthetic polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras provides new opportunities for material development. Herein, we demonstrate that the micellar nanostructures self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA chimeras can efficiently, straightforwardly, and bio&#8208;compatibly co&#8208;deliver siRNA and organic photosensitizers, resulting in significantly enhanced gene/photodynamic synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy.







Abstract
Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA&#8208;interference gene regulation, which makes gene&#8208;photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self&#8208;assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA&#8208;administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co&#8208;delivery capability.

Herein, we demonstrate that the micellar nanostructures self-assembled from polymer-DNA chimeras can efficiently, straightforwardly, and bio-compatibly co-deliver siRNA and organic photosensitizers, resulting in significantly enhanced gene/photodynamic synergistic anti-tumor efficacy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA-interference gene regulation, which makes gene-photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self-assembled from polymer-DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self-assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA-administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti-tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co-delivery capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protonation of an Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis under Visible Light up to 700&#8201;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation is found to be a simple and efficient strategy to upgrade the COFs&#8217; photocatalytic activity for H2O2 synthesis. The protonation extends the light absorption, provides proton sources for H2O2 generation, simplifies the reaction pathways, and increases the H2O2 selectivity from oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for H2O2 production from water via oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of COFs for efficient H2O2 production indubitably hinges on an in&#8208;depth understanding of their ORR mechanisms. In this work, taking an imine&#8208;linked COF as an example, we demonstrate that protonation of the functional units such as imine, amine, and triazine, is a highly efficient strategy to upgrade the activity levels for H2O2 synthesis. The protonation not only extends the light absorption of the COF but also provides proton sources that directly participate in H2O2 generation. Notably, the protonation simplifies the reaction pathways of ORR to H2O2, i.e. from an indirect superoxide radical (

O2&#8226;-

 ${{O}_{2}^{\bullet -}}$



) mediated route to a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron route. Theoretical calculations confirm that the protonation favors H2O2 synthesis due to easy access of protons near the reaction sites that removes the energy barrier for generating *OOH intermediate. These findings not only extend the mechanistic insight into H2O2 photosynthesis but also provide a rational guideline for the design and upgradation of efficient COFs.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl Thiazolines from 4&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehydes Using Vanillyl Alcohol Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols in the presence of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) occurred through a spontaneous condensation reaction followed by preferential enzymatic oxidation of the in situ generated C&#8722;N bond over other competing functional groups. The biocatalysts showed good substrate tolerance, and the enzymatic products could be chemically modified to expand the structural diversity.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles are commonly found in bioactive natural products and drugs. However, the biocatalytic tools for nitrogen heterocycle synthesis are limited. Herein, we report the discovery of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) as efficient biocatalysts for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from various 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols. The wild&#8208;type biocatalyst features a broad scope of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes. Though the scope of aminothiols is limited, it could be improved via semi&#8208;rational protein engineering, generating a variant to produce previously inaccessible cysteine&#8208;derived bioactive 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines using the wild&#8208;type VAO. Benefiting from the derivatizable functional groups in the enzymatic products, we further chemically modified these products to expand the chemical space, offering a new chemoenzymatic strategy for the green and efficient synthesis of structurally diverse 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;thiazoline derivatives to prompt their use in drug discovery and catalysis.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterometallic [2]Catenanes and Cyclic Bis[2]catenanes via Orthogonal Metal&#8208;Coordination Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes were prepared efficiently via orthogonal metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the multiple positively charged nature, as well as the potential synergistic effect of the Cu(I) and Pt(II) metal ions, the cyclic bis[2]catenanes displayed broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity.







Abstract
Although catenated cages have been widely constructed due to their unique and elegant topological structures, cyclic catenanes formed by the connection of multiple catenane units have been rarely reported. Herein, based on the orthogonal metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we prepare a series of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes, whose structures are clearly evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the multiple positively charged nature, as well as the potential synergistic effect of the Cu(I) and Pt(II) metal ions, the cyclic bis[2]catenanes display broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. This work not only provides an efficient strategy for the construction of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes but also explores their applications as superior antibacterial agents, which will promote the construction of advanced supramolecular structures for biomedical applications.

         <title>Scalable and Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Polycyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons has been proposed. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate that the selectivity is attributed to combined effects of in situ released protons during anodic oxidation and significant differences in H+ mobility among various solvents.







Abstract
The reduction of aromatic compounds constitutes a fundamental and ongoing area of investigation. The selective reduction of polycyclic aromatic compounds to give either fully or partially reduced products remains a challenge, especially in applications to complex molecules at scale. Herein, we present a selective electrochemical hydrogenation of polycyclic arenes conducted under mild conditions. A noteworthy achievement of this approach is the ability to finely control both the complete and partial reduction of specific aromatic rings within polycyclic arenes by judiciously varying the reaction solvents. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the pivotal role played by in situ proton generation and interface regulation in governing reaction selectivity. The reductive electrochemical conditions show a very high level of functional&#8208;group tolerance. Furthermore, this methodology represents an easily scalable reduction (demonstrated by the reduction of 1&#8197;kg scale starting material) using electrochemical flow chemistry to give key intermediates for the synthesis of specific drugs.

Abstract
Molecular solar thermal systems (MOST) represent an auspicious solution for the storage of solar energy. We report silver salts as a unique class of catalysts, capable of releasing the stored energy from the promising 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine based MOST system. Mechanistic investigations provided insights into the silver catalyzed thermal backreaction, concurrently unveiling the first crystal structure of a 2&#8208;aza&#8208;3&#8208;borabicyclo[2.2.0]hex&#8208;5&#8208;ene, the Dewar isomer of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine. Quantification of activation energies by kinetic experiments has elucidated the advantageous energy change associated with Lewis acid catalysts, a phenomenon corroborated through computational analysis. By means of low temperature NMR spectroscopy, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Ag+ to the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine were gained.

We report silver salts as a unique class of catalysts, capable of releasing the stored energy from the promising 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborinine based MOST system. Mechanistic investigations provided insights into the silver catalyzed thermal backreaction, concurrently unveiling the first crystal structure of a 2-aza-3-borabicyclo[2.2.0]hex-5-ene, the Dewar isomer of 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborinine. Quantification of activation energies by kinetic experiments has elucidated the advantageous energy change associated with Lewis acid catalysts, a phenomenon corroborated through computational analysis. By means of low temperature NMR spectroscopy, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborinine were gained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Asymmetric Coumarin&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate as Efficient Fullerene&#8208;Free Acceptor for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;band gap coumarin&#8208;anthracene&#8208;based D&#8208;A dyad was designed and synthesized. The molecule when applied as an acceptor into PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF blend exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.91&#8201;% in ternary organic solar cells.







Abstract
Asymmetric wide&#8208;band gap fullerene&#8208;free acceptors (FFAs) play a crucial role in organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized a simple asymmetric coumarin&#8208;anthracene conjugate named CA&#8208;CN with optical band gap of 2.1&#8197;eV in a single&#8208;step condensation reaction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis confirms various multiple intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. The molecular orbital energy levels of CA&#8208;CN estimated from cyclic voltammetry were found to be suitable for its use as an acceptor for OSCs. Binary OSCs fabricated using CA&#8208;CN as acceptor and PTB7&#8208;Th as the donor achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.13&#8201;%. We further demonstrate that the insertion of 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of CA&#8208;CN as a third component in ternary OSCs with PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF as the host material achieved an impressive PCE of 14.91&#8201;%, an improvement of ~43&#8201;% compared to the PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF binary device (10.38&#8201;%). Importantly, the ternary blend enhances the absorption coverage from 400 to 800&#8197;nm and improves the morphology of the active layer. The findings highlight the efficacy of an asymmetric design approach for FFAs, which paves the way for developing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs at low cost.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Performance Cobalt&#8208;Based Environmental Catalysts from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Unveiling Overlooked Roles of Copper and Aluminum from Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of trace metals from current collectors on the activity of environmental catalysts converted from spent LIBs was revealed by a Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Al and Cu from current collectors could tune the d&#8208;band centre of active sites, leading to improved conductivity and strengthened chemisorption ability toward reactants, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of environmental catalysts converted from spent LIBs.







Abstract
Converting spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials into environmental catalysts has drawn more and more attention. Herein, we fabricated a Co3O4&#8208;based catalyst from spent LiCoO2 LIBs (Co3O4&#8208;LIBs) and found that the role of Al and Cu from current collectors on its performance is nonnegligible. The density functional theory calculations confirmed that the doping of Al and/or Cu upshifts the d&#8208;band center of Co. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was adopted to evaluate its activity. Interestingly, Al doping strengthened chemisorption for PMS (from &#8722;2.615&#8197;eV to &#8722;2.623&#8197;eV) and shortened Co&#8722;O bond length (from 2.540&#8197;&#197; to 2.344&#8197;&#197;) between them, whereas Cu doping reduced interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance (from 28.347&#8197;k&#937; to 6.689&#8197;k&#937;) excepting for the enhancement of the above characteristics. As expected, the degradation activity toward bisphenol A of Co3O4&#8208;LIBs (0.523&#8197;min&#8722;1) was superior to that of Co3O4 prepared from commercial CoC2O4 (0.287&#8197;min&#8722;1). Simultaneously, the reasons for improved activity were further verified by comparing activity with catalysts doped Al and/or Cu into Co3O4. This work reveals the role of elements from current collectors on the performance of functional materials from spent LIBs, which is beneficial to the sustainable utilization of spent LIBs.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadienes by Birch Reduction in the Presence of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete change in regioselectivity has been observed during the Birch reduction of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds. Alkyl aldehydes afford exclusively 1,4&#8208;isomers, whereas with ketones and aryl aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are isolated in good yields on a large scale. Such compounds are suitable precursors for further transformations.







Abstract
Birch reductions are well&#8208;known transformations of arenes, applied for large scale synthesis of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Herein, we describe first reactions of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds, affording aldol products in moderate to high yields. Alkyl aldehydes give the expected nonconjugated dienes by reaction at the &#945;&#8208;position. Interestingly, the intermediately formed enolate attacks aryl aldehydes and ketones from its &#947;&#8208;position, which can be explained by steric hindrance. This opens the door for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes, which are not accessible by classical Birch reductions. Our method is applicable to benzoic, m&#8208; and p&#8208;toluic acid and various carbonyl compounds, and more than 25 new products were isolated in up to 93&#8201;% yield. Prochiral aryl aldehydes afford diastereomeric mixtures in ratios of about 4&#8201;:&#8201;1, but in the cyclohexadiene ring only trans isomers are formed with high selectivity. Finally, the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are suitable precursors for further transformations, which we have demonstrated in first examples. Thus, aromatization affords products of a formal meta selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and four new stereocenters were generated by cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with excellent selectivity.

         <title>Cover Picture: Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative mechanism for amine grafting in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Carlos Mart&#237;&#8208;Gastaldo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402973). The image shows in a Warholian style how the adaptable response of the framework allows the rearrangement of pore windows necessary to enable the translocation and binding of tetraamines inside cavities that would otherwise be inaccessible. This behaviour is activated by the dynamic response of the heterometallic Ti2Ca2 clusters in MUV&#8208;10 in the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules.

Herein is reported an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines by electrophilic amination of sulfenamides with enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridines. The enantioenriched sulfinamidines show remarkable chemical and configurational stability against high temperature, acids, and bases in non&#8208;aqueous solution. One&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides is further demonstrated by employing enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.







Abstract
Sulfinamidines are promising aza&#8208;SIV chiral building blocks in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery. However, no report has documented their enantioselective synthesis. Here we present an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines via electrophilic amination of sulfenamides using an enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine. The resulting enantiomerically enriched primary sulfinamidines are configurationally stable at 90&#8201;&#176;C in solution and show remarkable stability against organic acids and bases under non&#8208;aqueous conditions. We also demonstrate a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides using N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.

         <title>Strong Swelling and Symmetrization in Siliceous Zeolites due to Hydrogen Insertion at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to other atoms or molecules, H2 enters both the pores and the framework cages of siliceous zeolites under high pressure. This results in strong swelling and symmetrization of the structures with very high hydrogen contents of 1.5&#8211;1.7 H2 molecules/SiO2 unit being obtained.







Abstract
Hydrogen and helium saturate the 1D pore systems of the high&#8208;silica (Si/Al&gt;30) zeolites Theta&#8208;One (TON), and Mobile&#8208;Twelve (MTW) at high pressure based on x&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations. In TON, a strong 22&#8201;% volume increase occurs above 5&#8197;GPa with a transition from the collapsed P21 to a symmetrical, swelled Cmc21 form linked to an increase in H2 content from 12 H2/unit cell in the pores to 35 H2/unit cell in the pores and in the framework of the material. No transition and continuous collapse of TON is observed in helium indicating that the mechanism of H2 insertion is distinct from other fluids. The insertion of hydrogen in the larger pores of MTW results in a strong 11&#8201;% volume increase at 4.3&#8197;GPa with partial symmetrization followed by a second volume increase of 4.5&#8201;% at 7.5&#8197;GPa, corresponding to increases in hydrogen content from 43 to 67 and then to 93 H2/unit cell. Flexible 1D siliceous zeolites have a very high H2 capacity (1.5 and 1.7 H2/SiO2 unit for TON and MTW, respectively) due to H2 insertion in the pores and the framework, in contrast to other atoms and molecules, thereby providing a mechanism for strong swelling.

         <dc:description>
MOF&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics achieving an unprecedented combination of high chemical robustness, excellent ferroelectricity and long&#8208;lived afterglow emission are reported by Chi Zhang, Honghan Fei et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407102). The strategy emphasizes the importance of high structural integrity in designing high&#8208;Curie temperature ferroelectrics, and the covalent interactions facilitate the photoinduced electron transfer to achieve long&#8208;lived phosphorescence.

         <title>Modulating the Microenvironments of&#160;Robust Metal Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are outstanding candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, most of reported HOFs suffer from poor stability and photocatalytic activity in the absence of Pt cocatalyst. Herein, a series of metal HOFs (Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X, X = COOMe, Br, tBu and OMe) have been rationally constructed based on dinuclear cobalt complexes, which exhibit exceptional stability in the presence of strong acid (12 M HCl) and strong base (5 M NaOH) for at least 10 days. More impressively, by varying the &#8208;X groups of the dinuclear cobalt complexes, the microenvironment of Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X can be modulated, giving rise to obviously di&#64256;erent photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#8208;X group sequence of &#8208;COOMe &gt; &#8208;Br &gt; &#8208;tBu &gt; &#8208;OMe. The optimized Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;COOMe shows H2 generation rate up to 12.8 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers and cocatalysts, which is superior to most reported Pt&#8208;assisted photocatalytic systems. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8208;X groups grafted on Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X possess different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, thus regulating the electronic structures of Co catalytic centres and proton activation barrier for H2 production, and leading to the distinctly di&#64256;erent photocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double Twisted Nanographene with a Contorted Pyrene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mature synthetic methodologies enable us to rationally design and produce chiral nanographenes (NGs), most of which consist of multiple helical motifs. However, inherent chirality originating from twisted geometry has just emerged to be employed in chiral NGs. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive chiral NG constituted of orthogonally arranged two&#8208;fold twisted &#960;&#8208;skeletons at a contorted pyrene core&#160;which contributes to optical transitions of S0&#160;&#8594;&#160;S1&#160;and vice versa. The thus&#8208;obtained NG exhibited a robustness on its redox properties through 2e&#8211;&#160;uptake/release. The chemical oxidation generated stable radical cation whose absorption covers near&#8208;infrared I and II regions. Overall, the contorted pyrene core governs electronic nature of the chiral NG. The twist operation on NGs would be, therefore, a design strategy to alter conventional chirality induction on NGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s for Potential Alternatives to Engineering Plastic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facile fabrication, low material complexity and closed&#8208;loop recycling are essential for polymer plastics to alter their linear product economy towards a cradle&#8208;to&#8208;cradle one. Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are one way to achieve that, which intrinsically exhibit decent mechanical properties of the thermosets but could also be easily recycled like the thermoplastics. In this work, we introduce rigid ester structural motifs into dynamic poly(disulfide)s to form a series of dual polymer networks. Owning to the coherence of soft/rigid segments and the reversible sacrificial crosslinking, they exhibit tailorable properties and good resistance towards different chemicals. Their closed&#8208;loop recycling is achieved via mild solvolysis, maintaining materials&#8217; mechanical integrities. It offers a solution as a sustainable replacement for engineering plastics which are massively under production but hard to be recycled.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupled Electron&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Transfer Processes at a Liquid/Liquid Interface Decorated with Photoactive Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of the ion transfer on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions was studied on the surface of hyperbranched semiconducting BiVO4 particles spontaneously adsorbed at the liquid&#8208;liquid (L/L) interface between an aqueous LiCl solution and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)borate (BATB) in 1,2&#8208;dichlorethane. The organic electrolyte was supplemented with [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 to accept photoexcited electrons from BiVO4 under formation of the corresponding Co(II) complex. The L/L interface was stabilized at the orifice of a micropipette (MP) and allowed to record ion transfer cyclic voltammetry (ITCV) by applying a Galvani potential difference &#8710;aq/oj between two reference electrodes in the electrolyte solutions and was intermittently illuminated with visible light (l &gt; 420 nm). The photogenerated holes caused oxidation of water to O2. Co(II) and O2 were detected at constant &#8710;aq/oj at an amperometric microelectrode (ME) facing the orifice of the MP in either the organic or the aqueous electrolyte. The overall current exhibits a photocurrent only in the &#8710;aq/oj&#8208;range, in which the IT of PF6&#8208; is kinetically limited. The amperometric detection of photogenerated products followed the same pattern as the photocurrent in the total current.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: from Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Carbooxygenation for the Construction of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Centers: Application to the Synthesis of Hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategic design for the construction of contiguous tetrasubstituted carbons represents a daunting challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational investigation aimed at developing catalytic aerobic carbooxygenation, involving the intramolecular addition of tertiary radicals to geminally di&#8208;substituted&#8208;alkenes followed by aerobic oxygenation. This reaction provides a&#160;straightforward route to various &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones, which can be readily transformed into hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones through allylation/translactonization. Computational analysis reveals that the key mechanistic foundation for achieving the developed aerobic carbooxygenation involves the design of endothermic (energetically uphill) C&#8211;C bond formation followed by exothermic (energetically downhill) oxygenation. Furthermore, we highlight a unique fluorine&#8208; induced stereoelectronic effect that stabilizes the endothermic stereo&#8208;determining transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Fast Potassium Ion Kinetics: High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;life Potassium Dual&#8208;ion Battery for Operation at &#8208;60&#8451;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy storage devices operating at low temperatures are plagued by sluggish kinetics, reduced capacity, and notorious dendritic growth. Herein, novel potassium dual&#8208;ion batteries (PDIBs) capable of superior performance at &#8208;60&#176;C, and fabricated by combining MXenes and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as the anode and cathode, respectively, are presented. Additionally, the reason for the anomalous kinetics of K+ (faster at low temperature than at room temperature) on the Ti3C2 anode is investigated. Theoretical calculations, crossover experiments, and in&#8208;situ XRD at room and low temperatures revealed that K+ tends to bind with solvent molecules rather than anions at subzero temperatures, which not only inhibits the participation of PF6&#8208; in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), but also guarantees co&#8208;intercalation behavior and suppresses undesirable K+ storage. The advantageous properties at low temperatures endow the Ti3C2 anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures. The PDIBs exhibit superior rate capability and high capacity retention at &#8208;40&#176;C and &#8208;60&#176;C. Impressively, after charging&#8208;discharging for 20,000 cycles at &#8208;60&#176;C, the PDIB retained 86.7% of its initial capacity. This study reveals the influence of temperatures on MXenes and offers a unique design for dual&#8208;ion batteries operating at ultralow temperatures.</dc:description>

Additionally, the reason for the anomalous kinetics of K+ (faster at low temperature than at room temperature) on the Ti3C2 anode is investigated.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction reactions, as cathodic processes in many energy&#8208;related devices, significantly impact the overall efficiency determined mainly by the performance of electrocatalysts. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) derived carbon&#8208;supported metal materials have become one of star electrocatalysts due to their tunable structure and composition through ligand design and metal screening. However, for different electroreduction reactions, the required active metal species vary in phase component, electronic state, and catalytic center configuration, hence requiring effective customization. From this perspective, this review comprehensively analyzes the structural design principles, metal loading strategies, practical electroreduction performance, and complex catalytic mechanisms, thereby providing insights and guidance for the future rational design of such electroreduction catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce a novel intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction that efficiently yields azetidine, oxetane, and indoline derivatives through a mechanism resembling the carbon analogue of the Norrish&#8211;Yang reaction. This process is facilitated by excited triplet&#8208;state carbon&#8208;centered biradicals, enabling the 1,5&#8208;HAT reaction&#160;by suppressing the critical 1,4&#8208;biradical intermediates from undergoing the Norrish Type II cleavage reaction, and pioneering unprecedented 1,6&#8208;HAT reactions initiated by excited triplet&#8208;state alkenes. We demonstrate the synthetic utility and compatibility of this method across various functional groups, validated through scope evaluation, large&#8208;scale synthesis, and derivatization. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling, kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8208;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8208;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8208;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8208;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8208;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945; = 0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Paired Electrolysis Enables Reductive Heck Coupling of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Among various methods to construct Csp2&#8211;Csp3 bonds, the reductive Heck reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes stands out due to its potential efficiency and broad substrate availability. However, traditional reductive Heck reactions are limited by the use of precious metal catalysts and/or limited aryl halide and alkene compatibility. Here, we present an electrochemically mediated, metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free reductive Heck reaction that tolerates both unactivated (hetero)aryl halides and diverse alkenes such as vinyl boronates and silanes. Detailed electrochemical and deuterium&#8208;labeling studies support that this transformation likely proceeds through a paired electrolysis pathway, in which acid generated by the oxidation of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) at the anode intercepts an alkyl carbanion formed after radical&#8208;polar crossover at the cathode. As such, this approach offers a sustainable method for the construction of Csp2&#8211;Csp3 bonds from (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes, paving the way for the development of other electrochemically mediated olefin difunctionalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Photochemical C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated bis(diiminopyridine)cobalt complex enables the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles with chloro&#8208; and bromoarenes. Spectroscopic and computational studies elucidate the photoelectron transfer processes of the metal complex with triethylamine and a bromoarene, suggesting that electron transfer is facilitated by a preassembly of these molecules with the complex.







Abstract
Precious metal complexes remain ubiquitous in photoredox catalysis (PRC) despite concerted efforts to find more earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and replacements based on 3d metals in particular. Most otherwise plausible 3d metal complexes are assumed to be unsuitable due to short&#8208;lived excited states, which has led researchers to prioritize the pursuit of longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes through careful molecular design. However, we report herein that the C&#8722;H arylation of pyrroles and related substrates (which are benchmark reactions for assessing the efficacy of photoredox catalysts) can be achieved using a simple and readily accessible octahedral bis(diiminopyridine) cobalt complex, [1&#8208;Co](PF6)2. Notably, [1&#8208;Co]2+ efficiently functionalizes both chloro&#8208; and bromoarene substrates despite the short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the key photoexcited intermediate *[1&#8208;Co]2+ (8&#8197;ps). We present herein the scope of this C&#8722;H arylation protocol and provide mechanistic insights derived from detailed spectroscopic and computational studies. These indicate that, despite its transient existence, reduction of *[1&#8208;Co]2+ is facilitated via pre&#8208;assembly with the NEt3 reductant, highlighting an alternative strategy for the future development of 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed PRC.

         <title>Direct &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acid Loading onto a Bacterial Thiotemplate Assembly Line via a Multienzyme Gateway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular warhead for the virulence factor malleicyprol derives from trigonic acid, a cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid. Its incorporation involves an incomplete nonribosomal peptide synthetase module and two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, an adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme and an FkbH&#8208;like enzyme for translocation. The mechanism for the direct loading of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids may inspire synthetic biology and antivirulence approaches.







Abstract
Various nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) create structural and functional diversity by incorporating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids into peptide backbones. Trigonic acid, an unusual cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid, is the source of the molecular warhead of malleicyprol, a critical virulence factor of human and animal pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group. The process of selecting and loading this building block remained enigmatic as the NRPS module designated for this task is incomplete. Using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational analyses, targeted metabolomics, and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that two trans&#8208;acting enzymes are required to load this central building block onto the modular assembly line. An adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme (BurJ) activates trigonic acid, followed by the translocation of the enzyme&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid thioester by an FkbH&#8208;like protein with a mutated phosphatase domain (BurH). This specialized gateway is the first reported direct loading of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid onto a bona fide NRPS module in bacteria and expands the synthetic biology toolbox for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of non&#8208;canonical building blocks. Moreover, insight into the biochemical basis of virulence factor biosynthesis can provide a foundation for developing enzyme inhibitors as anti&#8208;virulence therapeutics against BP pathogen infections.

         <title>Alkene 1,3&#8208;Difluorination via Transient Oxonium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a diastereoselective hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers. The transformation proceeds through a transiently formed oxonium intermediate that is opened by fluoride to rearrange an alkyl chain. The protocol is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain. Mechanistic studies reveal key insights into the reaction selectivity.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under&#8208;explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanohoops: A New Generation of Curved Materials for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different nanohoops used to date in organic electronics are described in this Review. Through a structure&#8208;properties relationship study, the different performances reached are analysed and the potential of this new generation of curved materials discussed. This Review aims to stimulate future molecular designs of functional materials based on these conjugated macrocycles.







Abstract
Nanohoops, cyclic association of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems to form a hoop&#8208;shaped molecule, have been widely developed in the last 15&#8197;years. Beyond the synthetic challenge, the strong interest towards these molecules arises from their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals, which provide singular properties to these fascinating structures. Thanks to their particular cylindrical arrangement, this new generation of curved molecules have been already used in many applications such as host&#8211;guest complexation, biosensing, bioimaging, solid&#8208;state emission and catalysis. However, their potential in organic electronics has only started to be explored. From the first incorporation as an emitter in a fluorescent organic light emitting diode (OLED), to the recent first incorporation as a host in phosphorescent OLEDs or as charge transporter in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and in organic photovoltaics, this field has shown important breakthroughs in recent years. These findings have revealed that curved materials can play a key role in the future and can even be more efficient than their linear counterparts. This can have important repercussions for the future of electronics. Time has now come to overview the different nanohoops used to date in electronic devices in order to stimulate the future molecular designs of functional materials based on these macrocycles.

         <title>A Gold(I)&#8211;Acetylene Complex Synthesised using Single&#8208;Crystal Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of &#960;&#8208;acetylene gold(I) compounds as intermediates in catalysis has been postulated, but their isolation or spectroscopic detection has remained elusive. Herein, the combination of a bulky cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine along with single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactivity allowed for the isolation of the first gold(I)&#8211;acetylene complex, which was thoroughly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR, periodic DFT, and electronic structure analyses.







Abstract
Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal solid/gas reactivity the gold(I) acetylene complex [Au(L1)(&#951;2&#8208;HC&#8801;CH)][BArF4] is cleanly synthesized by addition of acetylene gas to single crystals of [Au(L1)(CO)][BArF4] [L1=tris&#8208;2&#8208;(4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbiphenyl)phosphine, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3]. This simplest gold&#8208;alkyne complex has been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and periodic DFT. Bonding of HC&#8801;CH with [Au(L1)]+ comprises both &#963;&#8208;donation and &#960;&#8208;backdonation with additional dispersion interactions within the cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Tune Molecular Orientations to Enable Dual Passivation in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientation, enhancing its interaction with surface defects. Consequently, this led to the successful fabrication of a stable inverted device with an impressive PCE of 25&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nonradiative recombination losses occurring at the interface pose a significant obstacle to achieve high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in inverted PSCs. Passivating surface defects using molecules with different functional groups represents one of the key strategies for enhancing PSCs efficiency. However, a lack of insight into the passivation orientation of molecules on the surface is a challenge for rational molecular design. In this study, aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains but identical electron&#8208;donating (&#8722;SH) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#8722;NH3+) groups were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientations, which facilitating stronger interactions with the surface defects through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding. The resultant perovskite films following defect passivation demonstrate reduced ion migration, inhibition of nonradiative recombination, and more n&#8208;type characteristics for efficient electron transfer. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% was achieved, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 500&#8197;hours of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Photodetector with High Operational Stability Using Self&#8208;Trapped Cs3Cu2I5 Interfacial Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals transport layer has been embedded in photodiode structures to simultaneously realize bias&#8208;switchable organic photodetectors exhibiting photovoltaic (0&#8197;V) and photomultiplication operating modes (1&#8197;V) with fast response speed, remarkable stability and broad to different organic systems, indicating a versatile strategy for future integrated organic optoelectronic scenarios.







Abstract
Conventional photovoltaic (PV)&#8208;photodetectors are hard to detect fainted signals, while photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;capable devices indispensable for detecting weak light and are prone to degrade under strong light illumination and large bias, and it is urgent to realize highly efficient integrated detecting system with both PM and PV operation modes. In this work, one lead&#8208;free Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals with self&#8208;trapping exciton nature was introduced as interfacial layer adjacent to bulk and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer heterojunction structure, and corresponding organic photodetectors with bias&#8208;switchable dual modes are demonstrated. The fabricated device exhibits low operating bias (0&#8197;V for PV mode and 0.8&#8197;V for PM mode), high specific detectivity (~1013&#8197;Jones), fast response speed as low as 1.59&#8197;&#956;s, large bandwidth over 0.2&#8197;MHz and long&#8208;term operational stability last for 4&#8197;months in ambient condition. This synergy strategy also validated in different materials and device architectures, providing a convenient and scalable production process to develop highly efficient bias&#8208;switchable multi&#8208;functional organic optoelectrical applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomatization of Pyridinium Salts by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;Selective Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C4&#8208;selective addition of soft copper&#8208;based silicon nucleophiles to pyridinium triflates allows for their enantioselective deraromatization in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (see scheme; (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE=1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane). The thus&#8208;formed &#945;&#8208;chiral silyl unit can be further used to control the stereoselectivity in subsequent transformations.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective addition of silicon nucleophiles released from an Si&#8722;B reagent to prochiral pyridinium triflates is reported. The dearomatization proceeds with excellent enantioselectivity using Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 as the precatalyst and (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE (1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane) as the chiral ligand. A carbonyl group at C3 is required for this, likely acting a weak donor group to preorganize and direct the nucleophilic attack towards C4. The resulting 4&#8208;silylated 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines can be further converted into functionalized piperidine derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;A C4-selective addition of soft copper-based silicon nucleophiles to pyridinium triflates allows for their enantioselective deraromatization in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (see scheme; (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Ph-BPE=1,2-bis[(2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-2,5-diphenylphospholan-1-yl]ethane). The thus-formed &#945;-chiral silyl unit can be further used to control the stereoselectivity in subsequent transformations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed C4-selective addition of silicon nucleophiles released from an Si&#8722;B reagent to prochiral pyridinium triflates is reported. The dearomatization proceeds with excellent enantioselectivity using Cu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as the precatalyst and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Ph-BPE (1,2-bis[(2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-2,5-diphenylphospholan-1-yl]ethane) as the chiral ligand. A carbonyl group at C3 is required for this, likely acting a weak donor group to preorganize and direct the nucleophilic attack towards C4. The resulting 4-silylated 1,4-dihydropyridines can be further converted into functionalized piperidine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Selective Dissolution of Coinage Metals in Recyclable Ionic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au can be sequentially dissolved from waste electrical and electronic equipment using green oxidants: aqueous H2O2 and Oxone in biomass&#8208;derived sustainable and recyclable ionic media: lactic acid and deep eutectic solvent made of choline chloride and urea. This sequential one metal &#8211; one method recycling approach closely follows efforts for the security of supply and objectives of circular economy and sustainable development.







Abstract
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au are essential for modern electronics and their recycling from waste materials is becoming increasingly important to guarantee the security of their supply. Designing new sustainable and selective procedures that would substitute currently used processes is crucial. Here, we describe an unprecedented approach for the sequential dissolution of single metals from Cu, Ag, and Au mixtures using biomass&#8208;derived ionic solvents and green oxidants. First, Cu can be selectively dissolved in the presence of Ag and Au with a choline chloride/urea/H2O2 mixture, followed by the dissolution of Ag in lactic acid/H2O2. Finally, the metallic Au, which is not soluble in either solution above, is dissolved in choline chloride/urea/Oxone. Subsequently, the metals were simply and quantitatively recovered from dissolutions, and the solvents were recycled and reused. The applicability of the developed approach was demonstrated by recovering metals from electronic waste substrates such as printed circuit boards, gold fingers, and solar panels. The dissolution reactions and selectivity were explored with different analytical techniques and DFT calculations. We anticipate our approach will pave a new way for the contemporary and sustainable recycling of multi&#8208;metal waste substrates.

         <title>Industrial&#8208;Scale Hard Carbon Designed to Regulate Electrochemical Polarization for Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile but scalable strategy to decrease electrochemical polarization by accurately regulating multiple structural features for industrial&#8208;scale hard carbon enabling rapid sodium storage is proposed via adjusting the components of precursors.







Abstract
Given the merits of abundant resource, low cost and high electrochemical activity, hard carbons have been regarded as one of the most commercializable anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, poor rate capability is one of the main obstacles that severely hinder its further development. In addition, the relationships between preparation method, material structure and electrochemical performance have not been clearly elaborated. Herein, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to accurately construct the multiple structural features in hard carbon via adjusting the components of precursors. Through detailed physical characterization of the hard carbons derived from different regulation steps, and further combined with in&#8208;situ Raman and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analysis, the network of multiple relationships between preparation method, microstructure, sodium storage behavior and electrochemical performance have been successfully established. Simultaneously, exceptional rate capability about 108.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 have been achieved from RHC sample with high reversible capacity and desirable initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Additionally, the practical applications can be extended to cylindrical battery with excellent cycle behaviors. Such facile approach can provide guidance for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;performance hard carbons and provides the possibility of building practical SIBs with high energy density and durability.

         <title>Influence of Donor Skeleton on Intramolecular Electron Transfer Amount for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We multidimensionally reveal the relationship between passivation strength of organic passivator on perovskite film and the spin&#8208;state electronic structure of intermediate donor skeleton. Agreeing well with the calculated amounts of transferred electron between D&#8722;A pairs, the best benzene&#8208;amide pair delivers a champion efficiency of 15.51&#8201;% for carbon&#8208;based, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell and 24.20&#8201;% in an inverted (Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9)Pb(I0.93Br0.07)3 cell.







Abstract
The passivation of the defects derived from rapid&#8208;crystallization with electron&#8208;donating molecules is always a prerequisite to obtain desirable perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells, thus, the in&#8208;depth understanding on the correlations between molecular structure and passivation capacity is of great importance for screening passivators. Here, we introduce the double&#8208;ended amide molecule into perovskite precursor solution to modulate crystallization process and passivate defects. By regulating the intermediate bridging skeletons with alkyl, alkenyl and benzene groups, the results show the passivation strength highly depends on the spin&#8208;state electronic structure that serves as an intrinsic descriptor to determine the intramolecular charge distribution by controlling orbital electron transfer from the donor segment to acceptor segment. Upon careful optimization, the benzene&#8208;bridged amide molecule demonstrates superior efficacy on improving perovskite film quality. As a physical proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the carbon&#8208;based, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell delivers a significantly increased efficiency of 15.51&#8201;% with a remarkably improved stability. Based on the same principle, a champion efficiency of 24.20&#8201;% is further obtained on the inverted (Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9)Pb(I0.93Br0.07)3 solar cell. These findings provide new fundamental insights into the influence of spin&#8208;state modulation on effective perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Leveraging DNA&#8208;Encoded Cell&#8208;Mimics for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Transmembrane Channel Release&#8208;Induced Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimics model (ARTC) that effectively mimics the behavior of natural T cells and establishes physicochemical interactions with biological cells. ARTC induce cellular apoptosis by releasing transmembrane channels that respond to the mildly acidic microenvironment, leading to selective outflow of intracellular potassium ions and consequent potent cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
The advancement of cell&#8208;mimic materials, which can forge sophisticated physicochemical dialogues with living cells, has unlocked a realm of intriguing prospects within the fields of synthetic biology and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the evolutionarily acquired ability of T lymphocytes to release perforin and generate transmembrane channels on targeted cells for killing, herein we present a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimic model (ARTC) that accurately mimics T&#8208;cell&#8208;like behavior. ARTC responds to acidic conditions similar to those found in the tumor microenvironment and then selectively releases a G&#8208;rich DNA strand (LG4) embedded with C12 lipid and cholesterol molecules. Once released, LG4 effectively integrates into the membranes of neighboring live cells, behaving as an artificial transmembrane channel that selectively transports K+ ions and disrupts cellular homeostasis, ultimately inducing apoptosis. We hope that the emergence of ARTC will usher in new perspectives for revolutionizing future disease treatment and catalyzing the development of advanced biomedical technologies.

A bioinspired tetranuclear manganese complex with a cubane structure has been developed to electrocatalyze water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. This complex demonstrates an optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87&#8201;%, which is amongst (if not) the highest FE(H2O2) of reported homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Stable homogeneous two&#8208;electron water oxidation electrocatalysts are highly demanded to understand the precise mechanism and reaction intermediates of electrochemical H2O2 production. Here we report a tetranuclear manganese complex with a cubane structure which can electrocatalyze water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide under alkaline and neutral conditions. Such a complex demonstrates an optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87&#8201;%, which is amongst (if not) the highest FE(H2O2) of reported homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts. In addition, active species were identified and co&#8208;catalysts were excluded through ESI&#8208;MS characterization. Furthermore, we identified water binding sites and isolated one&#8208;electron oxidation intermediate by chemical oxidation of the catalyst in the presence of water substrates. It is evident that efficient proton&#8208;accepting electrolytes avoid rapid proton building&#8208;up at electrode and substantially improve reaction rate and selectivity. Accordingly, we propose a two&#8208;electron catalytic cycle model for water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide with the bioinspired molecular electrocatalyst. The present work is expected to provide an ideal platform to elucidate the two&#8208;electron WOR mechanism at the atomic level.

         <title>Scalable Precise Nanofilm Coating and Gradient Al Doping Enable Stable Battery Cycling of LiCoO2 at 4.7&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The overgrowth of surface CEI and the irreversible phase transition from H1&#8211;3 to O1 are the primary causes of LiCoO2 cathode degradation at 4.7&#8197;V. These phenomena can be significantly suppressed by employing an ultrathin, dense LiAlO2 surface coating and Al gradient doping, which enables a stable cycling of LiCoO2 at 4.7&#8197;V.







Abstract
The quest for smart electronics with higher energy densities has intensified the development of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 (LCO). Despite their potential, LCO materials operating at 4.7&#8197;V faces critical challenges, including interface degradation and structural collapse. Herein, we propose a collective surface architecture through precise nanofilm coating and doping that combines an ultra&#8208;thin LiAlO2 coating layer and gradient doping of Al. This architecture not only mitigates side reactions, but also improves the Li+ migration kinetics on the LCO surface. Meanwhile, gradient doping of Al inhibited the severe lattice distortion caused by the irreversible phase transition of O3&#8722;H1&#8722;3&#8722;O1, thereby enhanced the electrochemical stability of LCO during 4.7&#8197;V cycling. DFT calculations further revealed that our approach significantly boosts the electronic conductivity. As a result, the modified LCO exhibited an outstanding reversible capacity of 230&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4.7&#8197;V, which is approximately 28&#8201;% higher than the conventional capacity at 4.5&#8197;V. To demonstrate their practical application, our cathode structure shows improved stability in full pouch cell configuration under high operating voltage. LCO exhibited an excellent cycling stability, retaining 82.33&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 4.5&#8197;V. This multifunctional surface modification strategy offers a viable pathway for the practical application of LCO materials, setting a new standard for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;lasting electrode materials.

         <title>mRNA Display in Cell Lysates Enables Identification of Cyclic Peptides Targeting the BRD3 Extraterminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>mRNA display is a powerful technology to screen libraries of &gt;1012 cyclic peptides against a protein target, enabling the rapid discovery of high affinity ligands. These cyclic peptides are particularly well suited to challenging protein targets that have been difficult to drug with small molecules. However, target choice can still be limited as screens are typically performed against purified proteins which often demands the use of isolated domains and precludes the use of aggregation&#8208;prone targets. Here, we report a method to perform mRNA display selections in mammalian cell lysates without the need for prior target purification, vastly expanding the potential target scope of mRNA display. We have applied the methodology to identify low to sub&#8208;nanomolar peptide binders for two targets: a NanoLuc subunit (LgBiT) and full&#8208;length bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 3 (BRD3). Our cyclic peptides for BRD3 were found to bind to the extraterminal (ET) domain of BRD3 and the closely related BRD proteins, BRD2 and BRD4. While many chemical probes exist for the bromodomains of BRD proteins, the ET domain is relatively underexplored, making these peptides valuable additions to the BRD toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective cleavage of C &#946; &#8208;O&#8208;4 bond for lignin depolymerization via paired&#8208;electrolysis in an undivided cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8208;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8208;H/N&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage.</dc:description>

         <title>P,N&#8208;Coordinating Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (NYPhos): A Ligand Platform for the Selective Monoarylation of Small Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of small nucleophiles are of great interest, but challenging due to difficulties in selectivity control. Herein, we report the development of a new platform of P,N&#8208;ligands consisting of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines with aminophosphonium groups (NYPhos) to address this challenge. These phosphine ligands are easily accessible in a wide structural diversity with highly modular electronic and steric properties. Based on a family of 14 ligands the selective monoarylation of acetone as well as other challenging ketones and amides was accomplished with record&#8208;setting activities even for aryl chlorides at room temperature including late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug molecules. Moreover, ammonia and other small primary amines could be coupled at mild conditions. Isolation and structure analyses of palladium complexes within the catalytic cycle confirmed the P,N&#8208;coordination mode necessary to reach the observed selectivities and proved the facile adjustability of the N&#8208;donor strength, which is beneficial for the targeted design of tailored P,N&#8208;ligands for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence&#160;and Electroluminescence from Dual&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategy of integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptor in single molecule was proposed to construct white circularly polarized luminescence (WCPL) materials in this work. Consequently, a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers, namely (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ, were designed and synthesized, which displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands in solution and solid films at Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.30, 0.33) and (0.33, 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ exhibited high PLQY of up to 67% in doped films and obvious mirror&#8208;image WCPL signals with |glum| value of 3.0 &#215; 10&#8208;3. Moreover, white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) based on organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ as emitters were also achieved with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.37) and EQEmax of 4.7%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level of white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters. By optimizing the device structure, warm WCPEL devices were further obtained with |gEL| value of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8208;3, CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.48) and EQEmax of up to 15.6%.

Consequently, a pair of dual-emission enantiomers, namely (R/S)-DO-PTZ, were designed and synthesized, which displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual-emission bands in solution and solid films at Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.30, 0.33) and (0.33, 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, (R/S)-DO-PTZ exhibited high PLQY of up to 67% in doped films and obvious mirror-image WCPL signals with |glum| value of 3.0 &#215; 10-3. Moreover, white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) based on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with (R/S)-DO-PTZ as emitters were also achieved with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.37) and EQEmax of 4.7%, representing the state-of-the-art level of white OLEDs based on single-molecule purely organic emitters. By optimizing the device structure, warm WCPEL devices were further obtained with |gEL| value of 2.8 &#215; 10-3, CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.48) and EQEmax of up to 15.6%. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CP-WOLEDs based on single-molecule purely organic emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Gradient Solution Deposition Amends Unfavorable Band Structure of Sb2(S,Se)3 Film for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Band structure of a semiconducting film critically determines the charge separation and transport efficiency. In antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells, the hydrothermal method has achieved control of bandgap width of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film through tuning the atomic ratio of S/Se, resulting in an efficiency breakthrough towards 10%. However, the obtained band structure exhibits an unfavorable gradient distribution in terms of carrier transport, which seriously impedes the device efficiency improvement. To solve this problem, here we develop a strategy by intentionally regulating hydrothermal temperature to control the chemical reaction kinetics between S and Se sources with Sb source. This approach enables the control over vertical distribution of S/Se atomic ratio in Sb2(S,Se)3 films, forming a favorable band structure which is conducive to carrier transport. Meanwhile, the adjusted element distribution not only ensures the uniformity of grain structure, but also increases the Se content of the films and suppress sulfur vacancy defects. Ultimately, the device delivers a high efficiency of 10.55%, which is among the highest reported efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. This study provides an effective strategy towards manipulating the element distribution in mixed&#8208;anion compound films prepared by solution&#8208;based method to optimize their optical and electrical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Strained Au skin on Mesoporous Intermetallic AuCu3 Nanocoral for Electrocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia across a Wide Concentration Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) uses nitrate from wastewater, offering a hopeful solution for environmental issues and ammonia production. Yet, varying nitrate levels in real wastewater greatly affect NitRR, slowing down its multi&#8208;step process. Herein, a multi&#8208;strategy approach was explored through the design of ordered mesoporous intermetallic AuCu3 nanocorals with ultrathin Au skin (meso&#8208;i&#8208;AuCu3@ultra&#8208;Au) as an efficient and concentration&#8208;versatile catalyst for NitRR. The highly penetrated structure, coupled with the compressive stress exerted on the skin layer, not only facilitates rapid electron/mass transfer, but also effectively modulates the surface electronic structure, addressing the concentration&#8208;dependent challenges encountered in practical NitRR process. As expected, the novel catalyst demonstrates outstanding NitRR activities and Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 95% across a real and widespread concentration range (10&#8208;2000 mM). Notably, its performance at each concentration matched or exceeded that of the best&#8208;known catalyst designed for that concentration. Multiple operando spectroscopies unveiled the catalyst concurrently optimized the adsorption behavior of different intermediates (adsorbed *NOx and *H) while expediting the hydrogenation steps, leading to an efficient overall reduction process. Moreover, the catalyst also displays promising potential for use in ammonia production at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities and in conceptual zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries, serving trifunctional nitrate conversion, ammonia synthesis and power supply.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8208;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8208;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8208;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27 mAh&#183;cm&#8722;2 at 8 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000 cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Fluorinated Nanospace in Porous Organic Salts with High Water Stability/Capability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water in hydrophobic nanospaces shows specific dynamic properties different from bulk water. The investigation of these properties is important in various research fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. The elucidation of the correlation between properties of water and hydrophobic nanospaces requires nanospaces covered only with simple hydrophobic group (e.g., fluorine) without impurities such as metals. This work successfully fabricated all&#8208;organic diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs) with highly fluorinated nanospaces, wherein hydrophobic fluorine atoms are densely exposed on the void surfaces, by combining fluorine substituted triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) derivatives with tetrahedral tetrasulfonic acid. This d&#8208;POSs with a highly fluorinated nanospace significantly improved their water stability, retaining their crystal structure even when immersed in water over one week. Moreover, this highly hydrophobic and fluorinated nanospace&#160;adsorbs 160 mL(STP)/g of water vapor at Pe/P0 = 0.90; this is the first hydrophobic nanospace, which water molecules can enter, in an all&#8208;organic porous material. Furthermore, this highly fluorinated nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity (1.34 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S/cm) at 90&#176;C and 95%RH.&#160;POSs with tailorable nanospaces may significantly advance the elucidation of the properties of specific &#8220;water&#8221; in pure hydrophobic environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles through Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization Enabled by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis holds a pivotal position in modern organic synthesis, capable of inducing novel reactivities under mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions. However, the merger of photocatalysis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation as an efficient and sustainable method for the construction of chiral molecules remains elusive and challenging. Herein, we develop a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation reaction enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, providing a synergistic catalytic strategy for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with high levels of enantioselectivity (96% to &gt;99% ee). Mechanistic studies indicate that the excited photocatalyst was quenched by divalent cobalt species in the presence of Salox ligand, leading to the formation of catalytically active chiral Co(III) complex. Moreover, stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate with indole suggest that the irradiation of visible light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.</dc:description>

         <title>General In Situ Engineering of Carbon&#8208;Based Materials on Carbon Fiber for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing real&#8208;time, dynamic, and in situ analytical methods with high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial for exploring biochemical processes in the brain. Although in vivo electrochemical methods based on carbon fiber (CF) microelectrodes are effective in monitoring neurochemical dynamics during physiological and pathological processes, complex post modification hinders large&#8208;scale productions and widespread neuroscience applications. Herein, we develop a general strategy for the in situ engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials to mass&#8208;produce functional CFs by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors, followed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. This strategy demonstrates exceptional universality and design flexibility, overcoming complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoiding the delamination of the modification layer. This simplifies the fabrication and integration of functional CF&#8208;based microelectrodes. Moreover, we design highly stable and selective H+, O2, and ascorbate microsensors and monitor the influence of CO2 exposure on the O2 content of the cerebral tissue during physiological and ischemia&#8208;reperfusion pathological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;Doping Enables Significant Suppression of Conformational Relaxation and Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay for Improved Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite various efforts to optimize the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) performance of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives for bio&#8208;imaging, convenient and efficient strategies to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivatives in biological environment and the intrinsic mechanism studies are still lacking. Herein, we propose an alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR fluorescence imaging. The developed PDI derivative, OPE&#8208;PDI, shows much brighter in n&#8208;Hexane (HE) compared with that in other organic media, and the excited state dynamics investigation experimentally elucidates the solvent effect&#8208;induced suppression of intermolecular energy transfer and intramolecular nonradiative decay as the underlying mechanism for the fluorescence improvement. Theoretical calculations reveal the lowest reorganization energies of OPE&#8208;PDI in HE among various solvents, indicating the effectively suppressed conformational relaxation to support the strongest radiative decay. Inspired by this, an alkyl atmosphere mimicking HE is constructed by incorporating the octadecane into OPE&#8208;PDI&#8208;based nanoparticles, permitting up to 3&#8208;fold fluorescence improvement compared with the counterpart nanoparticles. Owing to the merits of high brightness, anti&#8208;photobleaching, and low biotoxicity for the optimal nanoparticles, they have been employed for probing and long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor. This work highlights a facile strategy for the fluorescence enhancement of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Solid Polymer Layer: From a Single Fluoropolymer to Divergent Fluorinated Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the structure and chemistry of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) underpins the stability of electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, and is crucial for advancing rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we utilized photo&#8208;controlled copolymerization to achieve the on&#8208;demand synthesis of fluorosulfonyl fluoropolymers as unprecedented artificial SEI layers on Li metal anodes. This work not only enables instant formation of a hybrid polymer&#8208;inorganic interphase that consists of a polymer&#8208;enriched top layer and a LiF&#8208;fortified bottom layer, originating from a single polymeric component, but also imparts various desirable physical properties (e.g., good mechanical strength and flexibility, high ion conductivity, low overpotential) to SEI via a single&#8208;to&#8208;divergent strategy. Model reactions and structural characterizations supported the formation of a divergent fluorinated interphase, which furnished prolonged stabilization of Li deposition, high coulombic efficiency and improved cycling behavior in electrochemical experiments. This work highlights the great potential of exploring reactive polymers as versatile coatings to stabilize Li metal anodes, providing a promising avenue to solve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial problems for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect for Catalytic Polymerization and Degradation of a Cyclobutane Monomer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations guide to unveil the electron push&#8208;pull effect in reshaping the polymerizability of non&#8208;polymerizable cyclobutane to afford densely functionalized all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as their degradation to afford alkene derivatives. Successful polymerization conditions consist of Lewis acid, Br&#248;nsted base, and a C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator, while degradation proceeds with catalytic amount of an acid.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) offers a striking solution to solve problems encountered in step&#8208;growth condensation polymerization, including precise control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and topology. This has inspired our interest in ROP of cycloalkanes with an ultimate goal to rethink polyolefins, which clearly poses a number of challenges. Practicality of ROP of cycloalkanes is actually limited by their low polymerizability and elusive mechanisms which arise from significantly varied ring size and non&#8208;polar C&#8722;C bonds in monomers. In this work, by using Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base/C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator system previously developed in our laboratory, we focus on cyclobutanes and explore the positional and electronic effects of substituents on the ring, namely electron push&#8208;pull effect, in promoting controlled polymerization to afford densely functionalized poly(cyclobutanes), as well as catalytic degradation of obtained polymers for upcycling. More importantly, experiments and DFT calculations unveil considerable population of Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;induced thermostabilized 1,4&#8208;zwitterions, which distinguish cyclobutanes from cyclopropanes and others. All these findings would shed light on catalytic synthesis and degradation of saturated all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as small molecule transformations of cyclobutanes.

         <title>A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable analogue of the iconic Chichibabin hydrocarbon was synthesized by Ullmann coupling from a readily available, chlorinated trityl radical (TTM&#8208;I). Thanks to its planar bridge, which exhibits hydrogen and chlorine atoms in just the right positions, the TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid has skyblue color in solution, emits in the NIR range but nevertheless has significant diradical character at room temperature.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules with multiple radical centers such as the iconic Chichibabin diradicaloid hold promise as building blocks in materials for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, it is a considerable challenge to design simple analogues of the Chichibabin hydrocarbon that are chemically inert, exhibit high diradical character and emit light at a distinct wavelength that may offer an optical readout of the spin state in functional ensembles. Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky&#8208;blue color and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In&#8208;depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.

Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable &lt;b&gt;TTM-TTM&lt;/b&gt; diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky-blue color and near-infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In-depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bioorthogonal Dual Fluorogenic Probe for the Live&#8208;Cell Monitoring of Nutrient Uptake by Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wang, Torres et&#8197;al. describe a probe for the live cell monitoring of nutrient uptake by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. By dually quenching a CFSE&#8208;probe that becomes fluorogenic after treatment with cytosolic esterases, and fluorescent upon reaction with strained alkenes, they could monitor uptake of fatty acids, sugars, and amino acids in primary immune cells.







Abstract
Cells rely heavily on the uptake of exogenous nutrients for survival, growth, and differentiation. Yet quantifying the uptake of small molecule nutrients at the single cell level is difficult. Here we present a new approach to studying the nutrient uptake in live single cells using Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels Alder (IEDDA) chemistry. We have modified carboxyfluorescein&#8208;diacetate&#8208;succinimidyl esters (CFSE)&#8212;a quenched fluorophore that can covalently react with proteins and is only turned on in the cytosol of a cell following esterase activity&#8212;with a tetrazine. This tetrazine serves as a second quencher for the pendant fluorophore. Upon reaction with nutrients modified with an electron&#8208;rich or strained dienophile in an IEDDA reaction, this quenching group is destroyed, thereby enabling the probe to fluoresce. This has allowed us to monitor the uptake of a variety of dienophile&#8208;containing nutrients in live primary immune cell populations using flow cytometry and live&#8208;cell microscopy.

         <title>Surface Coordination Modulated Morphological Anisotropic Engineering of Iron&#8208;Benzoquinone Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the surface coordination of carbon for morphological engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ is realized, the morphology of which evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon substrate. It exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performance for lithium storage.







Abstract
Morphological anisotropic engineering is powerful to synthesize metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with versatile physicochemical properties for diverse applications ranging from gas storage/separation to electrocatalysis and batteries, etc. Herein, we developed a carbon substrate guided strategy to manipulate the facet&#8208;dependent coordination for morphology engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ (tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) frameworks, which is built with cubic Fe octamer bridged by two parallel THBQ ligands along three orthogonal axes, extending to a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework with pcu&#8208;e network topology. The electronegative O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon surfaces compete with THBQ linkers to selectively interact with the unsaturated coordinated Fe cations on the {111} facets and inhibit crystal growth along the &lt;111&gt; direction. The morphology of Fe&#8208;THBQ evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon substrate. The Fe&#8208;THBQ with varied morphologies exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performances for electrochemical lithium storage. This work will shed light on the morphology modulation of MOFs for promising applications.

         <title>Progressive Optimization of Lanthanide Nanoparticle Scintillators for Enhanced Triple&#8208;Activated Radioluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressive optimization on lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators was performed to maximize their radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) emission intensity and reveal the underlying relationship between the scintillators&#8242; structure and RL efficiency. The results regarding the RL mechanism and in vivo multimodal imaging strongly indicated the significant potential of tailored LnNP scintillators to achieve seamlessly integrated tumor radio&#8208;phototheranostics.







Abstract
Lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators exhibit huge potential in achieving radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (radioluminescence, RL). However, their structure&#8211;activity relationship remains largely unexplored. Herein, progressive optimization of LnNP scintillators is presented to unveil their structure&#8208;dependent RL property and enhance their RL output efficiency. Benefiting from the favorable host matrix and the luminescence&#8208;protective effect of core&#8211;shell engineering, NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8201;%Eu@NaLuF4 nanoparticle scintillators with tailored structures emerged as the top candidates. Living imaging experiments based on optimal LnNP scintillators validated the feasibility of laser&#8208;free continuous RL activated by clinical radiopharmaceuticals for tumor multiplex visualization. This research provides unprecedented insights into the rational design of LnNP scintillators, which would enable efficient energy conversion from Cerenkov luminescence, &#947;&#8208;radiation, and &#946;&#8208;electrons into visible photon signals, thus establishing a robust nanotechnology&#8208;aided approach for tumor&#8208;directed radio&#8208;phototheranostics.

         <title>Ultrafast Formation of Charge Transfer Trions at Molecular&#8208;Functionalized 2D MoS2 Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trion dynamics at an organometallic molecule/monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML&#8722;MoS2) is investigated via transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. We observed an ultrafast hole transfer, followed by the formation of charge&#8208;transfer trions.







Abstract
In this work, we investigate trion dynamics occurring at the heterojunction between organometallic molecules and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. By pumping at 2.4&#8197;eV with laser pulses, we have observed an ultrafast hole transfer, succeeded by the emergence of charge&#8208;transfer trions. This observation is facilitated by the cancellation of ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals due to their opposite phases, making tr&#8208;ESFG especially sensitive to the trion formation dynamics. The presence of charge&#8208;transfer trion at molecular functionalized TMD monolayers suggests the potential for engineering the local electronic structures and dynamics of specific locations on TMDs and offers a potential for transferring unique electronic attributes of TMD to the molecular layers.

         <title>Indium Tin Oxide Induced Internal Positive Feedback and Indium Ion Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between perovskite decomposition products and indium tin oxide substrate triggers positive feedback cycle and deteriorates the stability of perovskite solar cell.







Abstract
Stability is the most pressing challenge hindering the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and previous efforts focused more on enhancing the resistance of PSCs to external stimulus. Here, we found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) will deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through positive feedback cycles. Specifically, the perovskite degradation products will cross the electron transport layer to chemically etch the electrode ITO to generate In3+, which will migrate upwards into the perovskite film. Then, the reaction that corrodes ITO consumes the decomposition products of perovskite and shifts the balance of the perovskite decomposition reaction, further promoting the degradation and thus falling into a positive feedback cycle. Moreover, the In3+ in the perovskite film was found to accumulate at the upper surface, which would lead to n&#8208;type doping of perovskite film to form the energy barrier for interface carrier extraction. Subsequently, the chelating molecule ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA&#8208;2Na) was introduced onto ITO to firmly chelate the In3+ and prevent it from migrating upward, thus breaking this internal positive feedback cycle and significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This work provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of photovoltaic performance loss and ionic transport in PSCs.

         <title>Design, Preparation, and Implementation of Axially Chiral Benzotetramisoles as Lewis Base Catalysts for Asymmetric Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTMs) that have both central and axial chirality were developed. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts were tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions, giving cycloaddition products with high stereoselectivities that are otherwise difficult to achieve with conventional BTM catalysts. Control experiments indicated that the axial and central chirality played a synergistic role in controlling the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Developing novel catalysts with potent activity is of great importance in organocatalysis. In this study, we designed and prepared a new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTM) that have both central and axial chirality. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts was tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions. These included the AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (2+2) cycloaddition between &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl anhydride with imines or oxindoles, and the sequential gold/AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (4+2) cycloaddition of enynamides with pentafluorophenyl esters. The interplay between axial and central chirality had a collaborative effect in regulating the stereochemistry in these cycloadditions, leading to high levels of stereoselectivity that would otherwise be challenging to achieve using conventional BTM catalysts. However, the (2+2) and (4+2) cycloadditions have different predilections for axial and central chirality combinations.

         <title>Reviving Cost&#8208;Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. The PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high working voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly by addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltages. Here, we design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li2ZrCl6, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, the interactions between the high&#8208;voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of the PQ cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations into the underlying chemistry give insights for the further development of practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>A General Strategy for Sustainable 3D Printing Based on A Multifunctional Photoinitiator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional photoinitiator that offers precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation (450&#8197;nm) and material degradation (365&#8197;nm) is developed. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured. Furthermore, this photoinitiator facilitates the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures. This represents a promising general strategy for the development of recyclable photoresins for 3D printing.







Abstract
A multifunctional photoinitiator is presented, offering precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation at 450&#8197;nm and material degradation at 365&#8197;nm. This is accomplished by covalently linking photoactive bis(acyl)phosphane oxide and photocleavable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ether moieties onto the surface of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured, exhibiting superior mechanical properties compared to the pristine material. Moreover, this photoinitiator enables the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures, representing a promising general strategy for developing recyclable photoresins for 3D printing applications.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure Enables Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte in High&#8208;Voltage Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure is realized in the co&#8208;solvent ether&#8208;based electrolyte at a medium concentration of 1.5&#8197;M. The introduction of weakly solvated DBE cosolvent greatly weakens the K+&#8208;solvent coordination, reducing the K+ desolvation energy. Furthermore, more anions occupy the inner solvation sheath, which enhances the oxidative stability and facilitates the formation of robust and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. These assure the ultrahigh compatibility with K metal anode and excellent electrochemical performance at high voltage.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;dominated solvation are promising candidates to achieve dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;voltage potassium metal batteries. However, it's challenging to form anion&#8208;reinforced solvates at low salt concentrations. Herein, we construct an anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure at a moderate concentration of 1.5&#8197;M with weakly coordinated cosolvent ethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The unique solvation structure accelerates the desolvation of K+, strengthens the oxidative stability to 4.94&#8197;V and facilitates the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. These enable stable plating/stripping of K metal anode over 2200&#8197;h, high capacity retention of 83.0&#8201;% after 150 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V in K0.67MnO2//K cells, and even 91.5&#8201;% after 30 cycles under 4.7&#8197;V. This work provides insight into weakly coordinated cosolvent and opens new avenues for designing ether&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage electrolytes.

         <title>Cyclic Azahelicene Dimers Showing Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Selective Fluoride Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized, and the diastereomeric pairs were successively separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers which showed bright circularly polarized luminescence and selective recognition of a fluoride anion.







Abstract
Although helicenes are promising molecules, the synthetic difficulty and tediousness have often been problems, and only small amounts of optically pure helicenes have been obtained by using chiral HPLC in most cases. Herein, aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized via the intramolecular Scholl reaction, and the diastereomeric pairs were separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers, and the chiroptical properties were investigated. The rigid &#960;&#8208;frameworks of the dimers led to the high molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields, while the twisted helicene moieties induced clear Cotton effects and CPL in the visible region, and the high CPL brightness (BCPL) was achieved. Furthermore, the cyclic dimers were found to have the macrocyclic cavity with the two NH groups suitable for the selective binding of a fluoride anion, which induced significantly redshifted fluorescence and CPL in the red region.

&lt;p&gt;Aza[7]helicenes or closed-aza[7]helicenes with (1&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized, and the diastereomeric pairs were successively separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers which showed bright circularly polarized luminescence and selective recognition of a fluoride anion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although helicenes are promising molecules, the synthetic difficulty and tediousness have often been problems, and only small amounts of optically pure helicenes have been obtained by using chiral HPLC in most cases. Herein, aza[7]helicenes or closed-aza[7]helicenes with (1&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized via the intramolecular Scholl reaction, and the diastereomeric pairs were separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers, and the chiroptical properties were investigated. The rigid &#960;-frameworks of the dimers led to the high molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields, while the twisted helicene moieties induced clear Cotton effects and CPL in the visible region, and the high CPL brightness (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt;) was achieved. Furthermore, the cyclic dimers were found to have the macrocyclic cavity with the two NH groups suitable for the selective binding of a fluoride anion, which induced significantly redshifted fluorescence and CPL in the red region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium Nanoclusters and Single Atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Achieves Low&#8208;Input/Input&#8208;Free Hydrogen Evolution via Decoupled/Coupled Hydrazine Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic activation of the bifunctional reaction kinetics of cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles decorated&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon by the concomitant Ru nanoclusters and single atom enables the efficient coupling or decoupling of hydrazine oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction for the multifold H2 production via the zinc hydrazine battery&#8208;driven overall hydrazine splitting system.







Abstract
The hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 evolution method promises low&#8208;input and input&#8208;free hydrogen production. However, developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) is challenging. Here, we introduce a bifunctional electrocatalyst &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA, merging ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (NCs) and single atoms (SA) into cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles&#8208;decorated N&#8208;doped carbon (&#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C) nanowires, through electrodeposition. The composite showcases exceptional activity for both HzOR and HER, requiring &#8722;80&#8197;mV and &#8722;9&#8197;mV respectively to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental insights confirm the importance of two Ru species for bifunctionality: NCs enhance the conductivity, and its coexistence with SA balances the H ad/desorption for HER and facilitates the initial dehydrogenation during the HzOR. In the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA excels as both anode and cathode materials, achieving 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at just 64&#8197;mV. The zinc hydrazine (Zn&#8722;Hz) battery assembled with &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA cathode and Zn foil anode can exhibit 97.3&#8201;% energy efficiency, as well as temporary separation of hydrogen gas during the discharge process. Therefore, integrating Zn&#8722;Hz with OHzS system enables self&#8208;powered H2 evolution, even in hydrazine sewage. Overall, the amalgamation of NCs with SA achieves diverse catalytic activities for yielding multifold hydrogen gas through advanced cell&#8208;integrated&#8208;electrolyzer system.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Applications of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the progress in covalent organic framework nanosheets, with a focus on studies that compare the performance of covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by demonstrating the impact of thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. The applications of CONs in components of batteries, as well as in biomedical applications, sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis are highlighted.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are two&#8208;dimensional, crystalline porous framework materials with numerous scopes for tunability, such as porosity, functionality, stability and aspect ratio (thickness to length ratio). The manipulation of &#960;&#8208;stacking in COFs results in truly 2D materials, namely covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), adds advantages in many applications. In this Minireview, we have discussed both top&#8208;down (COFs&#8594;CONs) and bottom&#8208;up (molecules&#8594;CONs) approaches with precise information on thickness and lateral growth. We have showcased the research progress on CONs in a few selected applications, such as batteries, catalysis, sensing and biomedical applications. This Minireview specifically highlights the reports where the authors compare the performance of CONs with COFs by demonstrating the impact of the thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. We have also provided the possible scope of exploration of CONs research in terms of inter&#8208;dimensional conversion, such as graphene to carbon nanotube and future technologies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbC nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanofibers are proposed as electrocatalysts to reduce nitrate/nitrite to ammonia, which attains an outstanding ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal carbides with metallic properties have been extensively used as electrocatalysts due to their excellent conductivity and unique electronic structures. Herein, NbC nanoparticles decorated carbon nanofibers (NbC@CNFs) are proposed as an efficient and robust catalyst for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite reduction, which achieves a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.4&#8201;% and a large ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat.. In situ electrochemical tests reveal the nitrite reduction at the catalyst surface follows the *NO pathway and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of NbC@CNFs heterostructure significantly broadens density of states nearby the Fermi energy. Finite element simulations unveil that the current and electric field converge on the NbC nanoparticles along the fiber, suggesting the dispersed carbides are highly active for nitrite reduction.

         <title>Stepwise Protonation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs were constructed and modified through a stepwise protonation of imine and porphyrin sites. Both benzo&#8208;selenadiazole functional groups and dual protonation increase the visible light absorption and charge separation, synergistically promoting the photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), recognized for their tailorable structures and accessible active sites, offer a promising platform for developing advanced photocatalysts. However, the difficulty in the synthesis and functionalization of 3D COFs hinders their further development. In this study, we present a series of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs with 8 connected porphyrin units linked by linear linkers through imine bonds as a versatile platform for photocatalyst design. The photoresponse of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs was initially modulated by functionalizing linear linkers with benzo&#8208;thiadiazole or benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups. Furthermore, taking advantage of the well&#8208;exposed porphyrin and imine sites in 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs, their photocatalytic activity was optimized by stepwise protonation of imine bonds and porphyrin centers. The dual protonated COF with benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups exhibited enhanced charge separation, leading to an increased photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light. This enhancement demonstrates the combined benefits of linker functionalization and stepwise protonation on photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Unveiling Dynamic Structure and Bond Evolutions in BiOIO3 Photocatalysts during CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic structure and bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on BiOIO3 photocatalysts.







Abstract
We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO3&#8208;based photocatalysts during CO2 reduction by combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy. More specifically, the selective photo&#8208;deposition of PtOx species on BiOIO3 (010) facets could effectively promote the electron enrichment on Bi active sites of (100) facets for facilitating the adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of Bi sites with high oxidation state and the shrink of crystalline structures. With introducing light irradiation to drive CO2 reduction, the Bi active sites with high oxidation states transformed into normal Bi3+ state, accompanying with the expansion of crystalline structures. Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical&#8208;state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtOx&#8208;BiOIO3 (195.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), much higher than the pristine (61.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) as well as metal&#8208;Pt decorated BiOIO3 (70.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Effect&#8208;Enabled Photocatalytic 4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Cyclization Cascade to Access Fluoroalkylated Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing fluoroalkylcyclobutanes is realized by photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. DFT calculations suggest that a fluorine effect, resulting from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the &#945;&#8208;selective radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates the uncommon 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are popular structural units in bioactive compounds and versatile intermediates in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging owing to high ring strain. In this study, a novel method for highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of fluoroalkylcyclobutanes bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters is realized by a photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a unique fluorine effect, arising from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the regio&#8208;reversed radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates an unprecedented 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure. This chemistry enables the direct and controllable construction of medicinally valuable quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing cyclobutanes from readily available raw materials, nicely complementing the existing methods.

         <title>Strong and Tough MXene Bridging&#8208;induced Conductive Nacre</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the need to reduce global carbon emissions, it remains a great challenge to prepare nacre&#8208;inspired composites using more economical and environmentally friendly building blocks. We fabricated tough and conductive nacre composites through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridging by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The resultant conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance.







Abstract
Nacre is a classic model, providing an inspiration for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites with the two&#8208;dimensional platelets. However, the &#8220;brick&#8221; of nacre, aragonite platelet, is an ideal building block for making high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrated a strong and tough conductive nacre through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridged by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the obtained conductive nacre reach ~282&#8197;MPa and ~6.3&#8197;MPa&#8201;m1/2, which is 1.6 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than that of natural nacre, respectively. These properties are attributed to densification and high orientation degree of the conductive nacre, which is effectively induced by the combined interactions of hydrogen bonding and MXene nanosheets bridging. The crack propagations in conductive nacre are effectively inhibited through crack deflection with hydrogen bonding, and MXene nanosheets bridging between aragonite platelets. In addition, our conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Our strategy of reassembling the aragonite platelets exfoliated from waste nacre into high&#8208;performance artificial nacre, provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites through the sustainable reutilization of shell resources.

         <title>Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;Migration at Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Constructed from &#945;&#8208;Keto Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;keto imines generated enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imines possessing synthetically challenging vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters. The electrophilicity of the imine and steric effects promoted a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl migration in the presence of Lewis acidic boronic acids, yielding chiral &#945;&#8208;amino ketones with excellent diastereoselectivity. This method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.







Abstract
A carbonyl&#8208;assisted asymmetric 1,2&#8208;migratory allylation through in situ generation of vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters is reported to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino ketones and amino alcohols with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. In a remarkable divergence, despite higher steric hindrance, the allylation exclusively occurs on ketones over imines in the first step, followed by a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl transfer, thus highlighting an exciting interplay between two distinct electrophiles. The methodology distinguishes itself through its adaptability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, showcasing broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and stereodivergence. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis led to a deeper understanding of its selectivity and mechanistic framework. Highlighting its transformative potential, the method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.

         <title>Acyl Phosphates as Chemically Fueled Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Sustaining Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium compartments regulated by an acyl phosphate chemical reaction network via chemical activation of carboxylic acids and alkyl phosphates. The compartments exist in the presence of chemical energy and decay without it. The chemical reaction network produces compartments even with prebiotically relevant activating agents, thus making it an attractive tool for studying Darwinian evolution in prebiotically plausible chemical systems incorporated with genotype&#8208;possessing structures.







Abstract
Lipids spontaneously assemble into vesicle&#8208;forming membranes. Such vesicles serve as compartments for even the simplest living systems. Vesicles have been extensively studied for constructing synthetic cells or as models for protocells&#8212;the cells hypothesized to have existed before life. These compartments exist almost always close to equilibrium. Life, however, exists out of equilibrium. In this work, we studied vesicle&#8208;based compartments regulated by a non&#8208;equilibrium chemical reaction network that converts activating agents. In this way, the compartments require a constant or periodic supply of activating agents to sustain themselves. Specifically, we use activating agents to condense carboxylates and phosphate esters into acyl phosphate&#8208;based lipids that form vesicles. These vesicles can only be sustained when condensing agents are present; without them, they decay. We demonstrate that the chemical reaction network can operate on prebiotic activating agents, opening the door to prebiotically plausible, self&#8208;sustainable protocells that compete for resources. In future work, such protocells should be endowed with a genotype, e.g., self&#8208;replicating RNA structures, to alter the protocell's behavior. Such protocells could enable Darwinian evolution in a prebiotically plausible chemical system.

         <title>Supramolecular Modifying Nafion with Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Functionalized Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Selective Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membranes with high selectivity are urgently required in energy and electronic technologies. Nafion, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial proton exchange membrane material, faces significant challenges. It suffers from the permeation of undesirable substances, like hydrogen in fuel cells and vanadium ions in redox flow batteries, due to the unmatched sizes between its ionic domains (3~5 nm) and these substances. In this work, we present a supramolecular modification strategy that simultaneously enhances the proton conductivity and selectivity of Nafion. We employ fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate (POMs) nanoclusters as supramolecular additives to modify Nafion via co&#8208;assembly. These POMs can precisely and robustly decorate at Nafion ionic domains, with their fluoroalkyl chains anchoring into the perfluorinated matrix while their inorganic clusters stay in the ionic regions. The hybrid membranes, with continuous proton hopping sites and nanoscale steric hindrance offered by POMs, exhibit a 56% increase in proton conductivity and a 100% improvement in proton/vanadium selectivity. This leads to significantly enhanced power density and energy efficiency in fuel cells and vanadium flow batteries, respectively. These results underscore the intriguing potential of molecular cluster additives in improving the functions of ion&#8208;conducting membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Cobalt&#8208;Photoredox Catalytic Approach for Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles with Aryl Amides via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we unveil a novel method for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles under cobalt/photoredox catalysis. By strategically activating C&#8208;H bonds of amides and subsequent migratory insertion of &#160;p&#8208;bonds present in indole as reactive partner, we achieve syn&#8208;selective tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;c]isoquinolin&#8208;5&#8208;one derivatives with excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99%. The developed method operates without a metal oxidant, relying solely on oxygen as the oxidant and employing an organic dye as a photocatalyst under irradiation. Control experiments and stoichiometric studies elucidate the reversible nature of the enantiodetermining C&#8208;H activation step, albeit not being rate&#8208;determining. This study not only expands the horizon of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8208;H bond functionalization, but also showcases the potential synergy between cobalt and photoredox catalysis in enabling asymmetric synthesis of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzyl&#8722;, Vinyl&#8722; and Borylsilanes via Asymmetric Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Palladium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of Si&#8208;bound methyl group provides an efficient access to diverse organosilanes. However, the asymmetric construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic architectures by functionalization of Si&#8208;bound methyl group has not yet been described despite recent significant progress in producing chiral silicon. Herein, we disclosed the enantioselective silylmethyl functionalization involving the aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;palladium migration to access diverse naphthalenes possessing an enantioenriched stereogenic silicon center, which are inaccessible before. It is worthy to note that the realization of asymmetric induction at the step of metal migration itself remains challenging. Our study constitutes the first enantioselective aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;palladium migration reaction. The key to the success is the discovery and fine&#8208;tuning of the different substituents of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol (TADDOL)&#8208;based phosphoramidites, which ensure the enantioselectivity and desired reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Diamond: A Diamondoid Superstructure Driven by &#960;&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the arrangement of superstructures through noncovalent interactions has a significant impact on macroscopic shape and the expression of unique properties. Constructing &#960;&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven hierarchical three&#8208;dimensional (3D) superstructures poses challenges on account of limited directional control and weak intermolecular interactions. Here we report the construction of a 3D diamondoid superstructure, named &#960;&#8208;Diamond, employing a ditopic strained Z&#8208;shaped building block comprising a porphyrin unit as bow&#8208;limb double&#8208;strapped with two m&#8208;xylylene units as bowstring. This superstructure, reminiscent of diamond's tetrahedral carbon composition, is composed of double&#8208;walled tetrahedron (DWT) driven solely by &#960;&#8208;interactions. Hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking between porphyrin and m&#8208;xylylene panels drive the assembly of four building blocks predominantly into a DWT, which undergoes extension to create an adamantane unit and eventually a diamondoid superstructure wherein each porphyrin panel is shared by two neighboring tetrahedra through hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking. &#960;&#8208;Diamond exhibits a solid&#8208;state fluorescent quantum yield 44 times higher than that of tetraphenylporphyrin along with excellent photocatalytic performance. The precise 3D directionality of &#960;&#8208;interactions, achieved through strained multipanel building blocks, revolutionizes the assembly of hierarchical 3D superstructures driven by &#960;&#8208;interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Trace Fluorinated Carbon dots driven Li&#8208;Garnet Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garnet solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) holds significant promise. However, the practical utilization has been seriously impeded by the poor contact of Li|garnet and electron leakage. Herein, one new type garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries is prososed with high&#8208;performance&#160; through the disparity in interfacial energy, induced by the reaction between trace fluorinated carbon dots (FCDs) and Li. The work of adhesion of Li|garnet is increased by the acquired Li&#8208;FCD composite, which facilitates an intimate Li|garnet interface with the promoted uniform Li+ deposition, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is futher validated that a concentrated C&#8208;Li2O&#8208;LiF component at the Li|garnet interface is spontaneously constructed, due to the the significant disparity in interfacial energy between C&#8208;Li2O&#8208;LiF|LLZTO and C&#8208;Li2O&#8208;LiF|Li. Furthermore, The electron transport and Li dendrites penetration are effectively hindered by the formed Li2O and LiF. The Li&#8208;FCD|LLZTO|Li&#8208;FCD symmetrical cells demonstrate stable cycling performance for over 3000 hours at 0.3 mA cm&#8722;2 and 800 hours at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the LFP|garnet|Li&#8208;FCD full cell exhibit remarkable cycling performance (91.6% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C). Our research has revealed a novel approach to establish a dendrite&#8208;free Li|garnet interface, laying the groundwork for future advancements in garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Depolymerization of Native Lignin over Thiol Capped Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Microbelts Mediated by Photogenerated Thiyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8 wt% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8 h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Oxides for Electrocatalytic Acidic NOx&#8722; Reduction Streamlining Ammonia Synthesis from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen oxide ions reduction reaction (NOx&#8722;RR) shows great opportunity for ammonia production under ambient conditions. Yet, performing NOx&#8722;RR in strong acidic conditions remains challenging due to the corrosion effect on the catalyst and competing hydrogen evolution reactions. Here, we demonstrate a stable La1.5Sr0.5Ni0.5Fe0.5O4 perovskite oxide for the NOx&#8722;RR at pH 0, achieving a Faradaic efficiency for ammonia of approaching 100% at a current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type cell. At industrially relevant current density, the NOx&#8722;RR system shows stable cell voltage and Faradaic efficiency for &gt;350 h in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at pH 0. By integrating the catalyst in a stacked MEA with a series connection, we have successfully obtained a record&#8208;breaking 2.578 g h&#8722;1 NH3 production rate at 20 A. This catalyst's unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources. Techno&#8208;economic and lifecycle assessments reveal substantial economic advantages for this ammonia production strategy, even when coupled with a plasma&#8208;based NOx production system, presenting a sustainable complement to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Intermediates of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SAzyme via Second&#8208;Shell Coordination for Selective Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation for single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), e.g., Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, is a key scientific issue that determines the activity, selectivity, and stability of aerobic reaction. However, the poor understanding of ROS formation mechanism on SAzymes greatly hampers their wider deployment. Herein, inspired by cytochromes P450 affording bound ROS intermediates in O2 activation, we report Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C containing the same FeN4 but with tunable second&#8208;shell coordination can effectively regulate ROS production pathways. Remarkably, compared to the control Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sample, the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C delivered a&#183;2.4&#8208;fold increase of oxidase&#8208;like activity via the bound Fe=O intermediate. Conversely, free ROS (&#8226;O2&#8208;) release was significantly reduced after functionalization, down to only 17% of that observed for Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. The detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalization significantly altered the electronic structure of FeN4 sites, leading to an increase of electron density at Fermi level. It enhanced the electron transfer from active sites to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the type of ROS in aerobic oxidation process. The proposed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;Cs with different second&#8208;shell anion were further applied to three aerobic oxidation reactions with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide production from water and oxygen is particularly interesting, yet remains a challenge. Herein, we have prepared four cyclic trinuclear units (CTUs) based MOFs, exhibiting good light absorption ability and suitable bandgaps for photosynthesis of H2O2. However, Cu&#8208;CTU&#8208;based MOFs are not able to photocatalyzed the formation of H2O2, while the alteration of metal nodes from Cu&#8208;CTU to Ag&#8208;CTU dramatically enhances the photocatalytic performance for H2O2production and the production rates can reach as high as 17476 &#956;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;with an apparent quantum yield of 9.51%, at 420 nm, which is much higher than most reported MOFs.&#160;The photocatalytic mechanism is comprehensively studied by combining the isotope labeling experiments and DFT calculation. This study provides new insights into the preparation of MOF photocatalysts with high activity for H2O2&#160;production through molecular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in&#8208;situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Terarylene Hybrid: Visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II Absorption via Sequential Photochromic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi&#8208;state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four&#8208;state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8211;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring&#8208;closing reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system in the terarylene unit, leading two terarylene radical molecules. The photogenerated terarylene radical further exhibits the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization reaction by UV irradiation. The delocalized &#960;&#8208;radical on the closed&#8208;ring form of the terarylene is efficient to enhance the photosensitivity to the NIR&#8208;I and &#8208;II region. Furthermore, a recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer as a structural isomer of the initial molecule. This is a consequence of the sequential hybrid photochromic system involving the HABI and terarylene units.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Activated Norbornenyl Esters &#8211; A Versatile Platform for Functional Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental sulfur has shown to be a promising alternative feedstock for development of novel polymeric materials with high sulfur content. However, the utilization of inverse vulcanized polymers is restricted by the limitation of functional comonomers suitable for an inverse vulcanization. Control over properties and structure of inverse vulcanized polymers still poses a challenge to current research due to the dynamic nature of sulfur&#8208;sulfur bonds and high temperature of inverse vulcanization reactions. In here, we report for the first time the inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester (NB&#8208;PFPE), allowing for post&#8208;modification of inverse vulcanized polymers via amidation of reactive PFP esters to yield high sulfur content polymers under mild conditions. Amidation of the precursor material with three functional primary amines (&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, allylamine) was investigated. The resulting materials were applicable as sulfur containing poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles in aqueous environment. Cross&#8208;linked mercury adsorbents, sulfur surface coatings, and high&#8208;sulfur content networks with predictable thermal properties were achievable using aminopropyl trimethoxy silane and allylamine for post&#8208;polymerization modification, respectively. With the broad range of different amines available and applicable for post&#8208;polymerization modification, the versatility of poly(sulfur&#8208;random&#8208;NB&#8208;PFPE) as a platform precursor polymer for novel specialized sulfur containing materials was showcased.</dc:description>

With the broad range of different amines available and applicable for post-polymerization modification, the versatility of poly(sulfur-random-NB-PFPE) as a platform precursor polymer for novel specialized sulfur containing materials was showcased.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Digital Light Processing to Afford High Resolution and Degradable CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vat photopolymerization 3D printing has proven very successful for the rapid additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric parts at high resolution. However, the range of materials that can be printed and their resulting properties remains narrow. Herein, we report the successful AM of a series of poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate) elastomers, derived from carbon dioxide and bio&#8208;derived &#949;&#8208;decalactone. Using a Co(II)Mg(II) polymerization catalyst, an ABA triblock copolymer (Mn = 6.3 kg mol&#8208;1, &#208;M = 1.26) was synthesized and 3D printed using digital light processing (DLP) with a thiol&#8208;ene. A series of elastomeric and degradable thermosets were produced, with varying cross&#8208;linker length and poly(ethylene glycol) content, to produce complex triply periodic geometries at high resolution. Thermomechanical characterization reveals printing&#8208;induced microphase separation and tunable hydrophilicity. These findings highlight how utilizing DLP can produce sustainable materials from low molar mass polyols quickly and at high resolution. The 3D printing of these functional materials will expedite the production of sustainable plastics and elastomers which have the potential to replace conventional petrochemical&#8208;based options.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiphoton&#8208;driven Photocatalytic Defluorination of Persistent Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Polymers by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and fluorinated polymers (FPs) have been extensively utilized in various industries, whereas their extremely high stability poses environmental persistence and waste treatment. Current decomposition approaches of PFASs and FPs typically require harsh conditions such as heating over 400&#176;C. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a new technique capable of decomposing them under mild conditions. Here, we demonstrated that perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), known as a "persistent chemical," and Nafion, a widely utilized sulfonated FP for ion&#8208;exchange membranes, can be efficiently decomposed into fluorine ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). PFOS was completely defluorinated within 8&#8208;h irradiation of 405&#8208;nm LED light, and the turnover number of the C&#8211;F bond dissociation per NC was 17200. Furthermore, 81% defluorination of Nafion was achieved for 24&#8208;h light irradiation, demonstrating the efficient photocatalytic properties under visible light. We revealed that this decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of efficiently breaking down various PFASs and FPs under mild conditions but also paves the way for advancing toward a sustainable fluorine&#8208;recycling society.</dc:description>

         <title>A fragment based competitive 19F LB&#8208;NMR platform for hotspot directed ligand profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive&#160;19F Ligand Based&#8208;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from&#160;Mycobacterium abscessus&#160;(Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of&#160;19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single&#160;19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive&#160;19F LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of&#160;19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This&#160;quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at&#160;hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive&#160;19F LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration as a General Strategy to Enhance Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical photoswitches have become a widely used approach for the remote control of biological functions with spatiotemporal precision. Several molecular scaffolds have been implemented to improve photoswitch characteristics, ranging from the nature of the photoswitch itself (e.g. azobenzenes, dithienylethenes, hemithioindigo) to fine&#8208;tuning of aromatic units and substituents. Herein, we present deuterated azobenzene photoswitches as a general means of enhancing the performance of photopharmacological molecules. Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity (higher molar extinction coefficient), photoswitch efficiency (higher photoisomerization quantum yield), and photoswitch kinetics (faster macroscopic rate of photoisomerization) with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene&#8208;based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Cracking of Non&#8208;Biodegradable Plastics to Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic pollution is worsening the living conditions on Earth, primarily due to the toxicity and stability of non&#8208;biodegradable plastics (NBPs). Photocatalytic cracking of NBPs is emerging as a promising way to cleave inert C&#8211;C bonds and abstract the carbon atoms from these wastes into valuable chemicals and fuels. However, controlling these processes is a huge challenge, ascribed to the complicated reactions of various NBPs. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the CO2 and carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic cracking of NBPs, with an emphasis on the pivotal intermediates. The CO2&#8208;mediated cracking proceeded with indiscriminate C&#8211;H/C&#8211;C bond cleavage of NBPs and tandem photoreduction of CO2, while carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated cracking was realized by the prior activation of C&#8211;H bonds for selective C&#8211;C bond cleavage of NBPs. Catalytic generation and conversion of different intermediates greatly depend on the kinds of active species and the structure of photocatalysts under light irradiation. Meanwhile, the fate of a specific intermediate is compared with small molecule activation to reveal the key problems in the cracking of NBPs. Finally, the challenges and potential directions are discussed to improve the overall efficiency in the photocatalytic cracking of NBPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Chirality Switching of a Dye&#8208;Grafted Helical Polymer Film Driven by Acid &amp; Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stimuli&#8208;responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, etc. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newlydesigned acid &amp; base&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, etc.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three&#8208;state switching) and good reversibility. The creative exploration of such a multiple chirality switching material can not only promote the application progress of current chiroptical regulation technologybut also provide a significant guidance for the design and synthesis of future smart chiroptical switching materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Antifouling Asymmetric Block Copolymer Nanofilms via Freestanding Interfacial Polymerization for Efficient and Sustainable Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane materials that resist nonspecific or specific adsorption are urgently required in widespread applications. In water purification, inevitable membrane fouling not only limits separation performance, but also remarkably increases operation requirements, and augments extra maintenance costs and higher energy consumption. In this work, we report a freestanding interfacial polymerization (IP) fabrication strategy for in&#8208;situ creation of asymmetric block copolymer (BCP) nanofilms with antifouling properties, greatly outperforming the conventional surface post&#8208;modification approaches. The resultant asymmetric BCP nanofilms with highly&#8208;dense, highly&#8208;hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) brushes, can be readily formed via a typical IP process of a double&#8208;hydrophilic BCP composed of an antifouling PEG block and a membrane&#8208;forming multiamine block. The asymmetric BCP nanofilms have been applied for efficient and sustainable natural water purification, demonstrating extraordinary antifouling capabilities accompanied with superior separation performance far beyond commercial polyamide nanofiltration membranes. The antifouling behaviors of BCP nanofilms derived from the combined effect of the hydration layer, electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were further elucidated by water flux and fouling resistance in combination with all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation. This work opens up a new avenue for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost creation of broad&#8208;spectrum, asymmetric membrane materials with diverse functional &#8220;defect&#8208;free&#8221; surfaces in real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core&#8208;shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space (THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni) via a one&#8208;step spray&#8208;drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieve volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at &#8208;20 &#176;C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g&#8208;1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core&#8208;shelled structure with tiny&#8208;void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast&#8208;charge and low&#8208;temperature storage features.</dc:description>

However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core-shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny-void space (THoCS-0.6Ni) via a one-step spray-drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone.

Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS-0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g-1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS-0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at -20 &#176;C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C.

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SB n Cl n  Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280 &#186;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B&#8208;spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The&#160;solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass&#8208;spectroscopy evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of closo&#8208;SBnCln with n = 4, 6, 10, and supra&#8208;icosahedral 12.</dc:description>

         <title>Clustering&#8208;resistant Cu Single Atoms on Porous Au Nanoparticles Supported by TiO2 for Sustainable Photoconversion of CO2 into CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysts based on single atoms (SAs) modification can lead to unprecedented reactivity with recent advances. However, the deactivation of SAs&#8208;modified photocatalysts remains a critical challenge in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this study, we unveil the detrimental effect of CO intermediates on Cu single atoms (Cu&#8208;SAs) during photocatalytic CO2 reduction, leading to clustering and deactivation on TiO2. To address this, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;SAs anchored on Au porous nanoparticles (CuAu&#8208;SAPNPs&#8208;TiO2) via a vectored etching approach. This system not only enhances CH4 production with a rate of 748.8 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 and 93.1% selectivity but also mitigates Cu&#8208;SAs clustering, maintaining stability over 7 days. This sustained high performance, despite the exceptionally high efficiency and selectivity in CH4 production, highlights the CuAu&#8208;SAPNPs&#8208;TiO2 overarching superior photocatalytic properties. Consequently, this work underscores the potential of tailored SAs&#8208;based systems for efficient and durable CO2 reduction by reshaping surface adsorption dynamics and optimizing the thermodynamic behavior of the SAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8208;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7:1 to &gt;98:2 d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Anion Conductive Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Hierarchical Ionic Highways for Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries are leading power sources for next&#8208;generation smart wearable electronics. However, flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries suffer from the highly&#8208;corrosive safety risk and limited lifespan due to the absence of reliable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Herein, a single&#8208;anion conductive SSE with high&#8208;safety is constructed by incorporating a highly amorphous dual&#8208;cation ionomer into a robust hybrid matrix of functional carbon nanotubes and polyacrylamide polymer. The as&#8208;fabricated SSE obtains dual&#8208;penetrating ionomer&#8208;polymer networks and hierarchical ionic highways, which contribute to mechanical robustness with 1200% stretchability, decent water uptake and retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 245 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1 and good Zn anode reversibility. Remarkably, the flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries delivers a high specific capacity of 764 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 and peak power density of 152 mW&#183;cm&#8208;2 as well as sustains excellent cycling stability for 1050 cycles (350 hours. This work offers a new paradigm of OH&#8208; conductors and broadens the definition and scope of OH&#8208; conductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Axial Ligand Enables Synthesis of Allenylsilane through Dirhodium(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is a dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed silylation of propargyl esters with hydrosilanes, using tertiary amines as axial ligands. By adopting this strategy, a range of versatile and useful allenylsilanes can be achieved with good yields. This reaction not only represents a SN2'&#8208;type silylation of the propargyl derivatives bearing a terminal alkyne moiety to synthesize allenylsilanes from simple hydrosilanes, but also represents a new application of dirhodium(II) complexes in catalytic transformation of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond. The highly functionalized allenylsilanes that are produced can be transformed into a series of synthetically useful organic molecules. In this reaction, an intriguing ON&#8208;OFF effect of the amine ligand was observed. The reaction almost did not occur (OFF) without addition of Lewis base amine ligand. However, the reaction took place smoothly (ON) after addition of only catalytic amount of amine ligand. Detailed mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reactivity can be delicately improved by the use of tertiary amine. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the formation of the Rh&#8208;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation&#160;(CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Selenol&#8208;Yne Click (SYC) Reaction Enables&#160;Poly(selenoacetal) Covalent Adaptable Network&#160;Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) based on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) presents a promising avenue for achieving resource recovery and utilization. In this study, we discovered a novel dynamic covalent bond called selenacetal, which is obtained through a double click reaction between selenol and activated alkynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the &#916;G for the formation of selenoacetals ranges from 12 to 18 kJ mol&#8208;1, suggesting its potential for dynamic reversibility. Dynamic exchange experiments involving small molecules and polymers provide substantial evidence supporting the dynamic exchange properties of selenoacetals. By utilizing this highly efficient click reaction, we successfully synthesized dynamic materials based on selenoacetal with remarkable reprocessing capabilities without any catalysts. These materials exhibit chemical recycling under alkaline conditions, wherein selenoacetal (SA) can decompose into active enone selenide (ES) and diselenides. Reintroducing selenol initiates a renewed reaction with the enone selenide, facilitating material recycling and yielding a newly developed dynamic material exhibiting both photo&#8208; and thermal responsiveness. The results underscore the potential of selenoacetal polymers in terms of recyclability and selective degradation, making them a valuable addition to conventional covalent adaptable networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable carbamazepine analogs for non&#8208;invasive neuroinhibition in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A problem of systemic pharmacotherapy is off&#8208;target activity, which causes adverse effects. Outstanding examples include neuroinhibitory medications like antiseizure drugs, which are used against epilepsy and neuropathic pain but cause systemic side effects. There is a need of drugs that inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand without affecting other regions of the body. Photopharmacology aims to address this problem with light&#8208;activated drugs and localized illumination in the target organ. Here, we have developed photoswitchable derivatives of the widely prescribed antiseizure drug carbamazepine. For that purpose, we expanded our method of ortho azologization of tricyclic drugs to meta/para and to N&#8208;bridged diazocine. Our results validate the concept of ortho cryptoazologs (uniquely exemplified by Carbazopine&#8208;1) and bring to light Carbadiazocine (8), which can be photoswitched between 400&#8208;590 nm light (using violet LEDs and halogen lamps) and shows good drug&#8208;likeness and predicted safety. Both compounds display photoswitchable activity in vitro and in translucent zebrafish larvae. Carbadiazocine (8) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy (mechanical and thermal stimuli) in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non&#8208;invasive illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Doped Bismuth Nanosheet Catalyst for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Electrolyte&#8208;Free Formic acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO&#8722;) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO&#173;2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal&#8208;doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high&#8208;purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal&#8208;doped Bi catalysts, Co&#8208;doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90% HCOO&#8722; selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8208;2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co&#8208;doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72% after a 100&#8208;hour operation under a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, generating 0.1 M HCOOH at 3.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co&#8208;doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen&#8208;Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing moieties, namely ZnPc&#8208;2NO and ZnPc&#8208;4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor protein HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc&#8208;2NO elicits the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen&#8208;economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for Efficient and Selective SO2 Capture from CO2&#8208;rich Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capture of a low concentration SO2 is of utmost importance as it is responsible for many health and environmental issues. Herein we unveiled two porous organic polymers encompassing a high content of imidazole pockets to interact preferentially with SO2 vs CO2 which can remove trace amount of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams with almost infinite selectivity and high capacity.







Abstract
The quest for effective technologies to reduce SO2 pollution is crucial due to its adverse effects on the environment and human health. Markedly, removing a ppm level of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing waste gas is a persistent challenge, and current technologies suffer from low SO2/CO2 selectivity and energy&#8208;intensive regeneration processes. Here using the molecular building blocks approach and theoretical calculation, we constructed two porous organic polymers (POPs) encompassing pocket&#8208;like structures with exposed imidazole groups, promoting preferential interactions with SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams. Markedly, the evaluated POPs offer outstanding SO2/CO2 selectivity, high SO2 capacity, and an easy regeneration process, making it one of the best materials for SO2 capture. To gain better structural insights into the notable SO2 selectivity of the POPs, we used dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy (DNP) and molecular modelling to probe the interactions between SO2 and POP adsorbents. The newly developed materials are poised to offer an energy&#8208;efficient and environment&#8208;friendly SO2 separation process while we are obliged to use fossil fuels for our energy needs.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Inducible and Photoactivatable Cellular RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines the CRISPR/dCas13b and chemical induced proximity (CIP) techniques to develop a small molecule&#8208;induced photo&#8208;controllable m1A demethylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A) as well as an m1A methylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;m1A). These m1A editing tools are able to regulate the biological function of targeted RNAs by modulating m1A modifications, which in turn influences cell functions.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at A8422 of MALAT1 RNA, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylation function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.

         <title>Large Libraries of Structurally Diverse Macrocycles Suitable for Membrane Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles are promising for drug development due to their good binding properties and the potential to cross membranes. A synthetic strategy and chemical building blocks are developed to produce and screen thousands of small, structurally highly diverse peptidic macrocycles. HTS identifies potent thrombin inhibitors with good membrane permeability. The strategy may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.







Abstract
Macrocycles offer an attractive format for drug development due to their good binding properties and potential to cross cell membranes. To efficiently identify macrocyclic ligands for new targets, methods for the synthesis and screening of large combinatorial libraries of small cyclic peptides were developed, many of them using thiol groups for efficient peptide macrocyclization. However, a weakness of these libraries is that invariant thiol&#8208;containing building blocks such as cysteine are used, resulting in a region that does not contribute to library diversity but increases molecule size. Herein, we synthesized a series of structurally diverse thiol&#8208;containing elements and used them for the combinatorial synthesis of a 2,688&#8208;member library of small, structurally diverse peptidic macrocycles with unprecedented skeletal complexity. We then used this library to discover potent thrombin and plasma kallikrein inhibitors, some also demonstrating favorable membrane permeability. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of macrocycle&#8208;target complexes showed that the size and shape of the newly developed thiol elements are key for binding. The strategy and library format presented in this work significantly enhance structural diversity by allowing combinatorial modifications to a previously invariant region of peptide macrocycles, which may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.

Constructing Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 supported intermetallic L10&#8722;PtNi NPs via regulating RMSI between Pt and supports as high&#8208;performing ORR catalysts for PEMFCs







Abstract
Developing efficient and anti&#8208;corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance for the applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we report a novel approach to prepare metal oxides supported intermetallic Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) via the reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) as ORR catalysts, using Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 (Ni/ZrO2) supported L10&#8722;PtNi NPs as a proof of concept. Benefiting from the Ni migration during RMSI, the oxygen vacancy concentrations in the support are increased, leading to an electron enrichment of Pt. The optimal L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI catalyst achieves remarkably low mass activity (MA) loss (17.8&#8201;%) after 400,000 accelerated durability test cycles in a half&#8208;cell and exceptional PEMFC performance (MA=0.76&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=1.52/0.92&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2/&#8722;air, and 18.4&#8201;% MA decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles), representing the best reported Pt&#8208;based ORR catalysts without carbon supports. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI requires a lower energetic barrier for ORR than L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2 (direct loading), which is ascribed to a decreased Bader charge transfer between Pt and *OH, and the improved stability of L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI compared to L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;C can be contributed to the increased adhesion energy and Ni vacancy formation energy within the PtNi alloy.

&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient and anti-corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance for the applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Dynamic Structural Color in a Host&#8208;Guest System for Time&#8208;Dependent Anticounterfeiting and Double&#8208;Lock Encryption</title>

We report a dynamic structural color induced by the difference in the time required for accomplishing the assembly process. This distinctive result opens a door for countless applications in time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and double&#8208;lock encryption.







Abstract
Manipulation of periodic micro/nanostructures in polymer film is of great importance for academics and industrial applications in anticounterfeiting. However, with the increasing demand on information security, materials with time&#8208;dependent features are urgently required, especially the material where the same information can appear more than once on the time scale. Here, one concise strategy to realize time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption based on a host&#8208;guest system is proposed, with one photoresponsive azopolymer as the host and one liquid&#8208;crystalline molecule as the guest. The system exhibits a tunable mass transport in pre&#8208;designed periodic micro/nanostructures by tailoring the process of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans recovery of azo groups and assembly of mesogenic trans&#8208;isomers, resulting in a dynamic structural color in film. Taking advantage of this extraordinary feature, time&#8208;dependent dynamic anticounterfeiting has been achieved. More importantly, the time of each state's appearance in the whole process can be modulated by changing the host&#8208;guest ratio. Combining the manipulatable process of mass transport with the unique decoding method, the stored information in film can be decrypted correctly. This work provides an unprecedented dynamic approach for advanced anticounterfeiting technology with a higher level of security and high&#8208;end applications in information encryption.

         <title>Detection of Sulfoquinovosidase Activity in Cell Lysates Using Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of activity&#8208;based probes targeting the active site nucleophile of glycoside hydrolase family&#8197;31 sulfoquinovosidases is described. The probes are shown to bind covalently by structural biology, mass spectrometry and Cy5 in&#8208;gel fluorescence, are selective for sulfoquinovosidases in whole bacterial cell lysates, and are used to monitor active levels of enzyme over time.







Abstract
The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, constitutes a major sulfur reserve in the biosphere. Microbial breakdown of SQDG is critical for the biological utilization of its sulfur. This commences through release of the parent sugar, sulfoquinovose (SQ), catalyzed by sulfoquinovosidases (SQases). These vanguard enzymes are encoded in gene clusters that code for diverse SQ catabolic pathways. To identify, visualize and isolate glycoside hydrolase CAZY&#8208;family&#8197;31 (GH31) SQases in complex biological environments, we introduce SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). These ABPs label the active site nucleophile of this enzyme family, consistent with specific recognition of the SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine in the active site, as evidenced in the 3D structure of Bacillus megaterium SQase. A fluorescent Cy5&#8208;probe enables visualization of SQases in crude cell lysates from bacteria harbouring different SQ breakdown pathways, whilst a biotin&#8208;probe enables SQase capture and identification by proteomics. The Cy5&#8208;probe facilitates monitoring of active SQase levels during different stages of bacterial growth which show great contrast to more traditional mRNA analysis obtained by RT&#8208;qPCR. Given the importance of SQases in global sulfur cycling and in human microbiota, these SQase ABPs provide a new tool with which to study SQase occurrence, activity and stability.

A 1064&#8197;nm&#8208;laser&#8208;excitable molecule with balanced radiative and non&#8208;radiative decay is fabricated by molecular engineering. Further work validated excellent trimodal NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FLI)/NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PAI)/photothermal (PTI) imaging and good NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy (PTT) tumor ablation in orthotopic breast cancer mice models with negligible biotoxicity in vivo.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;activated organic photothermal agent that synchronously enables satisfying NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging is highly warranted yet rather challenging on the basis of the overwhelming nonradiative decay. Herein, such an agent, namely TPABT&#8208;TD, was tactfully designed and constructed via employing benzo[c]thiophene moiety as bulky electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge and tailoring the peripheral molecular rotors. Benefitting from its high electron donor&#8211;acceptor strength and finely modulated intramolecular motion, TPABT&#8208;TD simultaneously exhibits ultralong absorption in NIR&#8208;II region, intense fluorescence emission in the NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) region as nanoaggregates, and high photothermal conversion upon 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Those intrinsic advantages endow TPABT&#8208;TD nanoparticles with prominent fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy against orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor with negligible adverse effect.

Electrochemical synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;rich amines by aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compoundsElectrochemical aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compounds was achieved under mild conditions without stringent exclusion of moisture and air. Complementary to existing photochemical methodologies, this catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive approach involves the coupling of cathodically generated nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radicals with suitable radical acceptors, enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted amines with valuable molecular scaffolds.

Alkylamines form the backbone of countless nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules possessing desirable biological properties. Despite advances in amine synthesis through transition metal catalysis and photoredox chemistry, multicomponent reactions that leverage inexpensive materials to transform abundant chemical feedstocks into three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;substituted alkylamines bearing complex substitution patterns remain scarce. Here, we report the design of a catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive manifold that merges amines, carbonyl compounds and carbon&#8208;based radical acceptors under ambient conditions without rigorous exclusion of air and moisture. Key to this aminative carbofunctionalization process is the chemoselective generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radical intermediates that readily couple with electrophilic partners, providing straightforward access to architecturally intricate alkylamines and drug&#8208;like scaffolds which are inaccessible by conventional means.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical synthesis of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-rich amines by aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compoundsElectrochemical aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compounds was achieved under mild conditions without stringent exclusion of moisture and air. Complementary to existing photochemical methodologies, this catalyst-free electroreductive approach involves the coupling of cathodically generated nucleophilic &#945;-amino radicals with suitable radical acceptors, enabling the synthesis of &#945;-substituted amines with valuable molecular scaffolds.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of Formamides from Amines and Bioderived Formyl Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerobic oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable formyl surrogate derived from biobased feedstocks such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde is achieved over C3N4&#8208;supported single CuN4 sites with 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms and much higher turnover frequency (TOF) than noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
Herein we present a new strategy for the oxidative synthesis of formamides from various types of amines and bioderived formyl sources (DHA, GLA and GLCA) and molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant on g&#8208;C3N4 supported Cu catalysts. Combined characterization data from EPR, XAFS, XRD and XPS revealed the formation of single CuN4 sites on supported Cuphen/C3N4 catalysts. EPR spin trapping experiments disclosed &#8901;OOH radicals as reactive oxygen species and &#8901;NR1R2 radicals being responsible for the initial C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Control experiments and DFT calculations showed that the successive C&#8722;C bond cleavage in DHA proceeds via a reaction mechanism co&#8208;mediated by &#8901;NR1R2 and &#8901;OOH radicals based on the well&#8208;equilibrated CuII and CuI cycle. Our catalyst has much higher activity (TOF) than those based on noble metals.

         <title>Delocalizing Excitation for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

The electron&#8208;phonon coupling in organic photovoltaic materials (2FBP&#8208;4F) was reduced through a rational fluoro&#8208;substituted strategy, promoting exciton delocalization. Polaron pairs and polarons were observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles, facilitating the generation of free charge. 2FBP&#8208;4F exhibited high photocatalytic performance in both single&#8208;component and heterojunction systems.







Abstract
Localized excitation in traditional organic photocatalysts typically prevents the generation and extraction of photo&#8208;induced free charge carriers, limiting their activity enhancement under illumination. Here, we enhance delocalized photoexcitation of small molecular photovoltaic catalysts by weakening their electron&#8208;phonon coupling via rational fluoro&#8208;substitution. The optimized 2FBP&#8208;4F catalyst we develop here exhibits a minimized Huang&#8211;Rhys factor of 0.35 in solution, high dielectric constant and strong crystallization in the solid state. As a result, the energy barrier for exciton dissociation is decreased, and more importantly, polarons are unusually observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles (NPs). With the increased hole transfer efficiency and prolonged charge carrier lifetime highly related to enhanced exciton delocalization, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP&#8208;4F heterojunction NPs at varied concentration exhibit much higher optimized photocatalytic activity (207.6&#8211;561.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) for hydrogen evolution than the control PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BP&#8208;4F and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP&#8208;6F NPs, as well as other reported photocatalysts under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Polyfluorinated Organic Diammonium Induced Lead Iodide Arrangement for Efficient Two&#8208;Step&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are developed by incorporating a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt which cann't generate low&#8208;dimensional perovskites into the lead iodide precursor to change the arrangement of the lead iodide crystals. The resulting high&#8208;quality perovskite film with large grain size boost the efficiencies to 24.70&#8201;% and 21.04&#8201;% for cell (0.06&#8197;cm2) and module (100&#8197;cm2), respectively.







Abstract
The inefficient conversion of lead iodide to perovskite has become one of the major challenges in further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the two&#8208;step method. Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP&#8208;PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP&#8208;PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76&#8201;% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04&#8201;% was achieved in a large&#8208;area perovskite module (100&#8197;cm2). Our work provides a unique insight into the function of organic diammonium additive in boosting photovoltaic performance.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Caged Rhodamine Generating Nitrosoperoxycarbonate for Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and visible light&#8208;triggered ONOOCO2&#8722; donor (NPCD565) was devised. Its photolysis generated a rhodamine dye along with two mild radicals, e.g., NO and CO2.&#8722;. Their further combination with O2 yields ONOOCO2&#8722;, homolysis of which yields two potent radicals NO2 and CO3.&#8722;, which were harnessed to induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells. In mouse models, ablation of the primary tumor and suppression of the distant tumor were achieved.







Abstract
Photoimmunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment modality. While potent 1&#8208;e&#8722; oxidative species are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), they are also associated with unspecific oxidation and collateral tissue damage. This difficulty may be addressed by post&#8208;generation radical reinforcement. Namely, non&#8208;oxidative radicals are first generated and subsequently activated into powerful oxidative radicals to induce ICD. Here, we developed a photo&#8208;triggered molecular donor (NPCD565) of nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2&#8722;), the first of its class to our knowledge, and further evaluated its feasibility for immunotherapy. Upon irradiation of NPCD565 by light within a broad spectral region from ultraviolet to red, ONOOCO2&#8722; is released along with a bright rhodamine dye (RD565), whose fluorescence is a reliable and convenient build&#8208;in reporter for the localization, kinetics, and dose of ONOOCO2&#8722; generation. Upon photolysis of NPCD565 in 4T1 cells, damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of ICD were observed and confirmed to exhibit immunogenicity by induced maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo studies with a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model showcased the potent tumor&#8208;killing capability of NPCD565 of the primary tumors and growth suppression of the distant tumors. This work unveils the potent immunogenicity of ONOOCO2&#8722;, and its donor (NPCD565) has broad potential for photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, homolysis of which yields two potent radicals NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which were harnessed to induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells. In mouse models, ablation of the primary tumor and suppression of the distant tumor were achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoimmunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment modality. While potent 1-e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxidative species are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), they are also associated with unspecific oxidation and collateral tissue damage. This difficulty may be addressed by post-generation radical reinforcement. Namely, non-oxidative radicals are first generated and subsequently activated into powerful oxidative radicals to induce ICD. Here, we developed a photo-triggered molecular donor (&lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt;) of nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), the first of its class to our knowledge, and further evaluated its feasibility for immunotherapy. Upon irradiation of &lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt; by light within a broad spectral region from ultraviolet to red, ONOOCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is released along with a bright rhodamine dye (&lt;b&gt;RD565&lt;/b&gt;), whose fluorescence is a reliable and convenient build-in reporter for the localization, kinetics, and dose of ONOOCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generation. Upon photolysis of &lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt; in 4T1 cells, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of ICD were observed and confirmed to exhibit immunogenicity by induced maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo studies with a bilateral tumor-bearing mouse model showcased the potent tumor-killing capability of &lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt; of the primary tumors and growth suppression of the distant tumors. This work unveils the potent immunogenicity of ONOOCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and its donor (&lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt;) has broad potential for photo-immunotherapy of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Crystal and Pentatwinned Gold Nanorods Result in Chiral Nanocrystals with Reverse Handedness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The handedness of chiral gold nanorods synthesized by seeded growth typically follows that of the organic chiral inducer, being right&#8208;handed when templated by S&#8208;BINAMINE micelles or induced by L&#8208;cystine (L&#8208;2cys). Our results demonstrate that a change in the achiral seed, from single crystalline to pentatwinned, can reverse the sign of circular dichroism (CD) measurements, adding a new effect to guide the chirality of gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Handedness is an essential attribute of chiral nanocrystals, having a major influence on their properties. During chemical growth, the handedness of nanocrystals is usually tuned by selecting the corresponding enantiomer of chiral molecules involved in asymmetric growth, often known as chiral inducers. We report that, even using the same chiral inducer enantiomer, the handedness of chiral gold nanocrystals can be reversed by using Au nanorod seeds with either single crystalline or pentatwinned structure. This effect holds for chiral growth induced both by amino acids and by chiral micelles. Although it was challenging to discern the morphological handedness for L&#8208;cystine&#8208;directed particles, even using electron tomography, both cases showed circular dichroism bands of opposite sign, with nearly mirrored chiroptical signatures for chiral micelle&#8208;directed growth, along with quasi&#8208;helical wrinkles of inverted handedness. These results expand the chiral growth toolbox with an effect that might be exploited to yield a host of interesting morphologies with tunable optical properties.

         <title>An Expedient Radical Approach for the Decarboxylative Synthesis of Stereodefined All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;based, photo&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative formation of stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins is reported using various &#945;&#8208;amino radical precursors and heterocycles as substrates. This user&#8208;friendly protocol combines a wide structural scope, easy drug and postsynthetic manipulations, and variation in both reaction partners. The mechanistic studies reveal a key CO2 extrusion step to enable the overall transformation.







Abstract
We report a user&#8208;friendly approach for the decarboxylative formation of stereodefined and complex tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted olefins from vinyl cyclic carbonates and amines as radical precursors. The protocol relies on easy photo&#8208;initiated &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;radical formation followed by addition onto the double bond of the substrate resulting in a sequence involving carbonate ring&#8208;opening, double bond relay, CO2 extrusion and finally O&#8208;protonation. The developed protocol is efficient for both mismatched and matched polarity substrate combinations, and the scope of elaborate stereodefined olefins that can be forged including drug&#8208;functionalized derivatives is wide, diverse and further extendable to other types of heterocyclic and radical precursors. Mechanistic control reactions show that the decarboxylation step is a key driving force towards product formation, with the initial radical addition under steric control.

         <title>Efficient Ultraviolet Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Cerium Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

An effective strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance UV&#8208;CPL is proposed by constructing Ce3+&#8208;based 0D chiral HMHs. R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 show large |glum| values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2 and FM values of (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which is superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL active materials. The UV CP light from the fabricated CP&#8208;LEDs can trigger enantioselective photopolymerizations of diacetylene and yield polymerized products with anisotropy factors of CD up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2.







Abstract
Ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (UV&#8208;CPL) with high photon energy shows great potential in polarized light sources and stereoselective photopolymerization. However, developing luminescent materials with high UV&#8208;CPL performance remains challenging. Here, we report a pair of rare earth Ce3+&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7, which exhibits characteristic UV emissions derived from the Ce 5d&#8211;4f transition. The compounds show simultaneously high photoluminescent quantum yields of (32&#8211;39)% and large luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum|) values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2. Thus, the figures of merits of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 are calculated to be (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which are superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL emissive materials. Additionally, nearly 91&#8201;% of their PL intensities at 300&#8197;K can be well preserved at 380&#8197;K (LED operating temperature) without phase transition or decomposition, demonstrating the excellent structural and optical thermal stabilities of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7. Based on these enantiomers, the fabricated UV&#8208;emitting CP&#8208;LEDs exhibit high polarization degrees of &#177;1.0&#8201;%. Notably, the UV&#8208;CPL generated from the devices can significantly trigger the enantioselective photopolymerization of diacetylene with remarkable stereoselectivity, and consequently yield polymerized products with the anisotropy factors of circular dichroism (gCD) up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2, outperforming other UV&#8208;CPL materials and demonstrating their great potential as UV&#8208;polarized light sources.

         <title>Isothermal Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals Driven by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal phase transitions via dynamic covalent chemistry have been unlocked in nematic arrays. A nematic aldehyde was on&#8208;surface treated with various amines, triggering diverse phase transitions driven by imination reactions. The unlocking of these new adaptable liquid crystal systems paves the way for the conception of programmable structural pathways and new materials capable of evolving by chemical stimuli and temperature modulation.







Abstract
The dynamic nature of calamitic liquid crystals is exploited to perform isothermal phase transitions driven by dynamic covalent chemistry. For this purpose, nematic (N) arrays based on aldehyde 1 were treated with different amines (A&#8211;E) in an on&#8208;surface process, which resulted in different isothermal phase transitions.

     alt="Isothermal Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals Driven by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isothermal phase transitions via dynamic covalent chemistry have been unlocked in nematic arrays. A nematic aldehyde was on-surface treated with various amines, triggering diverse phase transitions driven by imination reactions. The unlocking of these new adaptable liquid crystal systems paves the way for the conception of programmable structural pathways and new materials capable of evolving by chemical stimuli and temperature modulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of calamitic liquid crystals is exploited to perform isothermal phase transitions driven by dynamic covalent chemistry. For this purpose, nematic (N) arrays based on aldehyde &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; were treated with different amines (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;) in an on-surface process, which resulted in different isothermal phase transitions. These phase transformations were caused by in situ imination reactions and are dependent on the nature of the added amine. Transitions from the N to crystal (&lt;b&gt;1A&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1E&lt;/b&gt;), isotropic (&lt;b&gt;1B&lt;/b&gt;), and smectic (Sm) (&lt;b&gt;1C&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1D&lt;/b&gt;) phases were achieved, while the resulting materials feature thermotropic liquid crystal behavior. A sequential transformation from the N &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to the Sm &lt;b&gt;1C&lt;/b&gt; and then to the N &lt;b&gt;1B&lt;/b&gt; was achieved by coupling an imination to a transimination processes and adjusting the temperature. All of these processes were well characterized by microscopic, spectroscopic, and X-ray techniques, unlocking not only the constitutional but also the structural aspects of the phase transitions. This work provides new insights into designing constitutionally and structurally adaptable liquid crystal systems, paving the way toward the conception of programable evolutive pathways and adaptive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of (&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes Reveals an Unusual Indole Ring Cleavage Pathway Catalyzed by P450 Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

Novel enantiomeric natural indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton were isolated from a mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus. The cytochrome P450 enzyme was identified to catalyze the C2&#8722;C3 double bond cleavage of indole ring to generate products with two keto groups during the biosynthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactam indole terpenoids. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase.







Abstract
(&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes A&#8722;D (1&#8211;4), the first representatives of indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton, were isolated from the mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus Penicillium brocae MA&#8208;231. Our bioactivity tests revealed their potent antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The biosynthetic reactions by the five enzymes PbaABCDE leading to &#947;&#8208;lactam ring formation were identified with heterologous expression and in vitro enzymatic assays. Remarkably, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PbaB and its homolog in Aspergillus oryzae catalyzed the 2,3&#8208;cleavage of the indole ring to generate two keto groups in 1. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase. In addition, rare secondary amide bond formation by the glutamine synthetase&#8208;like enzyme PbaD was reported. These findings will contribute to the engineered biosynthesis of unnatural, bioactive indole terpenoids.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Crystal Structures of Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals through Trace Cadmium(II) Doping for Efficient Color&#8208;Saturated Green LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

A trace Cd2+ doping into FAPbBr3 nanocrystals leads to the increase of exciton effective mass due to the slight perovskite octahedra distortion. Benefiting from enhanced exciton binding energy and almost unchanged Auger recombination rate, a highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% and 534&#8197;nm emission wavelength has been obtained.







Abstract
Decreasing perovskite nanocrystal size increases radiative recombination due to the quantum confinement effect, but also increases the Auger recombination rate which leads to carrier imbalance in the emitting layers of electroluminescent devices. Here, we overcome this trade&#8208;off by increasing the exciton effective mass without affecting the size, which is realized through the trace Cd2+ doping of formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals. We observe an ~2.7&#8197;times increase in the exciton binding energy benefiting from a slight distortion of the [BX6]4&#8722; octahedra caused by doping in the case of that the Auger recombination rate is almost unchanged. As a result, bright color&#8208;saturated green emitting perovskite nanocrystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are obtained. Cd2+ doping also shifts up the energy levels of the nanocrystals, relative to the Fermi level so that heavily n&#8208;doped emitters convert into only slightly n&#8208;doped ones; this boosts the charge injection efficiency of the corresponding light&#8208;emitting diodes. The light&#8208;emitting devices based on those nanocrystals reached a high external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% corresponding to a current efficiency of 123&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and showed dramatically improved device lifetime, with a narrow bandwidth of 22&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage coordinates of (0.20, 0.76) for color&#8208;saturated green emission for the electroluminescence peak centered at 534&#8197;nm, thus being fully compliant with the latest standard for wide color gamut displays.

         <title>Rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery for hydrogen storage and production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop process for H2 storage and production using Zn as an electron carrier to combine a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery to generate H2 and an alkaline electrolyzer to regenerate Zn. The Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using cheap renewable energy and produce H2 on demand more than 600&#8197;times.







Abstract
Reactive metals hydrolysis offers significant advantages for hydrogen storage and production. However, the regeneration of common reactive metals (e.g., Mg, Al, etc.) is energy&#8208;intensive and produces unwanted byproducts such as CO2 and Cl2. Herein, we employ Zn as a reactive mediator that can be easily regenerated by electrolysis of ZnO in an alkaline solution with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. H2 is produced in the same electrolyte by constructing a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery consisting of a Zn anode and a Raney&#8208;Ni cathode to unlock the Zn&#8208;H2O reaction. The entire two&#8208;step water splitting reaction with a net energy efficiency of 70.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using renewable energy to produce H2 on demand and runs for 600 cycles only sacrificing 3.76&#8201;% energy efficiency. DFT calculations reveal that the desorption of H* on Raney&#8208;Ni (&#8722;0.30&#8197;eV) is closer to zero compared with that on Zn (&#8722;0.87&#8197;eV), indicating a faster desorption of H* at low overpotential. Further, a 24&#8197;Ah electrolyzer is demonstrated to produce H2 with a net energy efficiency of 65.5&#8201;%, which holds promise for its real application.

         <title>Unprecedented POSS&#8208;Linked 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with 2&#8208;Fold Interpenetrated scu or sqc Topology Regulated by Porphyrin Center for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topology of unprecedented POSS&#8208;linked 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been revealed to show dependence on the central ions of porphyrin building block. Central metal ions of Co(II) and Zn(II) in porphyrin building block result in the formation of POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with scu topology, while metal free and Ni central ions lead to POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with symmetric sqc topology. The well&#8208;distributed porphyrin units in these COFs endow them with enhanced performance in both photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and photocatalytic production of artemisinin.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of porphyrin center regulated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated scu or sqc topology have been investigated. These COFs exhibit unique structural features and properties, making them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications in CO2 reduction and artemisinin synthesis.

     alt="Unprecedented POSS-Linked 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with 2-Fold Interpenetrated scu or sqc Topology Regulated by Porphyrin Center for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topology of unprecedented POSS-linked 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been revealed to show dependence on the central ions of porphyrin building block. Central metal ions of Co(II) and Zn(II) in porphyrin building block result in the formation of POSS-MTFPP-COFs with &lt;b&gt;scu&lt;/b&gt; topology, while metal free and Ni central ions lead to POSS-MTFPP-COFs with symmetric &lt;b&gt;sqc&lt;/b&gt; topology. The well-distributed porphyrin units in these COFs endow them with enhanced performance in both photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and photocatalytic production of artemisinin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterization of porphyrin center regulated three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 2-fold interpenetrated &lt;b&gt;scu&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;sqc&lt;/b&gt; topology have been investigated. These COFs exhibit unique structural features and properties, making them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and artemisinin synthesis. The porphyrin center serves as an anchor for metal ions, allowing precise control over structures and functions of the frameworks. Furthermore, the metal coordination within the framework imparts desirable catalytic properties, enabling their potential use in photocatalytic reactions. Overall, these porphyrin center regulated metal-controlled COFs offer exciting opportunities for the development of advanced materials with tailored functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ratiometric Afterglow Luminescent Imaging of Matrix Metalloproteinase&#8208;2 Activity via an Energy Diversion Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MMP&#8208;2&#8208;activated and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;targeting ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) nanoprobe RAG&#8208;RGD is reported, which is constructed in adoption of energy diversion (ED) of excited&#8208;state afterglow substrate (AG&#8208;8*) and cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process.







Abstract
Ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) probes are attractive for in vivo imaging due to their high sensitivity and signal self&#8208;calibration function. However, there are currently few ratiometric AGL probes available for imaging enzymatic activity in living organisms. Here, we present an energy diversion (ED) strategy that enables the design of an enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric AGL probe (RAG&#8208;RGD) for in vivo afterglow imaging. The ED process provides RAG&#8208;RGD with a radiative transition for an &#8216;always on&#8217; 520&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL520) and a cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process for an &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; 710&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL710) in response to a specific enzyme. Using matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) as an example, RAG&#8208;RGD shows a significant ~11&#8208;fold increase in AGL710/AGL520 toward MMP&#8208;2. This can sensitively detect U87MG brain tumors through ratiometric afterglow imaging of MMP&#8208;2 activity, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep imaging depth. Furthermore, by utilizing the self&#8208;calibration effect of ratiometric imaging, RAG&#8208;RGD demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the AGL710/AGL520 value and the size of orthotopic U87MG tumor, enabling accurate monitoring of orthotopic glioma growth in vivo. This ED process may be applied for the design of other enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric afterglow probes for sensitive afterglow imaging.

         <title>Self&#8208;Inclusion Complexation of Electron&#8208;Accepting Guest into Electron&#8208;Donating Cyclic Host by Photoexcitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene bearing a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety exhibited dual locally excited and exciplex emissions from out&#8208;state and in&#8208;state, respectively, in the excited state. The addition of guest molecules suppressed formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state, resulting in observation of the single locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state.







Abstract
Self&#8208;inclusion complexes consisting of host&#8208;guest conjugates are one of the unique supramolecular structures because they form in&#8208;state and out&#8208;state depending on the external stimuli. Despite many reports of the stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;inclusion complex formation, study of the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation has been unexplored. Herein, we report that an electron&#8208;donating host and an electron&#8208;accepting guest conjugate exhibits the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation. Formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state resulted in exciplex emission along with the locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state. Moreover, this structural relaxation by photoexcitation was suppressed not only by temperature, but also by the presence of guest molecules, resulting in changes in the ratio of the dual emission intensities.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Formation of C&#8722;N or C=N Bond during Photocatalytic Reductive Coupling Reaction over CdS Nanosheets</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of C=N and C&#8722;N bonds was facilely achieved by manipulating the solvents via hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated transfer hydrogenation process over CdS photocatalyst.







Abstract
Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds and nitro compounds represents a straightforward way to attain imines or secondary amines, but it is difficult to control the product selectivity. Herein, we report the selective formation of C&#8722;N or C=N bond readily manipulated through a solvent&#8208;induced hydrogen bond bridge, facilitating the swift photocatalytic reductive coupling process. The reductive&#8208;coupling of nitro compounds with carbonyl compounds using formic acid and sodium formate as the hydrogen donors over CdS nanosheets selectively generates imines with C=N bonds in acetonitrile solvent; while taking methanol as solvent, the C=N bonds are readily hydrogenated to the C&#8722;N bonds via hydrogen&#8208;bonding activation. Experimental and theoretical study reveals that the building of the hydrogen&#8208;bond bridge between the hydroxyl groups in methanol and the N atoms of the C=N motifs in imines facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms from CdS surface to the N atoms in imines upon illumination, resulting in the rapid hydrogenation of the C=N bonds to give rise to the secondary amines with C&#8722;N bonds. Our method provides a simple way to control product selectivity by altering the solvents in photocatalytic organic transformations.

Iminium stencil. A cyclometallated imide exhibits a unique mode of action serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines. A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop the most selective and active catalysts described to date for the direct hydrogenation of this challenging class of substrates with up to 99&#8201;% ee and 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF.







Abstract
A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop overall the most selective catalyst for the direct hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl imines described to date. Iridium catalysts with a cyclometallated cyclic imide group provide selectivity of up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Computational studies show that the selectivity results from the combined effect of H&#8208;bonding of the imide C=O with the substrate iminium ion and a stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with the cyclometallated ligand. The cyclometallated ligand thus exhibits a unique mode of action, serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate which results in enhanced selectivity. The catalyst (2) has been synthesized and isolated as a crystalline air&#8208;stable solid. X&#8208;ray analysis of 2 confirmed the structure of the catalyst and the correct position of the imide C=O groups to engage in an H&#8208;bond with the substrate. 19F&#8197;NMR real&#8208;time monitoring showed the hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines catalyzed by 2 is very fast, with a TOF of approx. 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Micelles Cascade Assembly to Tandem Porous Catalyst for Waste Plastics Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle cascade assembly strategy is developed for synthesizing a tandem porous catalyst with hierarchical porous and acidic structures, which mimics natural protease catalytic clefts, exhibiting a high catalytic activity, selectivity and resistance to coking for the catalytic cracking of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) at a low temperature.







Abstract
Catalytic upcycling of polyolefins into high&#8208;value chemicals represents the direction in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization, but poses great challenges. Here, we report the synthesis of a tandem porous catalyst via a micelle cascade assembly strategy for selectively catalytic cracking of polyethylene into olefins at a low temperature. A hierarchically porous silica layer from mesopore to macropore is constructed on the surface of microporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanosheets through cascade assembly of dynamic micelles. The outer macropore arrays can adsorb bulky polyolefins quickly by the capillary and hydrophobic effects, enhancing the diffusion and access to active sites. The middle mesopores present a nanoconfinement space, pre&#8208;cracking polyolefins into intermediates by weak acid sites, which then transport into zeolites micropores for further cracking by strong Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The hierarchically porous and acidic structures, mimicking biomimetic protease catalytic clefts, ideally match the tandem cracking steps of polyolefins, thus suppressing coke formation and facilitating product escape. As a result, light hydrocarbons (C1&#8208;C7) are produced with a yield of 443&#8197;mmol&#8201;gZSM&#8208;5&#8722;1, where 74.3&#8201;% of them are C3&#8208;C6 olefins, much superior to ZSM&#8208;5 and porous silica catalysts. This tandem porous catalyst exemplifies a superstructure design of catalytic cracking catalysts for industrial and economical upcycling of plastic wastes.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with a Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Topology and High Electrical Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D conductive MOFs (named M&#8211;DHHBTN, M=Co, Ni, and Cu) with a unique ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring topology has been successfully constructed by using a highly branched and conjugated dodechydroxyhexabenzotrinaphthylene ligand, which offers the first example simultaneously achieving high electron conductivity and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;pore structure in 2D MOFs.







Abstract
Electrically conducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable structural tunability and outstanding electrical properties. However, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials face challenges due to the limited availability of specific ligands and pore structures. In this study, we have employed a novel highly branched D3h symmetrical planar conjugated ligand, dodechydroxylhexabenzotrinaphthylene (DHHBTN) to fabricate a series of 2D conductive MOFs, named M&#8211;DHHBTN (M=Co, Ni, and Cu). This new family of MOFs offers two distinct types of pores, elevating the structural complexity of 2D conductive MOFs to a more advanced level. The intricate tessellation patterns of the M&#8211;DHHBTN are elucidated through comprehensive analyses involving powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical simulations, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope. Optical&#8208;pump terahertz&#8208;probe spectroscopic measurements unveiled carrier mobility in DHHBTN&#8208;based 2D MOFs spanning from 0.69 to 3.10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Among M&#8211;DHHBTN famility, Cu&#8208;DHHBTN displayed high electrical conductivity reaching 0.21&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K with thermal activation behavior. This work leverages the &#8220;branched conjugation&#8221; of the ligand to encode heteroporosity into highly conductive 2D MOFs, underscoring the significant potential of heterogeneous double&#8208;pore structures for future applications.

Single crystals of a functional covalent organic polymer (COP, CityU&#8208;25) containing dative B&#8592;N bonds have been successfully prepared and their structure has been solved through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. CityU&#8208;25 as an anode in rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries displayed an excellent performance, evidenced by an impressive capacity of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g.







Abstract
Inspired by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds proven to be the promising dynamic linkage for the construction of crystalline covalent organic polymers/frameworks (COPs/COFs), we employed 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) benzene (BACT) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (DPNTCDI) as the corresponding building blocks to construct a functional COP (named as CityU&#8208;25), which had been employed as an anode in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. CityU&#8208;25 displayed an excellent reversible lithium storage capability of 455&#8197;mAh/g after 170 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A/g, and an impressive one of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g. These findings suggest that CityU&#8208;25 is a standout candidate for advanced battery technologies, highlighting the potential application of this type of materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient One&#8208;pot Electrosynthesis of Oxime Ethers from NOx over Ultrafine MgO Nanoparticles Derived from Mg&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

A novel tandem electrochemical system for converting exhaust NOx into oxime ether is proposed and presents great efficiency over a developed MgO derived from MOF anchoring in nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance of NOx valorization to synthesize organonitrogen drug molecules in a sustainable and mild way.







Abstract
Oxime ethers are attractive compounds in medicinal scaffolds due to the biological and pharmaceutical properties, however, the crucial and widespread step of industrial oxime formation using explosive hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is insecure and troublesome. Herein, we present a convenient method of oxime ether synthesis in a one&#8208;pot tandem electrochemical system using magnesium based metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived magnesium oxide anchoring in self&#8208;supporting carbon nanofiber membrane catalyst (MgO&#8208;SCM), the in situ produced NH2OH from nitrogen oxides electrocatalytic reduction coupled with aldehyde to produce 4&#8208;cyanobenzaldoxime with a selectivity of 93&#8201;% and Faraday efficiency up to 65.1&#8201;%, which further reacted with benzyl bromide to directly give oxime ether precipitate with a purity of 97&#8201;% by convenient filtering separation. The high efficiency was attributed to the ultrafine MgO nanoparticles in MgO&#8208;SCM, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerating the production of NH2OH, which rapidly attacked carbonyl of aldehydes to form oximes, but hardly crossed the hydrogenation barrier of forming amines, thus leading to a high yield of oxime ether when coupling benzyl bromide nucleophilic reaction. This work highlights the importance of kinetic control in complex electrosynthetic organonitrogen system and demonstrates a green and safe alternative method for synthesis of organic nitrogen drug molecules.

         <title>Cyclodextrin &#8216;Chaperones&#8217; Enable Quasi&#8208;Ideal Supramolecular Network Formation and Enhanced Photodimerization of Hydrophobic, Red&#8208;shifted Photoswitches in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrines serve as chaperones to solubilize and pre&#8208;order hydrophobic photoswitches with red&#8208;shifted activation wavelength in water, providing unique access to higher reactivity on a molecular scale and quasi&#8208;ideal hydrogel networks without phase segregation on the macroscale.







Abstract
Precision&#8208;engineered light&#8208;triggered hydrogels are important for a diversity of applications. However, fields such as biomaterials require wavelength outside the harsh UV regime to prevent photodamage, typically requiring chromophores with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation that suffer from poor water solubility. Herein, we demonstrate how cyclodextrins can be used as auxiliary agents to not only solubilize such chromophores, but even to preorganize them in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest inclusion complex to facilitate photodimerization. We apply our concept to styrylpyrene&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized star&#8208;shaped polyethylene glycols (sPEGs). We initially unravel details of the host&#8208;guest inclusion complex using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to give clear evidence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the resultant supramolecularly linked hydrogels conform to theories of supramolecular quasi&#8208;ideal model networks, and derive details on their association dynamics using in&#8208;depth rheological measurements and kinetic models. By comparing sPEGs of different arm length, we further elucidate the model network topology and the accessible mechanical property space. The photo&#8208;mediated dimerization proceeds smoothly, allowing to transform the supramolecular model networks into covalent ones. We submit that our strategy opens avenues for executing hydrophobic photochemistry in aqueous environments with enhanced control over reactivity, hydrogel topology or programmable mechanical properties.

         <title>Linker Mediated Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Conjugated Organic Polymers Enabling Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A viable linker engineering strategy is developed to construct a series of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers wrapped onto CNTs (CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) as pyrolysis&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By altering the electronic properties of organic linkers, the optimal CNTs@bTDA&#8208;CoPc&#8208;CPs confers outstanding performance for the ORR and zinc&#8208;air batteries, representing the high performance among reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts to date.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers with tailorable composition and microarchitecture are propitious for modulating catalytic properties and deciphering inherent structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we report a facile linker engineering strategy to manipulate the electronic states of metallophthalocyanine conjugated polymers and uncover the vital role of organic linkers in facilitating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, a set of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers (CoPc&#8208;CPs) wrapped onto carbon nanotubes (denoted CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) are judiciously crafted via in situ assembling square&#8208;planar cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoPc(NH2)4) with different linear aromatic dialdehyde&#8208;based organic linkers in the presence of CNTs. Intriguingly, upon varying the electronic characteristic of organic linkers from terephthalaldehyde (TA) to 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxaldehyde (TDA) and then to thieno/thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxaldehyde (bTDA), their corresponding CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs exhibit gradually improved electrocatalytic ORR performance. More importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer from CoPc units to electron&#8208;withdrawing linkers (i.e., TDA and bTDA) drives the delocalization of Co d&#8208;orbital electrons, thereby downshifting the Co d&#8208;band energy level. Accordingly, the active Co centers with more positive valence state exhibit optimized binding energy toward ORR&#8208;relevant intermediates and thus a balanced adsorption/desorption pathway that endows significant enhancement in electrocatalytic ORR. This work demonstrates a molecular&#8208;level engineering route for rationally designing efficient polymer catalysts and gaining insightful understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms.

         <title>An Integrative Chemical Recycling Approach for Catalytic Oxidation of Epoxy Resin and in situ Separation of Degraded Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new recycling strategy integrating catalytic oxidation of epoxy resin and in situ separation of degraded products is developed, where the interaction between iron catalyst and reaction solvent makes the degradation under mild condition, while the supramolecular interactions between degraded products and iron catalyst contribute to the separation of mixed degraded products, which provides new ideas for upcycling of mixed plastic wastes.







Abstract
Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on FeIV=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl2 with reaction reagents. As the FeIV=O radicals attacked the C&#8722;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the FeIV=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high&#8208;value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields via Molecular Symmetry Modulation in Supramolecular Photocatalysts for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the power of symmetry breaking, our supramolecular photocatalyst showcases outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and quantum yield. Our study not only positions SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ among the top performers in organic semiconductor photocatalysts but also demonstrates the method's effectiveness in boosting the efficiency of other catalysts, contributing to the advancement of solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are attractive photocatalysts, but their quantum yields are limited by poor charge separation and transportation. A promising strategy for efficient charge transfer is to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field by symmetry breaking. Herein, an unsymmetric protonation, N&#8208;heterocyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ was developed. The unsymmetric protonation breaks the initial structural symmetry of DADK, resulting in ca. 50&#8208;fold increase in the molecular dipole, and facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer within SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+. The protonation process also creates numerous active sites for H2O adsorption, and serves as crucial proton relays, significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency. Remarkably, SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ exhibits an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 278.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm, placing it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances in organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, the versatility of the unsymmetric protonation approach has been successfully applied to four other photocatalysts, enhancing their photocatalytic performance by 39 to 533&#8197;times. These findings highlight the considerable potential of unsymmetric protonation induced symmetry breaking strategy in tailoring supramolecular photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel production.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamidation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Azides: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic protocol to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under mild conditions. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) pathway in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical.







Abstract
The construction of C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds via direct N&#8208;centered radical addition with olefins under benign conditions is a desirable but challenging strategy. Herein, we describe an organo&#8208;photocatalytic approach to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. A broad range of substrates, including both activated and unactivated alkenes, are suitable for this protocol, providing a convenient and practical method to construct sulfonylamide derivatives. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests that the additive, Hantzsch ester (HE), might undergo a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer manner to achieve photosensitization by the organo&#8208;photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Next, the resulted triplet excited state 3HE* could lead to a homolytic cleavage of C4&#8722;H bond, which triggers a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) style in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical. Subsequently, the addition of the amidyl radical to alkene followed by HAT from p&#8208;toluenethiol could proceed to afford the desired anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation product. It is worth noting that mechanistic pathway bifurcation could be possible for this reaction. A feasible radical chain propagation mechanistic pathway is also proposed to rationalize the high efficiency of this reaction.

         <title>Coral&#8208;Inspired Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Bi&#8208;Stealth Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative coral&#8208;structure inspired multi&#8208;scale composite foam has been successfully fabricated, pioneering the development of terahertz&#8208;infrared bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin. This bi&#8208;stealth system exhibits intelligent electromagnetic protection through autonomous perception, adapting to diverse operational environments and task demands with real&#8208;time responsiveness. Concurrently, it achieves infrared stealth with dynamic ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The development of electronic skin with dual stealth functionality is crucial for enabling devices to operate effectively in dynamic electromagnetic environments, thereby facilitating intelligent electromagnetic protection for autonomous perception. However, achieving compatibility between terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) stealth technologies remains largely unexplored due to their inherent contradictions. Herein, inspired by natural corals, a novel coral&#8208;like multi&#8208;scale composite foam (CMSF) was proposed that ingeniously reconciles these contradictions. The design capitalizes on the conductive network and heat insulation properties of the foam skeleton, the loss effects and low infrared emission of metal particles, and the infrared transparency of magneto&#8208;optical materials. This approach leads to the realization of a THz&#8208;IR bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin concept. The CMSF exhibits a maximum reflection loss of 84.8&#8197;dB in the terahertz band, while its infrared stealth capability ensures environmental adaptability under varying temperatures. Furthermore, the electronic skin exhibits exceptional sensitivity and reliability as a wearable device for perceiving environmental changes. This advanced material, combining multispectral stealth with sensing capabilities, holds immense potential for applications ranging from camouflage technology to smart wearables.

         <title>Desulfurdioxidative N&#8208;N Coupling of N&#8208;Arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;Sulfinylanilines: Reaction Development and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a novel and practical strategy for N&#8722;N bond construction. The strategy involves an unprecedented intermolecular cascade O&#8208;sulfination and desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling (via stepwise retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition, supported by quantum chemistry calculations) from readily available N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines under metal and oxidant free conditions.







Abstract
A highly efficient and chemoselective approach for the divergent assembling of unsymmetrical hydrazines through an unprecedented intermolecular desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling is developed. This metal free protocol employs readily accessible N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines to provide highly valuable hydrazine products with good reaction yields and excellent functional group tolerance under simple conditions. Computational studies suggest that the in situ generated O&#8208;sulfenylated arylhydroxylamine intermediate undergoes a retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition via a stepwise diradical mechanism to form the N&#8722;N bond and release SO2.

         <title>M&#8722;N3 Configuration on Boron Nitride Boosts Singlet Oxygen Generation via Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites have been constructed via a vacancy control and coordination anchoring strategy, which overcome the difficulties in efficient and universal 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), thus achieving impressive selectivity and conversion rate for the transformation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an essential reactive species responsible for selective oxidation of organic matter, especially in Fenton&#8208;like processes. However, due to the great limitations in synthesizing catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites, the controllable production and practical application of 1O2 remain challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical simulations, a series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) were synthesized to regulate 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). All the fabricated BvBN/M catalysts with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites promoted the self&#8208;decomposition of the two PMS molecules to generate 1O2 with high selectivity, where BvBN/Co possessed moderate adsorption energy and d&#8208;band center exhibited superior catalytic activity. As an outcome, the BvBN/Co&#8208;PMS system coupled with membrane filtration technology could continuously transform aromatic alcohols to aldehydes with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity and conversion rate under mild conditions, suggesting the potential of this novel catalytic system for green organic synthesis.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Unconventional Phase Alloy Nanobranches for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize unconventional phase Ir&#8208;based alloy nanostrucrtures. Notably, hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi nanobranches demonstrate superior catalytic performance towards ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrite over the conventional phase counterpart. Mechanism studies reveal that Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to the highly selective formation of ammonia.







Abstract
The controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials with unconventional phases is of significant importance to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for various applications. However, it remains challenging to modulate the atomic arrangements of metal nanomaterials, especially the alloy nanostructures that involve different metals with distinct redox potentials. Here we report the general one&#8208;pot synthesis of IrNi, IrRhNi and IrFeNi alloy nanobranches with unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase. Notably, the as&#8208;synthesized hcp IrNi nanobranches demonstrate excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR), with superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.2&#8201;% and 34.6&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (75.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1) at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to a stronger reaction trend of NO2RR by greatly reducing energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining step.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials with unconventional phases is of significant importance to develop high-performance catalysts for various applications. However, it remains challenging to modulate the atomic arrangements of metal nanomaterials, especially the alloy nanostructures that involve different metals with distinct redox potentials. Here we report the general one-pot synthesis of IrNi, IrRhNi and IrFeNi alloy nanobranches with unconventional hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase. Notably, the as-synthesized hcp IrNi nanobranches demonstrate excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR), with superior NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.2&#8201;% and 34.6&#8197;mg&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (75.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to a stronger reaction trend of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR by greatly reducing energy barriers of rate-determining step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cascade Dearomatization of Indoles via a Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Bisfunctionalization of Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes has been disclosed. This process delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er).







Abstract
Photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed bisfunctionalization of butadienes with a readily available organic halide and a nucleophile represents an emerging and attractive method to assemble versatile alkenes bearing various functional groups at the allylic position. However, enantiocontrol and/or diastereocontrol in the C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bond&#8208;formation step have not been solved due to the open&#8208;shell process. Herein, we present a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoexcited Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes, wherein asymmetric control on both the nucleophile and electrophile part is achieved for the first time in photoinduced bisfunctionalization of butadienes. This method delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Experimental and computational studies of the mechanism have confirmed a radical pathway involving excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. The alignment and non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and the catalyst were found to be essential for stereocontrol.

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Enables Flexible&#8208;Robust Porosity for Highly Efficient Purification of Natural Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel flexible&#8208;robust HOF material with abundant supramolecular entanglements by weak intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds, enabling the construction of flexible&#8208;robust porosity to be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules for notably improving the C3H8/CH4 and n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 separation performance.







Abstract
The development of porous materials with flexible&#8208;robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a) with flexible&#8208;robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a features a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure with dia topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could not only stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility due to its weak intermolecular interactions (so&#8208;called flexible&#8208;robust framework). The flexible&#8208;robust porosity of ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a was exclusively confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules rather by C2H6 and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6 over CH4 under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 selectivities. The gas&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n&#8208;C4H10 can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n&#8208;C4H10 uptake and selectivity, while not for C2H6 adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible&#8208;robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.

Valuable formamides were &#8220;pulled out of the hat&#8221; upon reaction of amines with biomass&#8208;based starting materials such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glycolaldehyde and glycerolaldehyde by avoiding any waste products using environmentally benign oxygen as oxidant, as reported by Haijun Jiao, Feng Shi, Jabor Rabeah, Angelika Br&#252;ckner et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402241). This reaction may be regarded as &#8220;green&#8221; and somehow &#8220;magic".

Enantiopure irida[6]helicenes combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment are obtained by dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile [4]helicenic ligands. These compounds exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals, as described by Carlos M. Cruz, Fernando P. Coss&#237;o, Zoraida Freixa, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202406663).

         <title>Quantitative Factors Introduced in the Feasibility Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Sensitive Triggers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Success of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) triggered prodrug activation relies on two key functions: (1) sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and the intended site of delivery, (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of payload release. Herein, we examine ROS concentrations under various pathophysiological conditions and critically analyze ROS&#8208;triggered prodrug.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for cellular signaling. Various pathophysiological conditions are also associated with elevated levels of ROS. Hence, ROS&#8208;sensitive triggers have been extensively used for selective payload delivery. Such applications are predicated on two key functions: (1) a sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and intended sites and (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity for payload release. Further, ROS refers to a group of species with varying reactivity, which should not be viewed as a uniform group. In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS&#8208;sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS&#8208;triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.

         <title>The 18F&#8208;Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook</title>

This Minireview summarises the progress radiochemists have made to access the difluoromethyl group in radiolabelled form. Particular attention is given to challenges they have faced, as well as the strategies employed to access this new radiochemical space.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user&#8208;friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access 18F&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on 18F&#8208;fluorination. A second approach consists of a 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation process, which uses 18F&#8208;labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [18F]CF2H radical or [18F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [18F]CF2H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.

         <title>Reaction Environment Regulation for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes, focusing on engineering reaction environments. It discusses strategies for electrocatalyst design, electrode modification, and electrolyte optimization to enhance CO2RR while suppressing hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.

Chemistry has the potential to drive global sustainability efforts, but how to ensure its optimal impact is not always obvious. Through analysis of green, circular, and sustainable chemistry concepts, this Scientific Perspective identifies unified triple&#8197;E priorities, covering environmental, economic, and equity pillars, and categorizes associated metrics. Case studies illustrate how these can be used to guide research and decisions.







Abstract
Chemistry, a vital tool for sustainable development, faces a challenge due to the lack of clear guidance on actionable steps, hindering the optimal adoption of sustainability practices across its diverse facets from discovery to implementation. This Scientific Perspective explores established frameworks and principles, proposing a conciliated set of triple&#8197;E priorities anchored on Environmental, Economic, and Equity pillars for research and decision making. We outline associated metrics, crucial for quantifying impacts, classifying them according to their focus areas and scales tackled. Emphasizing catalysis as a key driver of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and materials, we exemplify how triple&#8197;E priorities can practically guide the development and implementation of processes from renewables conversions to complex customized products. We summarize by proposing a roadmap for the community aimed at raising awareness, fostering academia&#8211;industry collaboration, and stimulating further advances in sustainable chemical technologies across their broad scope.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation En Route to N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazones with internal alkynes is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N atropisomers were synthesized with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reactions triggered by the extrusion of small gaseous molecules have emerged as a powerful strategy for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds. However, their use in asymmetric synthesis remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by the denitrogenative transannulation of benzotriazones with alkynes. A broad range of N&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity control.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Secretoglobin 3A2 Covalent Homodimer and Photocaged Monomeric Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a small, secreted protein present only in mammals. Despite its unique self&#8208;assembly driven by disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization, current understanding of its physiology relies solely on in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures. SCGB3A2 chemical synthesis using KAHA ligation now enables access to monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues for studying its self&#8208;assembly behavior.







Abstract
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 belongs to an intriguing family of small, secreted proteins present only in mammals. Although members of the SCGB protein family have distinct amino acid sequences, they share structural similarities. Of particularly interest is the not yet fully understood self&#8208;assembly ability of SCGBs, which arise from covalent disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization. Recently, SCGB3A2 has attracted attention for its singular expression profile in airways. However, the knowledge on SCGB3A2 (patho)physiology derives exclusively from in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures, which hampers characterization of the mechanisms driving SCGB3A2 structural behavior. Herein, we document the chemical synthesis of SCGB3A2 in multi&#8208;milligram quantities. Key to access both monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues was the use of KAHA ligation and enabled masking of the cysteine residue. The synthetic proteins were used to investigate the SCGB3A2 self&#8208;assembly profile, confirming their high propensity to dimerization even in the absence of the key Cys residue.

However, the knowledge on SCGB3A2 (patho)physiology derives exclusively from in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures, which hampers characterization of the mechanisms driving SCGB3A2 structural behavior. Herein, we document the chemical synthesis of SCGB3A2 in multi-milligram quantities. Key to access both monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues was the use of KAHA ligation and enabled masking of the cysteine residue. The synthetic proteins were used to investigate the SCGB3A2 self-assembly profile, confirming their high propensity to dimerization even in the absence of the key Cys residue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DOTA&#8208;Based Plectin&#8208;1 Targeted Contrast Agent Enables Detection of Pancreatic Cancer in Human Tissue</title>

         <dc:description>
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest survival rates which is related to the lack of diagnostic tools for early detection. In this study, we developed a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 that significantly improves imaging of PDAC in human tissue and in vivo. These results demonstrate the great potential of the probe to enable early PDAC diagnosis.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy with extremely poor patient survival rates. A key reason for the poor prognosis is the lack of effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at curable, premetastatic stages. Tumor surgical resection is PDAC's first&#8208;line treatment, however distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissue with current imaging tools remains a challenge. In this work, we report a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 for imaging PDAC with high specificity. To enable heterogeneous functionalization of the DOTA&#8208;core with multiple targeting peptide units and the fluorophore, a novel, fully clickable synthetic route that proceeds in one pot was developed. Extensive validation of the probe set the stage for PDAC detection in mice and human tissue. Altogether, these findings may pave the way for improved clinical understanding and early detection of PDAC progression as well as more accurate resection criteria.

The unprecedented ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage functionalization with easily accessible sulfonium salts enabled the C&#8722;H arylation of medicinally relevant N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles.







Abstract
The late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients is a key challenge in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles are important structural motifs with the potential to boost the activity of diverse drug molecules. Using easily accessible dibenzothiophenium salts for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, these scaffolds were introduced into a variety of bioactive compounds. Our methodology uses cost&#8208;efficient ruthenium, KOAc as a mild base and gives access to a plethora of highly decorated triazole and tetrazole containing drug derivatives.

         <title>Accessing Z&#8208;Enynes via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective propargylic dehydrogenation is described. Alkynes and allenes are transformed to 1,3&#8208;enynes with moderate Z&#8208;selectivity. Deprotonation is identified as rate&#8208;limiting, and the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect.







Abstract
Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. Z&#8208;alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of E&#8208;alkenes compared to Z&#8208;alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form Z&#8208;alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a Z&#8208;selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3&#8208;enynes through the invention of a Co&#8208;catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the Z&#8208;selectivity is included.

         <title>Photogeneration of Chlorine Radical from a Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorous 4CzIPN&#8226;Chloride Complex: Application in C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorous photoredox catalyst 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN (Rf8=C8F17) forms a supramolecular complex with chloride ions with high affinity. Integrating fluorous chains on the parent dye greatly enhances both the ion&#8208;binding affinity, as well as the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Efficient photooxidation of the chloride was observed, generating the chlorine HAT reagent, which was tested in the redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reaction.







Abstract
The chlorine radical is a strong HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) agent that is very useful for the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Albeit highly attractive, its generation from the poorly oxidizable chloride ion mediated by an excited photoredox catalyst is a difficult task. We now report that 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN, an electron&#8208;deficient fluorous derivative of the benchmark 4CzIPN photoredox catalyst belonging to the donor&#8208;acceptor carbazole&#8208;cyanoarene family, is not only a better photooxidant than 4CzIPN, but also becomes an excellent host for the chloride ion. Combining these two properties ultimately makes the self&#8208;assembled 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN&#8226;Cl&#8722; dual catalyst highly reactive in redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reactions promoted by the chlorine radical. Additionally, because of its fluorous character, the efficient separation/recovery of 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN could be envisioned.

Pulling fluorine off: The unusually high activity of the C&#8722;F bond found in the homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; is correlated to the very low fluoride&#8208;ion affinity of the conjugate difluorocarbene complex [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722;, which is experimentally detected. Selective single, double or triple defluorination of a CF3 group is achieved under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; (1) is shown to be highly active towards amines. Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH2, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF3 ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CNR)]&#8722; (R=aryl). In this process the original CF3 group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of 1 with secondary amines R2NH proceeds with loss of just two F&#8208;substituents, whereby the Fischer&#8208;type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CFNR2)]&#8722; are formed (R=Et, Ph). The reaction of 1 with diamines affords different [(CF3)3Pd(NHC)]&#8722; complexes containing sterically non&#8208;demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene rings as well as the expanded&#8208;ring perimidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. This metal&#8208;tailored synthetic route, where a CF3 group acts as a pre&#8208;carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC&#8208;chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non&#8208;isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722; is experimentally detected.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Sensor Based on Steric Hindrance Regulated Molecular Packing for In Vivo Epilepsy Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescence sensing mechanism is presented by using steric hindrance quenchers to regulate the molecular packing state of fluorophores. The ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice brain is visualized by the SHINE sensor.







Abstract
Fluorescence sensing is crucial to studying biological processes and diagnosing diseases, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window with reduced background signals. However, it's still a great challenge to construct &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensors when the sensing wavelength extends into the NIR&#8208;II region to obtain higher imaging contrast, mainly due to the difficult synthesis of spectral overlapped quencher. Here, we present a new fluorescence quenching strategy, which utilizes steric hindrance quencher (SHQ) to tune the molecular packing state of fluorophores and suppress the emission signal. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that large SHQs can competitively pack with fluorophores and prevent their self&#8208;aggregation. Based on this quenching mechanism, a novel activatable &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensing method is achieved via bio&#8208;analyte responsive invalidation of SHQ, namely the Steric Hindrance Invalidation geNerated Emission (SHINE) strategy. As a proof of concept, the ClO&#8722;&#8208;sensitive SHQ lead to the bright NIR&#8208;II signal release in epileptic mouse hippocampus under the skull and high photon scattering brain tissue, providing the real&#8208;time visualization of ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice.

         <title>Umbrella&#8208;Shaped Amphiphiles: Internal Alkylation of an Aromatic Micelle and Its Impact on Cavity Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internally multi&#8208;alkylated aromatic micelles are assembled in water from umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles featuring a linear alkyl chain flanked by two polyaromatic panels. The alkylation strongly enhances the stability of the novel micelles against dilution and heat. Notably, thanks to the softness of the fully alkyl&#8208;filled cavity, efficient uptake of large metallodyes and pseudorotaxane&#8208;like binding of cycloparaphenylenes is achieved.







Abstract
To develop new hybrid micelles with alkyl/polyaromatic core&#8211;shell structures, we synthesized umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles bearing a bent anthracene dimer with a linear alkyl chain (i.e., octyl and hexadecyl groups). The amphiphiles quantitatively assemble into spherical micelles (~2&#8211;3&#8197;nm in core diameter), possessing an alkylated cavity surrounded by a polyaromatic framework, in water. The alkylation significantly enhances the stability of the micellar structures against dilution (up to 9&#8197;&#956;M) and heat (up to &gt;120&#8201;&#176;C). The highly condensed hexadecyl core of the hybrid micelle, as indicated by solvatochromic guest probes, displays increased uptake ability toward large alkylated metallodyes. Interestingly, efficient uptake of aromatic macrocycles (i.e., [n]cycloparaphenylenes) by the present micelle provides pseudorotaxane&#8208;shaped host&#8211;guest composites with high emissivity (&#934;F=up to 35&#8201;%). Internal multi&#8208;alkylation of an aromatic micelle can thus successfully enhance its assembly stability/guest uptake functions.

         <title>Organometallic Chirality Sensing via &#8220;Click&#8221;&#8208;Like &#951;6&#8208;Arene Coordination with an Achiral Cp*Ru(II) Piano Stool Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with a readily available ruthenium piano stool complex and its use in an optical CD/UV relay assay allow time&#8208;efficient chromatography&#8208;free stereochemical analysis of a broad range of challenging molecules.







Abstract
Piano stool complexes have been studied over many years and found widespread applications in organic synthesis, catalysis, materials and drug development. We now report the first examples of quantitative chiroptical molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with readily available half sandwich complexes. This conceptually new approach to chirality sensing is based on irreversible acetonitrile displacement of [Cp*Ru(CH3CN)3]PF6 by an aromatic target molecule, a process that is fast and complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The metal coordination coincides with characteristic circular dichroism inductions that can be easily correlated to the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio of the bound molecule. A relay assay that decouples the determination of the enantiomeric composition and of the total sample amount by a practical CD/UV measurement protocol was developed and successfully tested. The introduction of piano stool complexes to the chiroptical sensing realm is mechanistically unique and extends the scope of currently known methods with small&#8208;molecule probes that require the presence of amino, alcohol, carboxylate or other privileged functional groups for binding of the target compound. A broad application range including pharmaceutically relevant multifunctional molecules and the use in chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis are also demonstrated.

         <title>Linkage Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic C2H4 Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are constructed by linkage engineering to efficiently catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalytic array structure composed of sp3 N sites in the aminal linkages promotes CO2 capture and enhances the reaction kinetics for C2H4 production, thus showing a much higher Faraday efficiency of C2H4 than imine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal&#8208;free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high&#8208;density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal&#8208;linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1&#8201;%, which is stand out in all reported metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine&#8208;linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are constructed by linkage engineering to efficiently catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). The catalytic array structure composed of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; N sites in the aminal linkages promotes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and enhances the reaction kinetics for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production, thus showing a much higher Faraday efficiency of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; than imine-linked COFs.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to produce ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal-free catalysis remains a challenge.

         <title>Blocking Interfacial Proton Transport via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) for HER&#8208;free zinc anodes by anchoring ionic liquid (BMIM+) cations on Ti3C2Tx (MXene) substrate. The BMIM+ with a high coordination number of water molecules can significantly reduce the interfacial densities of H2O molecules. Therefore, the SAM can disrupt the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and hinder proton transport at the interface, suppressing HER.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, yet suffer from the issues of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and intricate side reactions on the Zn anode surface. The hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond networks play a critical role in interfacial proton transport that may closely relate to HER but are rarely investigated. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy which is constructed by anchoring ionic liquid cations on Ti3C2Tx substrate for HER&#8208;free Zn anode. Molecule dynamics simulations reveal that the rationally designed SAM with a high coordination number of water molecules (25&#8211;27, 4&#8211;6 for Zn2+) largely reduces the interfacial densities of H2O molecules, therefore breaking the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and blocking proton transport on the interface, by which the HER is suppressed. Then, a series of in situ characterizations demonstrate that negligible amounts of H2 gas are collected from the Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene anode. Consequently, the symmetric cell enables a long&#8208;cycling life of 3000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the stable Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene films are successfully used for coin full cells showing high&#8208;capacity retention of over 94&#8201;% after 1000 cycles and large&#8208;area (10&#215;5&#8197;cm2) pouch cells with desired performance.

         <title>Expedient Access to 18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes via Deaminative Radiofluorination of Aniline&#8208;Derived Pyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes find wide application as radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Here, we present a deaminative radiosynthetic approach via pyridinium tetrafluoroborates that facilitates radiofluorination of 33 structurally diverse heteroarenes in up to 98&#8201;% RCY (radiochemical yield). This method was also amenable to automation and was successfully translated to an automated synthesiser.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that pyridinium salts derived from abundant (hetero)anilines represent a novel precursor class for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions with [18F]fluoride. The value of this new 18F&#8208;fluorodeamination is demonstrated with the synthesis of over 30 structurally diverse and complex heteroaryl 18F&#8208;fluorides, several derived from scaffolds that were yet to be labelled with fluorine&#8208;18. The protocol tolerates heteroarenes and functionalities commonly found in drug discovery libraries, and is amenable to scale&#8208;up and automation on a commercial radiosynthesiser.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Selective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyridines and Isoquinolines through Dearomatized Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated pyridines are prepared via bench stable oxazino pyridine intermediates with unsymmetrical iodonium salts using Cu&#8208;catalysis. The strategy can be applied for meta&#8208;alkenylation upon simply switching to the corresponding alkenyl I(III) reagents and both C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalizations also work on isoquinolines.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization offers an efficient strategy for the synthesis of various elaborated N&#8208;containing heteroarenes. Along these lines, oxazino pyridines that can be readily prepared from pyridines, have been introduced as powerful substrates in radical&#8208; and ionic&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. However, the regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines remains a great challenge. Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines and isoquinolines through bench&#8208;stable dearomatized intermediates is reported. Electrophilic aryl&#8208;Cu(III) species, generated from readily accessible aryl I(III) reagents, enable the efficient meta&#8208;arylation of a broad range of pyridines and isoquinolines. The method also allows the meta&#8208;selective alkenylation of these heteroarenes using the corresponding alkenyl I(III)&#8208;reagents. Late&#8208;stage arylation of drug&#8208;derived pyridines and larger&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential of this synthetic methodology.

         <title>One&#8208;Component Cationic Lipids for Systemic mRNA Delivery to Splenic T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that predominantly target the liver and possess complex constituents, we designed simplified one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipid/mRNA nanoparticles (CLNs) for extrahepatic mRNA delivery. These CLNs facilitated mRNA expression in the spleen and T cells, demonstrating substantial potential for immunotherapy applications.







Abstract
Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non&#8208;liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine&#8208;based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications. This straightforward strategy extends the utility of lipid family for extrahepatic mRNA delivery, offering new insights into vector development beyond LNPs to further the field of precise mRNA therapy.

These CLNs facilitated mRNA expression in the spleen and T cells, demonstrating substantial potential for immunotherapy applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non-liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one-component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine-based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications. This straightforward strategy extends the utility of lipid family for extrahepatic mRNA delivery, offering new insights into vector development beyond LNPs to further the field of precise mRNA therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Boosted Hydronium Intercalation: A Paradigm Shift in Aluminum&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets are rich in oxygen defects, which tilt the adsorption effect of Al3+ and effectively inhibit further insertion/diffusion of Al3+. This phenomenon leaves space for H3O+ insertion, allowing it to insert into the lattice smoothly.







Abstract
In aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the insertion/extraction chemistry of Al3+ often leads to poor kinetics, whereas the rapid diffusion kinetics of hydronium ions (H3O+) may offer the solution. However, the presence of considerable Al3+ in the electrolyte hinders the insertion reaction of H3O+. Herein, we report how oxygen&#8208;deficient &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets unlock selective H3O+ insertion in a mild aluminum&#8208;ion electrolyte. The abundant oxygen defects impede the insertion of Al3+ due to excessively strong adsorption, while allowing H3O+ to be inserted/diffused through the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. This research advances our understanding of the mechanism behind selective H3O+ insertion in mild electrolytes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Inward Isomerization Hydroaminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization and hydraminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides has been developed. The combination isomerization&#8208;responsible catalyst and hydrocarbonylation&#8208;responsible catalyst was found to be a highly effective strategy to render the reaction feasible. The reaction shows highly functional group compatibility and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
In contrast to the kinetically favored outward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, the disfavored inward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes remains an important challenge. Herein, we have developed a novel and effective palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes and aniline hydrochlorides for the formation of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides in high yields and high site&#8208;selectivities. The high efficiency of the reaction is attributed to a relay catalysis strategy, in which the Markovnikov&#8208;favored [PdH]&#8208;PtBu3 catalyst is responsible for inward isomerization, while the [PdH]&#8208;Ruphos catalyst is responsible for hydroaminocarbonylation of the resulting conjugated aryl alkenes. The reaction exhibits highly functional group tolerance and provides a new method for formal carbonylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Enantiopure [6]&#8208;Azairidahelicene by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of a Configurationally Labile [4]&#8208;Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes, combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment, are readily accessible by an effective dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand. The two isolated enantiomers exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals.







Abstract
A pair of enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes incorporating chirality at the metal center and on the helicenic ligand were synthesized by dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand (4&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;benzo[g]phenanthrene, L1H) using bis&#8208;cyclometalated chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal only iridium(III) precursors as chiral inductors. The origin of the observed dkr is attributed to the different conformation and stability of diastereomeric reaction intermediates formed during the cyclometalation process. The isolated enantiomers exhibited circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), with |gphos| values of 1.8&#215;10&#8722;3.
