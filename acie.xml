         <title>The S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Is Critical for Substrate Selectivity and Can Be Targeted with Covalent Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) is a well&#8208;characterized target for antiviral drug discovery. To date, most antiviral drug discovery efforts have focused on the S4&#8208;S1&#8217; pocket of Mpro; however, it is still unclear whether the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket per se can serve as a new site for drug discovery. In this study, the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket of Mpro was found to differentially recognize viral peptidyl substrates; for instance, S3&#8217; in Mpro strongly favors Phe or Trp, and S1&#8217; favors Ala. The peptidyl inhibitor D&#8208;4&#8208;77, which possesses an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead, was discovered to be a promising inhibitor of Mpro, with an IC50 of 0.95&#160;&#181;M and an antiviral EC50 of 0.49 &#181;M. The Mpro/inhibitor co&#8208;crystal structure confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitor to the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket and revealed a covalent mechanism. In addition, D&#8208;4&#8208;77 functions as an immune protectant and suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro&#8208;induced antagonism of the host NF&#8208;&#954;B innate immune response. These findings indicate that the S1&#8217;&#8208;S3&#8217; pocket of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro is druggable, and moreover, inhibiting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro can simultaneously protect human innate immunity and inhibit virion assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonate Hydrogenated to Formate in the Aqueous Phase over Nickel/TiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonate hydrogenation to formate is a promising route to utilize captured carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals, thus reducing carbon emissions and creating a revenue return. Developing inexpensive catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability remains challenging. We report a supported non&#8208;noble metal catalyst, Ni/TiO2, with great selectivity over 96% and excellent stability in catalyzing the conversion of carbonate into formate in aqueous solution. Ni0 and Ni2+ species are both observed in Ni/TiO2 catalysts, and the synergistic effect of these two Ni components leads to high activity and high selectivity of carbonate hydrogenation to formate.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Modification of Cycloparaphenylene by Catenane Formation Using an Active Metal Template Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active metal template (AMT) strategy is a powerful tool for the formation of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes and catenanes, allowing the synthesis of a variety of MIMs, including &#960;&#8208;conjugated and multicomponent macrocycles. Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) is an emerging molecule characterized by its cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and unique properties. Therefore, diverse modifications of CPPs are expected for its wide application. However, most CPP modifications require early&#8208;stage functionalization and the direct modification of CPPs is very limited. Herein, we report the synthesis of a catenane consisting of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle as a new CPP analogue that contains a reliable synthetic scaffold enabling diverse and concise post&#8208;modification. Following the AMT strategy, [9]CPP&#8211;bipyridine catenane was successfully synthesized through Ni&#8208;mediated aryl&#8211;aryl coupling. Catalytic C&#8211;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation at bipyridine macrocycle moiety, an effective post&#8208;functionalization method, were also demonstrated with [9]CPP&#8211;bipyridine catenane. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed that the [9]CPP&#8211;bipyridine catenane forms a tridentated complex with an Ag ion inside the CPP ring. This interaction significantly enhances phosphorescence lifetime through improved intermolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into the Carbon&#8208;Iodine Bond of Heteroaryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed aryne insertion into heteroaryl C&#8722;I bonds to access valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls, characterized by high efficiency and selectivity, has first been realized. The newly discovered Lewis acid catalyzed insertion model opens up numerous opportunities for the further development of aryne chemistry.







Abstract
Aryne insertions into the carbon&#8208;iodine bond of heteroaryl iodides has been achieved for the first time. This novel reaction provides an efficient pathway for the synthesis of valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls from heteroaryl iodides and o&#8208;silylaryl triflates in excellent regioselectivity. The copper(I) catalyst, which bears a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, is essential to accomplish the reaction. Control reactions and DFT calculations indicate that the coordination of copper, as a Lewis acid, with nitrogen atoms of heteroaryl iodides mediates the insertion of arynes into heteroaryl carbon&#8208;iodine bonds.

         <title>Bulk Passivation Enables Hundredfold&#8208;Enhanced Electroluminescence of Monophosphine Cu4I4 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster light&#8208;emitting diode based on a monodentate&#8208;ligand&#8208;based Cu4I4 cube realized a record luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) beyond 104&#8197;nits and 15&#8201;%, respectively, owing to a bulky passivation effect of the active host matrix through non&#8208;covalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu interactions, which markedly reduces nonradiative decay, leading to a doubled photoluminescence quantum yield of the film (99&#8201;%) and a 100&#8208;fold and sevenfold increased luminance and EQE of the devices, respectively.







Abstract
Electroluminescent (EL) clusters emerged rapidly, owing to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid character useful for comprehensive performance integration and the potential for large&#8208;scale display and lighting applications. However, despite their good photoluminescent (PL) properties, until present, no efficient EL monodentate ligand&#8208;based clusters were reported due to structural variation during processing and excitation and exciton confinement on cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Here we demonstrate an effective bulky passivation strategy for efficient cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes with a monophosphine Cu4I4 cube named [TMeOPP]4Cu4I4. With terminal pyridine groups, an active matrix named TmPyPB supports an effective host&#8208;cluster interplay for configuration fixation, structural stabilization, and exciton&#8208;confinement optimization. Compared to common inactive hosts, the passivation effects of TmPyPB markedly reduce trap&#8208;state densities by 24&#8211;40&#8201;% to suppress nonradiative decay, resulting in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PL and EL quantum yields reaching 99&#8201;% and 15.6&#8201;%, respectively, which are significantly improved by about 7&#8208;fold. TmPyPB simultaneously increases EL luminance to 104 nits, which is &#8776;100&#8208;fold that of the non&#8208;doped analogue.

&lt;p&gt;A cluster light-emitting diode based on a monodentate-ligand-based Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cube realized a record luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) beyond 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;nits and 15&#8201;%, respectively, owing to a bulky passivation effect of the active host matrix through non-covalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu interactions, which markedly reduces nonradiative decay, leading to a doubled photoluminescence quantum yield of the film (99&#8201;%) and a 100-fold and sevenfold increased luminance and EQE of the devices, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroluminescent (EL) clusters emerged rapidly, owing to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid character useful for comprehensive performance integration and the potential for large-scale display and lighting applications. However, despite their good photoluminescent (PL) properties, until present, no efficient EL monodentate ligand-based clusters were reported due to structural variation during processing and excitation and exciton confinement on cluster-centered quenching states. Here we demonstrate an effective bulky passivation strategy for efficient cluster light-emitting diodes with a monophosphine Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cube named [TMeOPP]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. With terminal pyridine groups, an active matrix named TmPyPB supports an effective host-cluster interplay for configuration fixation, structural stabilization, and exciton-confinement optimization. Compared to common inactive hosts, the passivation effects of TmPyPB markedly reduce trap-state densities by 24&#8211;40&#8201;% to suppress nonradiative decay, resulting in state-of-the-art PL and EL quantum yields reaching 99&#8201;% and 15.6&#8201;%, respectively, which are significantly improved by about 7-fold. TmPyPB simultaneously increases EL luminance to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; nits, which is &#8776;100-fold that of the non-doped analogue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benzotriazole&#8208;Based 3D Four&#8208;Arm Small Molecules Enable 19.1&#8201;% Efficiency for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;Based Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>

We synthesized three 3D four&#8208;arm small molecules with spirobifluorene as the central core and different end&#8208;group&#8208;modified benzotriazole units as arms. By incorporating four&#8208;arm molecules, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved improved efficiencies of 18.7&#8211;19.1&#8201;%, benefiting from triggered multiple mechanisms and the inhibited excessive aggregation of Y6. Our results open a new avenue for the design of promising guest molecules for ternary OSCs.







Abstract
A third component featuring a planar backbone structure similar to the binary host molecule has been the preferred ingredient for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we explored a new avenue that introduces 3D&#8208;structured molecules as guest acceptors. Spirobifluorene (SF) is chosen as the core to combine with three different terminal&#8208;modified (rhodanine, thiazolidinedione, and dicyano&#8208;substituted rhodanine) benzotriazole (BTA) units, affording three four&#8208;arm molecules, SF&#8208;BTA1, SF&#8208;BTA2, and SF&#8208;BTA3, respectively. After adding these three materials to the classical system PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, the resulting ternary devices obtained ultra&#8208;high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.1&#8201;%, 18.7&#8201;%, and 18.8&#8201;%, respectively, compared with the binary OSCs (PCE=17.4&#8201;%). SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 can work as energy donors to increase charge generation via energy transfer. In addition, the charge transfer between PM6 and SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 also acts to enhance charge generation. Introducing SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 could form acceptor alloys to modify the molecular energy level and inhibit the self&#8208;aggregation of Y6, thereby reducing energy loss and balancing charge transport. Our success in 3D multi&#8208;arm materials as the third component shows good universality and brings a new perspective. The further functional development of multi&#8208;arm materials could make OSCs more stable and efficient.

         <title>A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru Composition Space
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using combinations of machine&#8208;learning inferred input features and different prediction models, the measured catalytic activity of 1582 complex solid solution alloys within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru composition space was predicted. The results show multiple approaches converging on the same understanding of the underlying catalytic theory and demonstrate a viable strategy using high&#8208;entropy materials for catalyst discovery.







Abstract
Compositionally complex materials such as high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor&#8208;activity relationship, as experimentally screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross&#8208;validated mean absolute error of 0.042&#8197;mA/cm2 by applying a theory&#8208;derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high&#8208;entropy materials.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Sb2F10 in the Chemical Synthesis of F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the chemical synthesis of F2 has been elucidated by experimental and electronic structure theory methods. The elimination of F2 from MnF4 requires a large excess of SbF5 occurring in the last reaction step by addition of SbF5 to the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11]&#8722; anion producing F2 and crystalline Mn[Sb2F11]2.







Abstract
The purely chemical synthesis of fluorine is a spectacular reaction which for more than a century had been believed to be impossible. In 1986, it was finally experimentally achieved, but since then this important reaction has not been further studied and its detailed mechanism had been a mystery. The known thermal stability of MnF4 casts serious doubts on the originally proposed hypothesis that MnF4 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to a lower manganese fluoride and F2. This apparent discrepancy has now been resolved experimentally and by electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the reductive elimination of F2 requires a large excess of SbF5 and occurs in the last reaction step when in the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11] the addition of one more SbF5 molecule to the [SbF6]&#8722; anion generates a second tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anion. The two tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anions then provide six fluorine bridges to the Mn atom thereby facilitating the reductive elimination of the two fluorine ligands as F2.

         <title>Electroreductive Radical Borylation of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Without Light by Using Cumulene&#8208;Based Redox Mediators
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically promoted functionalization of unactivated chloroarenes without light is achieved by using novel tetraarylcumulene&#8208;based redox mediators.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) plays a critical role in many chemical processes, from organic synthesis to environmental remediation. However, the selective reduction of inert substrates (Ep/2&lt;&#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+), such as ubiquitous electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich (hetero)aryl chlorides, remains a major challenge. Current approaches largely rely on catalyst photoexcitation to reach the necessary deeply reducing potentials or suffer from limited substrate scopes. Herein, we demonstrate that cumulenes&#8211;organic molecules with multiple consecutive double bonds&#8211;can function as catalytic redox mediators for the electroreductive radical borylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides at relatively mild cathodic potentials (approximately &#8722;1.9&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) without the need for photoirradiation. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies support that step&#8208;wise electron transfer from reduced cumulenes to electron&#8208;neutral chloroarenes is followed by thermodynamically favorable mesolytic cleavage of the aryl radical anion to generate the desired aryl radical intermediate. Our findings will guide the development of other sustainable, purely electroreductive radical transformations of inert molecules using organic redox mediators.

&lt;sub&gt;p/2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;&#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), such as ubiquitous electron-neutral and electron-rich (hetero)aryl chlorides, remains a major challenge. Current approaches largely rely on catalyst photoexcitation to reach the necessary deeply reducing potentials or suffer from limited substrate scopes. Herein, we demonstrate that cumulenes&#8211;organic molecules with multiple consecutive double bonds&#8211;can function as catalytic redox mediators for the electroreductive radical borylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides at relatively mild cathodic potentials (approximately &#8722;1.9&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) without the need for photoirradiation. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies support that step-wise electron transfer from reduced cumulenes to electron-neutral chloroarenes is followed by thermodynamically favorable mesolytic cleavage of the aryl radical anion to generate the desired aryl radical intermediate. Our findings will guide the development of other sustainable, purely electroreductive radical transformations of inert molecules using organic redox mediators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast Water Transport in UTSA&#8208;280 via a Knock&#8208;Off Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique water transport mechanism is investigated in the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UTSA&#8208;280. An incoming water molecule can replace a coordinated molecule, referred to as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. UTSA&#8208;280 has 1D channels but the knock&#8208;off transport enables water diffusion along the other two dimensions, mimicking a pseudo&#8208;3D mass transfer. As a result, the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane has a high diffusion selectivity of water over ethanol.







Abstract
Water and other small molecules frequently coordinate within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). These coordinated molecules may actively engage in mass transfer, moving together with the transport molecules, but this phenomenon has yet to be examined. In this study, we explore a unique water transfer mechanism in UTSA&#8208;280, where an incoming water molecule can displace a coordinated molecule for mass transfer. We refer to this process as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. Despite UTSA&#8208;280 possessing one&#8208;dimensional channels, the knock&#8208;off transport enables water movement along the other two axes, effectively simulating a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional mass transfer. Even with a relatively narrow pore width, the knock&#8208;off mechanism enables a high water flux in the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane. The knock&#8208;off mechanism also renders UTSA&#8208;280 superior water/ethanol diffusion selectivity for pervaporation. To validate this unique mechanism, we conducted 1H and 2H solid&#8208;state NMR on UTSA&#8208;280 after the adsorption of deuterated water. We also derived potential energy diagrams from the density functional theory to gain atomic&#8208;level insight into the knock&#8208;off and the direct&#8208;hopping mechanisms. The simulation findings reveal that the energy barrier of the knock&#8208;off mechanism is marginally lower than the direct&#8208;hopping pathway, implying its potential role in enhancing water diffusion in UTSA&#8208;280.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Stabilized Ag1812+ Cluster with Excitation&#8208;Intensity&#8208;Dependent Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag1812+ cluster displays dual emission which can be used to create a ratiometric light intensity meter.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA&#8208;AgNCs) are easily tunable emitters with intriguing photophysical properties. Here, a DNA&#8208;AgNC with dual emission in the red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions is presented. Mass spectrometry data showed that two DNA strands stabilize 18 silver atoms with a nanocluster charge of 12+. Besides determining the composition and charge of DNA2[Ag18]12+, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved methods were applied to characterize the picosecond red fluorescence and the relatively intense microsecond&#8208;lived NIR luminescence. During this process, the luminescence&#8208;to&#8208;fluorescence ratio was found to be excitation&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent. This peculiar feature is very rare for molecular emitters and allows the use of DNA2[Ag18]12+ as a nanoscale excitation intensity probe. For this purpose, calibration curves were constructed using three different approaches based either on steady&#8208;state or time&#8208;resolved emission measurements. The results showed that processes like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or photon upconversion through triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) could be excluded for DNA2[Ag18]12+. We, therefore, speculate that the ratiometric excitation intensity response could be the result of optically activated delayed fluorescence.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of Fluorophores from a &#8220;Flex&#8208;activated&#8221; Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first flex&#8208;activated fluorogenic mechanophore (FA) is presented. Its retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction, resulting in the release of anthracenes with turn&#8208;on fluorescence, is achieved through compression of FA&#8208;crosslinked networks or hydrostatic high pressure applied to FA crystals and its polymers. The structural and functional diversity of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores as sensitive and unconventional optical force probes is enriched.







Abstract
Optical force probes that can release force&#8208;dependent and visualized signals with minimal changes in the polymer main chains under mechanical load are highly sought after but currently limited. In this study, we introduce a flex&#8208;activated mechanophore (FA) based on the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct of anthracene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylatea that exhibits turn&#8208;on mechanofluorescence. We demonstrate that when FA is incorporated into polymer networks or in its crystalline state, it can release fluorescent anthracenes through a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction under compression or hydrostatic high pressure, respectively. The flex&#8208;activated mechanism of FA is successfully confirmed. Furthermore, we systematically modulate the force delivered to the mechanophore by varying the crosslinking density of the networks and the applied macroscopic pressures. This modulation leads to incremental increases in mechanophore activation, successive release of anthracenes, and quantitative enhancement of fluorescence intensity. The exceptional potential of FA as a sensitive force probe in different bulk states is highlighted, benefiting from its unique flex&#8208;activated mode with highly emissive fluorophore releasing. Overall, this report enriches our understanding of the structures and functions of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores and polymeric materials.

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to visualize molecular structures and interactions in a cellulose oligomer assembly. High&#8208;resolution imaging with CO&#8208;modified tips, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers and details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. Comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208; oligomers shows their spontaneous enantioseparation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8220;material of choice&#8221; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three&#8208;dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208;oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.

         <title>Automated Generation of Microkinetics for Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reactions Considering Correlated Uncertainties
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is used to automatically generate an ensemble of mechanisms for the oxidation of emissions over Pt(111). By sampling energetic parameters from the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional, every generated mechanism corresponds to a different DFT functional. From the broad range of predictions, it is possible to identify microkinetic models that achieve remarkable agreement with experiments.







Abstract
The study presents an ab&#8208;initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first&#8208;principles&#8208;based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange&#8208;correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT&#8208;constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.

&lt;p&gt;The Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is used to automatically generate an ensemble of mechanisms for the oxidation of emissions over Pt(111). By sampling energetic parameters from the uncertainty space of the BEEF-vdW functional, every generated mechanism corresponds to a different DFT functional. From the broad range of predictions, it is possible to identify microkinetic models that achieve remarkable agreement with experiments.

&lt;p&gt;The study presents an ab-initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF-vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first-principles-based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange-correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT-constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directing (110) Oriented Lithium Deposition through High&#8208;flux Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling lithium (Li) electrocrystallization with preferred orientation is a promising strategy to realize highly reversible Li metal batteries (LMBs) but lack of facile regulation methods. Herein, we report a high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) strategy to direct (110) preferred Li deposition even on (200)&#8208;orientated Li substrate. Bravais rule and Curie&#8208;Wulff principle are expanded in Li electrocrystallization process to decouple the relationship between SEI engineering and preferred crystal orientation. Multi&#8208;spectroscopic techniques combined with dynamics analysis reveal that the high&#8208;flux CF3Si(CH3)3 (F3) induced SEI (F3&#8208;SEI) with high LiF and &#8208;Si(CH3)3 contents can ingeniously accelerate Li+ transport dynamics and ensure the sufficient Li+ concentration below SEI to direct Li (110) orientation. The induced Li (110) can in turn further promote the surface migration of Li atoms to avoid tip aggregation, resulting in a planar, dendrite&#8208;free morphology of Li. As a result, our F3&#8208;SEI enables ultra&#8208;long stability of Li||Li symmetrical cells for more than 336 days. Furthermore, F3&#8208;SEI modified Li can significantly enhance the cycle life of Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM811 coin and pouch full cells in practical conditions. Our crystallographic strategy for Li dendrite suppression paves a path to achieve reliable LMBs and may provide guidance for the preferred orientation of other metal crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Comparisons between Directing and Alternating Current Electrolysis in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrosynthesis has consistently aroused significant interest within both academic and industrial spheres. Despite the considerable progress achieved in this field, the majority of electrochemical transformations have been conducted through the utilization of direct&#8208;current (DC) electricity. In contrast, the application of alternating current (AC), characterized by its polarity&#8208;alternating nature, remains in its infancy within the sphere of organic synthesis, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive theoretical framework. This minireview offers an overview of recent advancements in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and seeks to elucidate the differences between DC and AC electrolytic methodologies by probing into their underlying physical principles. These differences encompass the ability of AC to preclude the deposition of metal catalysts, the precision in modulating oxidation and reduction intensities, and the mitigation of mass transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Nanohoop Polymers based on Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalenes for Charge Storage in Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With their bent &#960;&#8208;systems, cyclic conjugation and inherent cavities, conjugated nanohoops are attractive for organic electronics applications. For ease of processing and morphological stability, an incorporation into polymers is desirable, but to date was hampered with few exceptions by synthetic difficulties. We herein present a unique strategy for the synthesis of conjugated nanohoop polymers using a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) as central connector. We demonstrate this versatility by synthesizing three electronically diverse copolymers with dithienyldiketo(pyrrolopyrrol), fluorene and carbazole comonomers, and report the first donor&#8208;acceptor nanohoop polymer. Optoelectronic investigations reveal the prevalence of cyclic or linear conjugation, depending on the comonomer unit, and ambipolar electrochemical properties through the antiaromatic character of the DBP units. As the first report on using conjugated nanohoops for charge storage as positive electrode materials, we show a significant improvement in battery performance in a nanohoop&#8208;containing polymer compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer. We believe this study will pave the way for the synthesis of a diverse range of nanohoop polymers and further stimulate their exploration for charge storage in batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence via Integrated Top&#8208;Down and Bottom&#8208;Up Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the dynamic domain of chiroptical technologies, it is imperative to engineer emitters endowed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. This research demonstrates an advancement by employing a combined top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up strategy for the simultaneous amplification of photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum). Square&#8208;planar Pt(II) complexes form helical assemblies, driven by torsional strain induced by bis(nonyl) chains. Integration of chiral anions leads these assemblies to prefer distinct helical sense. This arrangement activates the metal&#8722;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transition that is CPL&#8208;active, with &#934; and |glum| observing an upswing contingent on the charge number and aryl substituents in chiral anions. Utilizing the soft&#8208;lithographic micromolding in capillaries technique, we could fabricate exquisitely&#8208;ordered, one&#8208;dimensional co&#8208;assemblies to achieve the metrics to &#934; of 0.32 and |glum| of 0.13. Finally, our spectroscopic research elucidates the underlying mechanism for the dual amplification, making a significant stride in the advancement of CPL&#8208;active emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Advantages of Defluorinative C&#8211;F Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Much progress has been made in the development of methods to both create compounds that contain C&#8211;F bonds and to functionalize C&#8211;F bonds. As such, C&#8211;F bonds are becoming common and versatile synthetic functional handles. This review summarizes the advantages of defluorinative functionalization reactions for small molecule synthesis. The coverage is organized by the type of carbon framework the fluorine is attached to for mono&#8208; and polyfluorinated motifs. The main challenges, opportunities and advancements of defluorinative functionalization is discussed for each class of organofluorine. Most of the text focuses on case studies that illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can improve routes to synthetic targets or how the properties of C&#8211;F bonds enable unique mechanisms and reactions. The broader goal is to showcase the opportunities for incorporating and exploiting C&#8211;F bonds in the design of synthetic routes, improvement of specific reactions and advent of new methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Vesicles Enable Mechano&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels are intriguing biomimetic materials. Previous efforts to develop mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels have mostly relied on chemical modifications of the hydrogel structures. Here, we present a simple, generalizable strategy that confers mechano&#8208;responsive behavior on hydrogels. Our approach involves embedding hybrid vesicles, composed of phospholipids and amphiphilic block copolymers, within the hydrogel matrix to act as signal transducers. Under mechanical stress, these vesicles undergo deformation and rupture, releasing encapsulated compounds that can control the hydrogel network. To demonstrate this concept, we embedded vesicles containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, into a calcium&#8208;crosslinked alginate hydrogel. When compressed, the released EGTA sequesters calcium ions and degrades the hydrogel. This study provides a novel method for engineering mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels that may be useful in various biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C60/[10]CPP&#8208;Catenanes by Regioselective, Nanocapsule&#8208;Templated Bingel Bis&#8208;Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of two unsymmetric malonate esters to the Buckminster fullerene C60 can lead to 22 spectroscopically distinguishable isomeric products and therefore represents a formidable synthesis challenge. In this work, we achieve 87% selectivity for the formation of a single (in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3) isomer by combining three approaches: (i) we use a starting material, in which the two malonates are covalently connected (tether approach); (ii) we form the strong supramolecular complex of C60 with the shape&#8208;persistent [10]CPP macrocycle (template approach) and (iii) we embed this complex further within a self&#8208;assembled nanocapsule (shadow mask approach). Variation of the spacer chain shed light on the limitations of the approach and the ring dynamics in the unusual [2]catenanes were studied in silico with atomistic resolution. This work significantly widens the scope of mechanically interlocked architectures comprising cycloparaphenylenes (CPP).</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Resolved Organic Whispering&#8208;Gallery&#8208;Mode Hetero&#8208;Microrings for High&#8208;Security Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. However, such kind of barcodes developed hitherto are primarily based on microcavities wherein multiple gain medias were blended into a single matrix, thus resulting in the limited and indistinguishable coding elements. Here, a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy is proposed to construct the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple spatial colors along its circular direction. Through precisely regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strength, full&#8208;color microrings covering the entire visible range were effectively acquired, which exhibit a series of sharp and recognizable peaks and allow for the effective construction of high&#8208;quality photonic barcodes. Notably, the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple coding elements were finally acquired through heterogeneous nucleation and growth controlled by the directional diffusion between the hetero&#8208;emulsion droplets, thus remarkably promoting the security strength and coding capacity of the barcodes. The results would be useful to fabricate new types of organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Near&#8208;Neutral Electrolyte Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performance of electrocatalytic reactions depends on not only the composition and structure of the active sites, but also their local environment, including the surrounding electrolyte. In this work, we demonstrate that BF2(OH)2&#8208; anion is the key fluoroborate species formed in the mixed KBi/KF (KBi = potassium borate) electrolyte to enhance the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH. Through a combination of electrokinetic and in&#8208;situ spectroscopic studies, we show that the mixed KBi/KF electrolyte promotes the OER via two pathways: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH during the proton&#8208;producing reaction with its high buffering capacity; and 2) activating the interfacial water via strong hydrogen bonds with F&#8208;containing species. With the KBi/KF electrolyte, electrodeposited Co(OH)2 is able to achieve 100 mA/cm2 at 1.74 V, which is among the highest reported activities with earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts at near neutral conditions. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging electrolyte&#8208;engineering for improving the electrochemical performance of the OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferricyanide Armed Anodes Enable Stable Water Oxidation in Saturated Saline Water at 2 A/cm2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct seawater electrolysis at high current density and low overpotential affords an effective strategy toward clean and renewable hydrogen fuel production. However, the severe corrosion of anode as a result of the saturation of Cl&#8208; upon continuous seawater feeding seriously hamper the electrolytic process. Herein, cobalt ferricyanide / cobalt phosphide (CoFePBA/Co2P) anodes with Cap/Pin structure are synthesized, which stably catalyze alkaline saturated saline water oxidation at 200&#8208;2000 mA cm&#8208;2 over hundreds of hours without corrosion. Together with the experimental findings, the molecular dynamics simulations reveal that PO43&#8208; and Fe(CN)63&#8208; generated by the electrode play synergistic role in repelling Cl&#8208; via electrostatic repulsion and dense coverage, which reduced Cl&#8208; adsorption by nearly 5&#8208;fold. The novel anionic synergy endow superior corrosion protection for the electrode, and is expected to promote the practical application of saline water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Zn Anode Utilization by Trace Iodine Ions in Organic&#8208;Water Hybrid Electrolytes through Formation of Anion&#8208;rich Adsorbing Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of elevated de&#8208;solvation barrier caused by the addition of organic co&#8208;solvent to reduce H2O activity is solved via adding a trace amount of I&#8722; into the electrolyte. An I&#8722; ion&#8208;rich adsorbing layer is formed on the surface of Zn anode which promotes Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation and induces uniform Zn plating. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell achieves 10500&#8197;h lifetime and Zn//VS2@SS full cell cycles 170&#8197;cycles with a high Zn utilization of 27&#8201;%.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H2O&#8208;induced Zn&#8208;corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H2O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50&#8197;mM iodine ions into an organic&#8208;water (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME)+water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H2O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond network and exclude H2O from Zn2+ solvation shell. And the I&#8722; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation barrier from 74.33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to 32.26&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5&#8197;months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5&#8201;%). In particular, the Zn//VS2@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170&#8197;cycles at a low N&#8201;:&#8201;P ratio (3.64). Even with the cathode mass&#8208;loading of 16.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the full cell maintains the areal capacity of 0.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 1600&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Breaking Local Charge Symmetry of Iron Single Atoms for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed iron atoms coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon nanocage substrates for NO3&#8722;RR was designed. The tuning of P increases the electron density of the Fe center, which promotes the adsorption and proton transfer of nitrate ions and related intermediates on the surface of electrocatalyst, leading to the superior NO3&#8722;RR performance at low overpotentials.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of nitrate pollutants into value&#8208;added ammonia is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the development of electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) has been hampered by high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency. Here we develop an iron single&#8208;atom catalyst coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C) as a NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalyst. Owing to the tuning effect of phosphorus atoms on breaking local charge symmetry of the single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom catalyst, it facilitates the adsorption of nitrate ions and enrichment of some key reaction intermediates during the NO3&#8722;RR process. The Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C catalyst exhibits 90.3&#8201;% ammonia Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 17980&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, operando SR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy measurements reveal the reaction pathway based on key intermediates observed under different applied potentials and reaction durations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the optimized free energy of NO3&#8722;RR intermediates is ascribed to the asymmetric atomic interface configuration, which achieves the optimal electron density distribution. This work demonstrates the critical role of atomic&#8208;level precision modulation by heteroatom doping for the NO3&#8722;RR, providing an effective strategy for improving the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts in different electrochemical reactions.

         <title>When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transmetallation of a transition metal metallocene &#8220;like&#8221; compound is reported for the first time. While the parent ferrocene analogue Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) is inert to this reactivity its imidazolium and NHC functionalized derivatives undergo rapid transmetallation to Ir and Cu.







Abstract
Ferrocene 1 and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue 2 are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetallation chemistry of the Fe&#8208;center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species 3&#8201;Fe and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that 3&#8201;Fe can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 that also displays unique reactivity. When 5 is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 it also undergoes a rapid transmetallation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford 6 but with the added twist that the Li&#8208;carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when 6 is subsequently treated with CuCl, the Li&#8208;carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li&#8208;carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster 8. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.

         <title>Atroposelective PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis for the Isoquinoline&#8208;Forming Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective formation of isoquinoline heterocycles by a PIII/PV=O redox organocatalyzed Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction is described. With N2 release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, the method permits the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomeric isoquinolines under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. and 93&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the feasibility of atroposelective PIII/PV=O redox organocatalysis by the Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction. The formation of isoquinoline heterocycles thereby enables the synthesis of a broad range of valuable atropisomers under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. Readily prepared azido cinnamate substrates convert in high yield with stereocontrol by a chiral phosphine catalyst, which is regenerated using a silane reductant under Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis. The reaction provides access to diversified aryl isoquinolines, as well as benzoisoquinoline and naphthyridine atropisomers. The products are expeditiously transformed into N&#8208;oxides, naphthol and triaryl phosphine variants of prevalent catalysts and ligands. With dinitrogen release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, it is anticipated that atroposelective redox organocatalysis provides access to a multitude of aromatic heterocycles with precise control over their configuration.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Additive&#8208;Induced Interphases Enable Highly Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrahigh S&#8208;content additive, methylene methyl disulfonate, is preferentially oxidized via the strong interaction with PF6&#8722; anions, which forms the sulfur&#8208;rich interphase and broadens the oxidation stability of electrolyte. Thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced electrochemical performance of high&#8208;voltage 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite pouch cells.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their promising high energy density. However, severe capacity degradation is witnessed, which originated from the incompatible and unstable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase at high voltage. Herein, a robust additive&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;rich interphase is constructed by introducing an additive with ultrahigh S&#8208;content (34.04&#8201;%, methylene methyl disulfonate, MMDS) in 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)||graphite pouch cell. The MMDS does not directly participate the inner Li+ sheath, but the strong interactions between MMDS and PF6&#8722; anions promote the preferential decomposition of MMDS and broaden the oxidation stability, facilitating the formation of an ultrathin but robust sulfur&#8208;rich interfacial layer. The electrolyte consumption, gas production, phase transformation and dissolution of transition metal ions were effectively inhibited. As expected, the 4.6&#8197;V NCM523||graphite pouch cell delivers a high capacity retention of 87.99&#8201;% even after 800&#8197;cycles. This work shares new insight into the sulfur&#8208;rich additive&#8208;induced electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase for stable high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>Crossover Sorption of C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4 in Soft Porous Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible coordination networks exhibit crossover sorption with change in affinity and uptake capacity on varying the temperature. The coordination networks show reverse affinity and uptake capacity for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4. This phenomenon was verified by both sorption isotherm and isobar measurements at different temperature ranges. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations were used to elucidate the mechanisms.







Abstract
Porous sorbents are materials that are used for various applications, including storage and separation. Typically, the uptake of a single gas by a sorbent decreases with temperature, but the relative affinity for two similar gases does not change. However, in this study, we report a rare example of &#8220;crossover sorption,&#8221; in which the uptake capacity and apparent affinity for two similar gases reverse at different temperatures. We synthesized two soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs), [Zn2(L1)(L2)2]n (PCP&#8208;1) and [Zn2(L1)(L3)2]n (PCP&#8208;2) (L1= 1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene, L2=5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene, and L3=5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene). These PCPs exhibits structural changes upon gas sorption and show the crossover sorption for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4, in which the apparent affinity reverse with temperature. We used in situ gas&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis to reveal the guest inclusion structures of PCP&#8208;1 for C2H2, CO2, C2H6, and C2H4 gases at various temperatures. Interestingly, we observed three&#8208;step single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (sc&#8208;sc) transformations with the different loading phases under these gases, providing insight into guest binding positions, nature of host&#8211;guest or guest&#8208;guest interactions, and their phase transformations upon exposure to these gases. Combining with theoretical investigation, we have fully elucidated the crossover sorption in the flexible coordination networks, which involves a reversal of apparent affinity and uptake of similar gases at different temperatures. We discovered that this behaviour can be explained by the delicate balance between guest binding and host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Controlled CdS/Ti3C2 MXene Schottky Junction for Highly Selective and Active Photocatalytic Dehydrogenation&#8208;Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction, synthesized by crystal orientation control and heterostructure construction, shows unprecedented selectivity, activity, and stability for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination under ambient conditions. Using the presented protocol, a wide range of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxyl acids can be successfully converted into the corresponding amino acids.







Abstract
Photocatalytic valorization and selective transformation of biomass&#8208;derived platform compounds offer great opportunities for efficient utilization of renewable resources under mild conditions. Here, the novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction (MCdS) composed of surface&#8208;controlled CdS and pretreated Ti3C2 MXene is created for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived amino acid production under ambient temperature with unprecedented activity and selectivity. Schottky junction efficiently promotes photoexcited charge migration and separation and inhibits photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination, which results in a super&#8208;high activity. Meanwhile, CdS with the reduced surface energy supplies sufficient hydrogen sources for imine reduction and induces the preferential orientation of alanine, thus contributing superior selectivity. Moreover, a wide range of hydroxyl acids are successfully converted into corresponding amino acids and even one&#8208;pot conversion of glucose to alanine is easily achieved over MCdS. This work illustrates the mechanism of crystal orientation control and heterojunction construction in controlling catalytic behavior of photocatalytic nanoreactor, providing a paradigm for construction of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides by Using Ball Milling and a Piezoelectric Material as the Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. A new protocol, starting from aryldiazonium salts, that uses ball milling and piezoelectric materials as redox catalysts is described. This process addresses the limitations of the Balz&#8211;Schiemann procedure, which is currently used in industry. In addition, the mechanism of this fluorination reaction is also investigated.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8211;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine and a terminal reductant.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Stereoselective Glycosylation via RhII and Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Cocatalyzed Carbenoid Insertion to the Anomeric OH Bond for the Synthesis of Glycoconjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates was reported via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion, achieving excellent anomeric/diastereo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of glycoconjugates is essential for studying the biological functions of carbohydrates. We herein report an efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of challenging &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion to the anomeric OH bond. Notably, we observed excellent anomeric selectivity, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency for this glycosylation reaction by exploring various parameters of the cocatalytic system.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical synthesis of glycoconjugates is essential for studying the biological functions of carbohydrates. We herein report an efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of challenging &#945;-linked glycoconjugates via a Rh&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)-cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation of sugar-derived lactols via carbenoid insertion to the anomeric OH bond. Notably, we observed excellent anomeric selectivity, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency for this glycosylation reaction by exploring various parameters of the cocatalytic system. DFT calculations suggested that the anomeric selectivity was mainly determined by steric interactions between the C2-carbon of the carbohydrate and the phenyl group of the metal carbenoid, while &#960;/&#960; interactions with the C2&#8722;OBn substituent on the carbohydrate substrate play a significant role for diastereoselectivity at the newly generated stereogenic center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by Unstabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles is described. Synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products were smoothly transformed into highly substituted pyridines. The method tolerates a range of electrophiles and proceeds under an atmospheric pressure of CO.







Abstract
This report describes the first example of palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles. The approach involves initiation by an unstabilized enolate nucleophile under an atmospheric pressure of CO and termination with a carbon electrophile. This process is compatible with a diverse range of electrophiles, including aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl iodides to yield synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products, which were demonstrated to be precursors for multi&#8208;substituted pyridines. A PdI&#8208;dimer complex with two bridging CO units was observed although its role in catalysis is not yet understood.

         <title>An In Situ Investigation of the Protein Corona Formation Kinetics of Single Nanomedicine Carriers by Self&#8208;Regulated Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy is designed to investigate protein corona formation kinetics of single nanomedicine carriers in situ. The nanoparticles with negative charges spontaneously enhance their local ECL intensity, and the enhancement degree is influenced by the formed protein corona. With the high spatiotemporal resolution of ECL microscopy, the protein corona formation process is monitored in situ and information of protein corona formation kinetics is obtained.







Abstract
Protein coronas are present extensively at the bio&#8208;nano interface due to the natural adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials in biological fluids. Aside from the robust property of nanoparticles, the dynamics of the protein corona shell largely define their chemical identity by altering interface properties. However, the soft coronas are normally complex and rapidly changing. To real&#8208;time monitor the entire formation, we report here a self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the interaction of the Ru(bpy)33+ with the nanoparticle surface. Thus, the heterogeneity of the protein corona is in situ observed in single nanoparticle &#8220;cores&#8221; before and after loading drugs in nanomedicine carriers. The label&#8208;free, optical stable and dynamic ECL microscopy minimize misinterpretations caused by the variation of nanoparticle size and polydispersity. Accordingly, the synergetic actions of proteins and nanoparticles properties are uncovered by chemically engineered protein corona. After comparing the protein corona formation kinetics in different complex systems and different nanomedicine carriers, the universality and accuracy of this technique were well demonstrated via the protein corona formation kinetics curves regulated by competitive adsorption of Ru(bpy)33+ and multiple proteins on surface of various carriers. The work is of great significance for studying bio&#8208;nano interface in drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment.

         <title>Managing Excess Lead Iodide with Functionalized Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanosheets for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effectively managing excess lead iodide is crucial for enhancing perovskite stability. An innovative approach, tailoring functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets, stabilizes the perovskite structure and improves charge extraction. This leads to a significant boost in power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells, providing a novel perspective on stabilizing photovoltaic devices.







Abstract
Stability issues could prevent lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from commercialization despite it having a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long&#8208;term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets (Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7&#8201;% in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) PSCs. The devices retain 93.8&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;loss Optical Waveguides through Balancing Deep&#8208;Blue TADF and Orange Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Hybrid Antimony Halide Microstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new group of hybrid antimony halide microstructures are fabricated through a rapid liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, which exhibit ultralow&#8208;loss 1D and 2D optical waveguides through balancing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and orange room temperature phosphorescence (RTP).







Abstract
Harnessing the potential of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is crucial for developing light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, sensors, and many others. However, effective strategies in this domain are still relatively scarce. This study presents a new approach to achieving highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF (with a PLQY of 25&#8201;%) and low&#8208;energy orange RTP (with a PLQY of 90&#8201;%) through the fabrication of lead&#8208;free hybrid halides. This new class of monomeric and dimeric 0D antimony halides can be facilely synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up solution process, requiring only a few seconds to minutes, which offer exceptional stability and nontoxicity. By leveraging the highly adaptable molecular arrangement and crystal packing modes, the hybrid antimony halides demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into regular 1D microrod and 2D microplate morphologies. This self&#8208;assembly is facilitated by multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the inorganic cores and organic shells. Notably, these microstructures exhibit outstanding polarized luminescence and function as low&#8208;dimensional optical waveguides with remarkably low optical&#8208;loss coefficients. Therefore, this work not only presents a pioneering demonstration of deep&#8208;blue TADF in hybrid antimony halides, but also introduces 1D and 2D micro/nanostructures that hold promising potential for applications in white LEDs and low&#8208;dimensional photonic systems.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Amides by a Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Wolff Rearrangement
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral amides was achieved by an asymmetric Wolff rearrangement. A bifunctional phosphoric acid catalyst not only expedited the transformation but also controlled the enantioselectivity. The developed method enables the asymmetric addition between potent nucleophilic reagents and ketene species and provides a new approach to chiral amides.







Abstract
The enantioselective addition of potent nucleophiles to ketenes poses challenges due to competing background reactions and poor stereocontrol. Herein, we present a method for enantioselective phosphoric acid catalyzed amination of ketenes generated from &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones. Upon exposure to visible light, the diazoketones undergo Wolff rearrangement to generate ketenes. The phosphoric acid not only accelerates ketene capture by amines to form a single configuration of aminoenol intermediates but also promotes an enantioselective proton&#8208;transfer reaction of the intermediates to yield the products.

     alt="Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Amides by a Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Wolff Rearrangement**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral amides was achieved by an asymmetric Wolff rearrangement. A bifunctional phosphoric acid catalyst not only expedited the transformation but also controlled the enantioselectivity. The developed method enables the asymmetric addition between potent nucleophilic reagents and ketene species and provides a new approach to chiral amides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enantioselective addition of potent nucleophiles to ketenes poses challenges due to competing background reactions and poor stereocontrol. Herein, we present a method for enantioselective phosphoric acid catalyzed amination of ketenes generated from &#945;-aryl-&#945;-diazoketones. Upon exposure to visible light, the diazoketones undergo Wolff rearrangement to generate ketenes. The phosphoric acid not only accelerates ketene capture by amines to form a single configuration of aminoenol intermediates but also promotes an enantioselective proton-transfer reaction of the intermediates to yield the products. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway and explained how the catalyst expedited the transformation and controlled the enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Compatible Core&#8208;Shell Nanoreactor for in Situ H2&#8208;Driven NAD(P)H Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell nanoreactor was constructed for the manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis. The nanoreactor enabled not only the efficient H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration via the activated hydrogen species relay between metal nanoparticle and metal complex but also the compatibility of the metal catalysts and enzyme for chemoenzymatic cascade reduction.







Abstract
The regeneration of the reduced form cofactor NAD(P)H is essential for the extra&#8208;cellular application of bio&#8208;reduction, which necessitates not only the development of efficient artificial NAD(P)H regeneration catalytic system but also its well compatibility with the cascade enzymatic reduction system. In this work, we reported the preparation of a metal nanoparticle (NP) and metal complex integrated core&#8208;shell nanoreactor for H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration through the immobilization of a Rh complex on Ni/TiO2 surface via a bipyridine contained 3D porous organic polymer (POP). In comparison with the corresponding single component metal NPs and the immobilized Rh complex, the integrated catalyst presented simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity in NAD(P)H regeneration thanks to the rapid spillover of activated H species from metal NPs to Rh complex. In addition, the size&#8208;sieving effect of POP precluded the direct interaction of enzyme and Rh complex confined in the pores, enabling the success coupling of core&#8208;shell nanoreactor and aldehyde ketone reductase (AKR) for chemoenzymatic reduction of acetophenone to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol. This work provides a strategy for the rational manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Driven, Switchable Catalysis Based on Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent regulatory systems of enzymes are widely used to modulate biological enzyme activities. Inspired by the regulation of reactive&#8208;site phosphorylation in organisms, we developed peptide&#8208;based catecholase mimetics with switchable catalytic activity and high selectivity through the co&#8208;assembly of nanofibers comprising peptides and copper ions (Cu2+). Through careful design and modification of the peptide backbone structure based on the change in the free energy of the system, we identified the peptide with the most effective reversible catalytic activity. Kinase/phosphatase switches were used to control the reversible transition of nanofiber formation and depolymerization, as well as to modulate the active&#8208;site microenvironment. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly processes of nanofibers were simulated using coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirmed the coordination of the peptide and Cu2+, forming a zipper&#8208;like four&#8208;ligand structure at the catalytically active center of the nanofibers. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic mechanism. This study opens novel avenues for designing biomimetic enzymes with ordered structures and dynamic catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nanoreactor Provides a Comprehensive View of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Cancer&#8208;drug Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to control enzyme cascades entrapped in a nanoporous electrode material (the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221;, e&#8208;Leaf) has been exploited to gain detailed kinetic insight into the mechanism of an anti&#8208;cancer drug. Ivosidenib, used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, acts on a common cancer&#8208;linked variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1 R132H) inhibiting its &#8220;gain&#8208;of&#8208;function&#8221; activity&#8212;the undesired reduction of 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) to the oncometabolite 2&#8208;hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The e&#8208;Leaf quantifies the kinetics of IDH1 R132H inhibition across a wide and continuous range of conditions, efficiently revealing factors underlying the inhibitor residence time. Selective inhibition of IDH1 R132H by Ivosidenib and another inhibitor, Novartis 224, is readily resolved as a two&#8208;stage process whereby initial rapid non&#8208;inhibitory binding is followed by a slower step to give the inhibitory complex. These kinetic features are likely present in other allosteric inhibitors of IDH1/2. Such details, essential for understanding inhibition mechanisms, are not readily resolved in conventional steady&#8208;state kinetics or by techniques that rely only on measuring binding. Extending the new method and analytical framework presented here to other enzyme systems will be straightforward and should rapidly reveal insight that is difficult or often impossible to obtain using other methods.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;based solid luminescent materials with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) remain unexplored. Herein, we introduced a family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores featuring distinctive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) selectivity between competitive HBAs in a single molecule. Our investigations showed that the central hydroxyl group preferentially forms intramolecular H&#8208;bonds with imines in imine&#8208;modified 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzothiazole (HBT) chromophores but tethers the benzothiazole moiety in hydrazone&#8208;modified HBT chromophores. Imine&#8208;derived HBTs generally exhibit higher fluorescence efficiency, while hydrazone&#8208;derived HBTs show a reduced overlap between the absorption and fluorescence bands. Quantum chemical calculations unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and their impact on the ESIPT process.

         <title>Enhanced Active Sites and Stability in Nano&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical Energy Storage through Dual Regulation by Tannic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited active sites and poor acid&#8208;alkaline solution stability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), significantly limit their wider application. In this study, the acid property of tannic acid (TA) was used as an etchant to etch the surface&#8208;active sites. Subsequently, the further chelation of the protonated TA with the exposed metal active site can effectively protect the metal ions. Meanwhile, the TA provided a large amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can greatly improve the stability of imidazolate&#8208;coordinated MOFs. The electrochemical test results indicated that the MOFs composite materials synthesized using this scheme had high specific capacitance and stability. And the mechanism of its electrochemical reaction process was explored through in&#8208;situ XRD and theoretical calculations. In addition, the same treatment was carried out through a series of carboxyl&#8208;coordinated MOFs, which further confirmed the principle of this scheme to obtain a higher active site and stability. This paper explains the mechanism of functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs by polyphenolic compounds, providing new ideas for the research of nano&#8208;MOFs.</dc:description>

In addition, the same treatment was carried out through a series of carboxyl-coordinated MOFs, which further confirmed the principle of this scheme to obtain a higher active site and stability. This paper explains the mechanism of functionalization of nano-MOFs by polyphenolic compounds, providing new ideas for the research of nano-MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure elucidation of the first sex&#8208;inducing pheromone of a diatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diatoms are abundant unicellular microalgae, responsible for ~ 20% of global photosynthetic CO2 fixation. Nevertheless, we know little about fundamental aspects of their biology, such as their sexual reproduction. Pheromone&#8208;mediated chemical communication is crucial for successful mating. An attraction pheromone was identified in the diatom Seminavis robusta, but metabolites priming cells for sex and synchronizing search and mating behavior remained elusive. These sex&#8208;inducing pheromones (SIP) induce cell cycle arrest and trigger the production of the attraction pheromone. Here we describe the challenging structure elucidation of an S. robusta SIP. Guided by metabolomics, a candidate metabolite was identified and elucidated by labeling experiments, NMR, ESI MSn analyses, and chemical transformations. Essential was the use of negative ion mode MS to decipher the unprecedented hydroxyproline and &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing cyclic heptapeptide that acts in femtomolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of a High&#8208;Spin Aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triangulenes are open&#8208;shell triangular graphene flakes with
total spin increasing with their size. In the last years, onsurface&#8208;
synthesis strategies have permitted fabricating and
engineering triangulenes of various sizes and structures with
atomic precision. However, direct proof of the increasing total
spin with their size remains elusive. In this work, we report
the combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis of a
large nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene) and
the detection of its high spin ground state on a Au(111)
surface. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy images
uncovered radical states distributed along the zigzag
edges, which were detected as weak zero&#8208;bias resonances in
scanning tunneling spectra. These spectral features reveal
the partial Kondo screening of a high spin state. Through
a combination of several simulation tools, we find that the
observed distribution of radical states is explained by a quintet
ground state (S = 2), instead of the expected quartet
state (S = 3/2), confirming the positively charged state of
the molecule on the surface.We further provide a qualitative
description of the change of (anti)aromaticity introduced by
N&#8208;substitution, and its role in the charge stabilization on a
surface, resulting in a S = 2 aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene on Au(111).</dc:description>

         <title>Environment&#8208;Responsive Peptide Dimers Bind and Stabilize Double&#8208;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;stranded RNAs (dsRNA) possess immense potential for biomedical applications. However, their therapeutic utility is limited by low stability and poor cellular uptake. Different strategies have been explored to enhance the stability of dsRNA, including the incorporation of modified nucleotides, and the use of diverse carrier systems. Nevertheless, these have not resulted in a broadly applicable approach thereby preventing the wide&#8208;spread application of dsRNA for therapeutic purposes. Herein, we report the design of dimeric stapled peptides based on the RNA&#8208;binding protein TAV2b. These dimers are obtained via disulfide formation and mimic the natural TAV2b assembly. They bind and stabilize dsRNA in the presence of serum, protecting it from degradation. In addition, peptide binding also promotes cellular uptake of dsRNA. Importantly, peptide dimers monomerize under reducing conditions which results in a loss of RNA binding. These findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;based RNA binders for the stabilization and protection of dsRNA, representing an appealing strategy towards the environment&#8208;triggered release of RNA. This can broaden the applicability of dsRNA, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting the use of (decarboxylative) S&#8208;alkylation reaction to produce self&#8208;blowing, recyclable polycarbonate foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric foams are widely used in many industrial applications due to their light weight and superior thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Currently, increasing research efforts is being directed towards the development of greener foam formulations that circumvent the use of isocyanates/blowing agents that are commonly used in the production of foam materials. Here, a straightforward, one&#8208;pot method is presented to prepare self&#8208;blown polycarbonate (PC) foams by exploiting the (decarboxylative) S&#8208;alkylation reaction for in&#8208;situ generation of the blowing agent (CO2). The concomitant formation of a reactive alcohol intermediate promotes a cascade ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonates to yield a cross&#8208;linked polymer network. It is shown that these hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized polycarbonate&#8208;based foams can be easily recycled into films through thermal compression molding. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that complete hydrolytic degradation of the foams is possible, thus offering the potential for zero&#8208;waste materials. This straightforward and versatile process broadens the scope of isocyanate&#8208;free, self&#8208;foaming materials, opening a new pathway for next&#8208;generation environmentally friendly foams.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Emulsions Stabilized by a Multi&#8208;headgroup Surfactant Tolerant to High Concentrations of Acids and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Retaining emulsions stable at high acidity and salinity is still a great challenge. Here, we report a novel multi&#8208;headgroup surfactant (C3H7&#8208;NH+(C10COOH)2, di&#8208;UAPAc) which can be reversibly transformed between cationic, anionic and zwitterionic forms upon pH variation. Stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion (OID) emulsions in strong acid (pH = 2) can be co&#8208;stabilized by low concentrations of di&#8208;UAPAc and silica nanoparticles. High salinity at pH = 2 improves the adsorption of di&#8208;UAPAc on silica particles through hydrogen bonding, resulting in the transformation of OID emulsions into Pickering emulsions. Moreover, emulsification/demulsification and interconversion between OID and Pickering emulsions together with control of the viscosity and droplet size can be triggered by pH. The present work provides a new protocol for designing surfactants for various applications in harsh aqueous media, such as strong acidity and high salinity, involved in oil recovery and sewerage treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Allenylation of Alkynes mediated by Chiral Organoselenated Reagents under Oxidative Conditions.</title>

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Biocatalysis by Unspecific Peroxygenases with Genetically Encoded Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have gained substantial attention for their versatile oxyfunctionalization chemistry paired with impressive catalytic capabilities. A major drawback, however, remains their sensitivity towards their co&#8208;substrate hydrogen peroxide, necessitating the use of smart in situ hydrogen peroxide generation methods to enable efficient catalysis setups. Within this report, we introduce flavin&#8208;containing protein photosensitizers as a new general tool for light&#8208;controlled in situ hydrogen peroxide production. The use of light as an abundant, inexpensive, and switchable induction agent enables efficient spatial control of enzymatic activity. By genetically fusing FbFPs and UPOs, we have created two virtually self&#8208;sufficient photo&#8208;enzymes (PhotUPO), which have been thoroughly characterized. Subsequent testing of a versatile substrate panel with the two divergent PhotUPOs revealed two stereoselective conversions. The catalytic performance of the fusion protein was optimized through enzyme and substrate loading variation, enabling up to 24300 turnover numbers (TONs) for the sulfoxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide. The PhotUPO concept was upscaled to a 100 mg substrate preparative scale, enabling the extraction of enantiopure alcohol products.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Selective Ionic Crosslinking Provides Stretchable Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically compliant conductors are of utmost importance for the emerging fields of soft electronics and robotics. However, the development of intrinsically deformable organic conductors remains a challenge due to the trade&#8208;off between mechanical performance and charge mobility. In this study, we report a solution to this issue based on size&#8208;selective ionic crosslinking. This rationally designed crosslinking mediated by length&#8208;regulated oligo(ethylene glycol) pendant groups and metal ions simultaneously improved the softness and toughness and ensured excellent mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductivity in poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate composite materials. Moreover, the added ions remarkably promoted accumulation of charge carriers in response to temperature gradient, thus offering a viable approach to stretchable thermoelectric generators with enhanced stability against humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Problems of zinc anode including dendrite and hydrogen evolution seriously degrade the performance of zinc batteries. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which plays a key role in achieving high reversibility of lithium anode in aprotic organic solvent, is also beneficial to performance improvement of zinc anode in aqueous electrolyte. However, various studies about interphase for zinc electrode is quite fragmented, and lack of deep understanding on root causes or general design rules for SEI construction. And water molecules with high reactivity brings serious challenge to the effective SEI construction. Here, we reviewed the brief development history of zinc batteries firstly, then summarized the approaches to construct SEI in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms behind approaches are systematically analyzed, together with discussion on the SEI components and evaluation on electrochemical performance of zinc anode with various types of SEI. Meanwhile, the challenge between lab and industrialization are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic Polymeric Sulfur Ylides with Minimal Charge Separation Open a New Generation of Antifouling and Bactericidal Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zwitterionic polymers are widely employed hydrophilic building blocks for antifouling coatings with numerous applications across a wide range of fields, including but not limited to biomedical science, drug delivery and nanotechnology. Zwitterionic polymers are considered as an attractive alternative to polyethylene glycol because of their biocompatibility and effectiveness to prevent&#160;formation of biofilms. To this end, zwitterionic polymers are classified in two categories, namely polybetaines and polyampholytes. Yet, despite a fundamental interest to drive the development of new antifouling materials, the chemical composition of zwitterionic polymer remains severely limited. Here, we show that poly(sulfur ylides) that&#160;belong&#160;to the largely overlooked class of poly(ylides),&#160;effectively prevent the&#160;formation of biofilms from pathogenic bacteria. While surface energy analysis reveals strong hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor capabilities of poly(sulfur ylide), membrane damage of pathogenic bacteria induced by poly(sulfur ylides) indicates toxicity towards bacteria while not affecting eucaryotic cells. Such synergistic effect of poly(sulfur ylides) offers distinct advantages over polyethylene glycol when designing new antifouling materials. We expect that our findings will pave the way for the development of a range of ylide&#8208;based materials with antifouling properties that have yet to be explored, opening up new directions at the interface of chemistry, biology, and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nitro&#8208;Modified Luminescent Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Non&#8208;Contact and High&#8208;Contrast Sensing of Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global demand for intelligent sensing of aromatic amines has consistently increased due to concerns about health and the environment. Efforts to improve material design and understand mechanisms have been made, but highly efficient non&#8208;contact sensing with host&#8211;guest structures remains a challenge. Herein, we report the first example of non&#8208;contact, high&#8208;contrast sensing of aromatic amines in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on a nitro&#8208;modified stereo building block. Direct observation of binding interactions of trapped amines is achieved, leading to charge separation&#8208;induced emission quenching between host and guests. Non&#8208;contact sensing of aniline and diphenylamine is realized with quenching efficiencies up to 91.7% and 97.0%, which shows potential for versatile applications. This work provides an inspiring avenue to engineer multifunctional HOFs via co&#8208;crystal preparations, thus enriching applications of porous materials with explicit mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable Tetragold(0) Clusters with Polarity&#8208;Tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8210;Au Bond via Intramolecular &#963;&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;aromatization is a trait of many organic compounds that enhances the stability of their structures and polarizes related C&#8210;C &#960; bonds. In contrast, rare study is focused on this phenomenon in metal clusters. Many existing homometallic clusters exhibit aromaticity, often characterized by nonpolar metal&#8208;metal bonds and a high degree of symmetry. However, synthesizing low&#8208;symmetric homometallic clusters with high&#8208;polar metal&#8208;metal bonds is challenging due to their limited thermodynamic stability. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of [Au(&#956;2&#8208;ER2)]3&#8210;AuPMe3 (E = Ge, Sn; R2 = 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) clusters and reveal a novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Our electronic structure analyses show that these low&#8208;symmetric clusters possess a ten&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;aromatic system, which is achieved via intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Moreover, the strength of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity gives rise to a polarity&#8208;tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8210;Au bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkages Make a Difference in the Photoluminescence of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural designability and tunability of photophysical properties enable them to be a promising class of organic luminescent materials by incorporating well&#8208;designed fluorescent units directly into the periodic skeletons. The photophysical properties of COFs are mainly affected by the structural parameters, which determine the conjugation degree, charge delocalization ability, and exciton dynamics of COFs. To understand the relationship between COF structures and their photophysical properties, two COFs with the same pyrene chromophore units but different linkages (imine or vinyl) were designed and synthesized. Interestingly, different linkages endow COFs with huge differences in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked pyrene&#8208;based COFs, which possess PLQY values of 0.34% and 15.43%, respectively. The femtosecond&#8208;transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveal the different charge&#8208;transfer pathways in imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked COFs, which influence the exciton relaxation way and fluorescence intensity. In addition, an effective white&#8208;light device was obtained by coating the vinylene&#8208;linked COF on a light&#8208;emitting diode strip.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of Bi&#8208;Functionalized Porphyrins: A Novel Class of Hole&#8208;Layer&#8208;Coordinating Perovskites and Indium Tin Oxide in Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) offer the advantage of facile interfacial modification, leading to significant improvements in device performance. In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a new series of carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized porphyrin derivatives, namely AC&#8208;1, AC&#8208;3, and AC&#8208;5, and present, for the first time, a strategy to exploit the large &#960;&#8208;moiety of porphyrins as a backbone for interfacing the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and perovskite active layer in an inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) configuration. The electron&#8208;rich nature of porphyrins facilitates hole transfer and the formation of SAMs, resulting in a dense surface that minimizes defects. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies demonstrate that the double&#8208;anchored AC&#8208;3 and AC&#8208;5 enhance SAMs on ITO, passivate the perovskite layer, and function as conduits to facilitate hole transfer, thus significantly boosting the performance of PSCs. The champion inverted PSC employing AC&#8208;5 SAM achieves an impressive solar efficiency of 23.19% with a high fill factor of 84.05%. This work presents a novel molecular engineering strategy for functionalizing SAMs to tune the energy levels, molecular dipoles, packing orientations to achieve stable and efficient solar performance. Importantly, our comprehensive investigation has unraveled the associated mechanisms, offering valuable insights for future advancements in PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemodivergent Staudinger Reactions of Secondary Phosphine Oxides and Application to the Total Synthesis of LL&#8208;D05139&#946; Potassium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented Staudinger reaction modes of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) and organic azides are herein disclosed. By the application of various additives, selective nitrogen atom exclusion from the azide group has been achieved. Chlorotrimethylsilane mediates a stereoretentive Staudinger reaction with a 2&#8208;N exclusion which provides a valuable method for the synthesis of phosphinic amides and can be considered complementary to the stereoinvertive Atherton&#8208;Todd reaction. Alternatively, a 1&#8208;N exclusion pathway is promoted by acetic acid to provide the corresponding diazo compound. The effectiveness of this protocol has been further demonstrated by the total synthesis of the diazo&#8208;containing natural product LL&#8208;D05139&#946;, which was prepared as a potassium salt for the first time in 6 steps and 26.5% overall yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial&#160;Deoxygenative CO Homocoupling By a Diiron Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One route to address climate change is converting carbon dioxide to synthetic carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Whereas carbon dioxide to CO conversion has strong precedent in homo&#8208; and heterogeneous catalysis, deoxygenative coupling of CO to products with C&#8211;C bonds&#8212;as in liquid fuels&#8212;remains challenging. Here, we report coupling of two CO molecules by a diiron complex. Reduction of Fe2(CO)2L (2), where L2&#8211; is a bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane, gives [K(THF)5][Fe2(CO)2L] (3), which undergoes silylation to Fe2(CO)(COSiMe3)L (4). Subsequent C&#8211;OSiMe3 bond cleavage and C=C bond formation occurs upon reduction of 4, yielding Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)L. CO derived ligands in this series mediate weak exchange interactions with the ketenylidene affording the smallest J value, with changes to local metal ion spin states and coupling schemes (ferro&#8208; vs. antiferromagnetism) based on DFT calculations, Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy. Finally, reaction of 5 with KEt3BH or methanol releases the C2O2&#8211; ligand with retention of the diiron core.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon absorbing hydrogen, the PdHx in icosahedral nanocrystals exists in one single phase and the single&#8208;phase pathway can bypass the formation of high&#8208;energy phase boundaries involved in the conventional two&#8208;phase pathway. The single&#8208;phase pathway is instrumental to the facile and fast synthesis of PdHx nanocrystals with controllable compositions for different catalytic applications.







Abstract
We report for the first time that Pd nanocrystals can absorb H via a &#8220;single&#8208;phase pathway&#8221; when particles with a proper combination of shape and size are used. Specifically, when Pd icosahedral nanocrystals of 7&#8208; and 12&#8208;nm in size are exposed to H atoms, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide each particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of phase boundaries is no longer favored. As such, absorption of H atoms is dominated by the single&#8208;phase pathway and one can readily obtain PdHx with anyx in the range of 0&#8211;0.7. When switched to Pd octahedral nanocrystals, the single&#8208;phase pathway is only observed for particles of 7&#8197;nm in size. We also establish that the H&#8208;absorption kinetics will be accelerated if there is a tensile strain in the nanocrystals due to the increase in lattice spacing. Besides the unique H&#8208;absorption behaviors, the PdHx (x=0&#8211;0.7) icosahedral nanocrystals show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward the formic acid oxidation due tothe decrease in chemical potential for H atoms in a Pd lattice under tensile strain.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Highly Selective Separation of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel two&#8208;dimensional ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), denoted as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88, is synthesized utilizing the organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine. Once activated, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 demonstrates a notable selectivity for CO2 over C2H2 with an IAST selectivity index of 1894.







Abstract
The separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a very important but challenging task due to their similar molecular dimensions and physical properties. In terms of porous adsorbents for this separation, the CO2&#8208;selective porous materials are superior to the C2H2&#8208;selective ones because of the cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiency but have been rarely achieved. Herein we report our unexpected discovery of the first hydrogen bonded organic framework (HOF) constructed from a simple organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine (PYTPZ) (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88) as the highly CO2&#8208;selective porous material. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 is a two&#8208;dimensional HOFs with a pore pocket of about 7.6&#8197;&#197;. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 takes up a high amount of CO2 (59.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions with the record IAST selectivity of 1894. Its high performance for the CO2/C2H2 separation has been further confirmed through breakthrough experiments, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and molecular simulations.

&lt;p&gt;The novel two-dimensional ultramicroporous hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF), denoted as HOF-FJU-88, is synthesized utilizing the organic linker 2,4,6-tri(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridine. Once activated, HOF-FJU-88 demonstrates a notable selectivity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with an IAST selectivity index of 1894.

         <title>Facile Borylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, Imines, Arenes and Heteroarenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Boranes and a Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we describe a stable semiconductor material, ultrathin CdS nanosheets, can act as a heterogeneous visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst to orchestrate oxidative and reductive interfacial electron transfers for borylation of assorted alkenes, alkynes, imines and aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane. The low&#8208;cost and facile&#8208;prepared CdS catalyst can be recovered and reused for several runs with conserved activity.







Abstract
Although the development of radical chain and photocatalytic borylation reactions using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;borane as boron source is remarkable, the persistent problems, including the use of hazardous and high&#8208;energy radical initiators or the recyclability and photostability issues of soluble homogeneous photocatalysts, still leave great room for further development in a sustainable manner. Herein, we report a conceptually different approach toward highly functionalized organoborane synthesis by using recoverable ultrathin cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanosheets as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, and a general and mild borylation platform that enables regioselective borylation of a wide variety of alkenes (arylethenes, trifluoromethylalkenes, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and nitriles), alkynes, imines and electron&#8208;poor aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane as boryl radical precursor. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both photogenerated electrons and holes on the CdS fully perform their own roles, thereby resulting in enhancement of photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS.

         <title>MIDA&#8208; and TIDA&#8208;Boronates Stabilize &#945;&#8208;Radicals Through B&#8722;N Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows that alkyl MIDA&#8208; and TIDA&#8208;boronates have a notable stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals that arises via B&#8722;N hyperconjugation. This is supported by DFT radical stabilization energy and spin density studies, development of a site&#8208;selective bromination reaction, and LED&#8197;NMR kinetic analysis of bromination rates for different alkyl boronic esters.







Abstract
Multifunctional organoboron compounds increasingly enable the simple generation of complex, Csp3&#8208;rich small molecules. The ability of boron&#8208;containing functional groups to modify the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;radicals has also enabled a myriad of chemical reactions. Boronic esters with vacant p&#8208;orbitals have a significant stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals due to delocalization of spin density into the empty orbital. The effect of coordinatively saturated derivatives, such as N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates and counterparts, remains less clear. Herein, we demonstrate that coordinatively saturated MIDA and TIDA boronates stabilize secondary alkyl &#945;&#8208;radicals via &#963;B&#8208;N hyperconjugation in a manner that allows site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bromination. DFT calculated radical stabilization energies and spin density maps as well as LED&#8197;NMR kinetic analysis of photochemical bromination rates of different boronic esters further these findings. This work clarifies that the &#945;&#8208;radical stabilizing effect of boronic esters does not only proceed via delocalization of radical character into vacant boron p&#8208;orbitals, but that hyperconjugation of tetrahedral boron&#8208;containing functional groups and their ligand electron delocalizing ability also play a critical role. These findings establish boron ligands as a useful dial for tuning reactivity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon.

         <title>Modular Functionalization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Nitrogen Recovery from Fresh Urine
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular functionalized MOF&#8208;808 derivatives were deliberately designed and integrated in a newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process targeting fresh urine. Three distinct modification methods were applied for the development of functional MOFs which deliver efficient nitrogen conversion, recovery, detection, and all contributing to high fresh urine nitrogen recovery that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment.







Abstract
Nitrogen recovery from wastewater represents a sustainable route to recycle reactive nitrogen (Nr). It can reduce the demand of producing Nr from the energy&#8208;extensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process and lower the risk of causing eutrophication simultaneously. In this aspect, source&#8208;separated fresh urine is an ideal source for nitrogen recovery given its ubiquity and high nitrogen contents. However, current techniques for nitrogen recovery from fresh urine require high energy input and are of low efficiencies because the recovery target, urea, is a challenge to separate. In this work, we developed a novel fresh urine nitrogen recovery treatment process based on modular functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, we employed three distinct modification methods to MOF&#8208;808 and developed robust functional materials for urea hydrolysis, ammonium adsorption, and ammonia monitoring. By integrating these functional materials into our newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process, we achieved an average of 75&#8201;% total nitrogen reduction and 45&#8201;% nitrogen recovery with a 30&#8208;minute treatment of synthetic fresh urine. The nitrogen recovery process developed in this work can serve as a sustainable and efficient nutrient management that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment. This work also provides a new perspective of implementing versatile advanced materials for water and wastewater treatment.

         <title>An Encodable Scaffold for Sequence&#8208;Specific Recognition of Duplex RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recognition of nucleic acids by designed ligands has been a long&#8208;term objective due to the biological potential of these ligands. The significant goal of developing small molecule and protein motifs that target duplex DNA has been met but a recognition code for duplex RNA remains in infancy. We show that naturally occurring DNA&#8208;binding helix fork motifs, which do not target equivalent duplex RNA sequences, can be engineered to recognize RNA.







Abstract
RNA, unlike DNA, folds into a multitude of secondary and tertiary structures. This structural diversity has impeded the development of ligands that can sequence&#8208;specifically target this biomolecule. We sought to develop ligands for double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments, which are ubiquitous in RNA tertiary structure. The major groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA is sequence&#8208;specifically recognized by a range of dimeric helical transcription factors, including the basic leucine zippers (bZIP) and basic helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (bHLH) proteins; however, such simple structural motifs are not prevalent in RNA&#8208;binding proteins. We interrogated the high&#8208;resolution structures of DNA and RNA to identify requirements for a helix fork motif to occupy dsRNA major grooves akin to dsDNA. Our analysis suggested that the rigidity and angle of approach of dimeric helices in bZIP/bHLH motifs are not ideal for the binding of dsRNA major grooves. This investigation revealed that the replacement of the leucine zipper motifs in bHLH proteins with synthetic crosslinkers would allow recognition of dsRNA. We show that a model bHLH DNA&#8208;binding motif does not bind dsRNA but can be reengineered as an RNA ligand. Based on this hypothesis, we rationally designed a miniature synthetic crosslinked helix fork (CHF) as a generalizable proteomimetic scaffold for targeting dsRNA. We evaluated several CHF constructs against a set of RNA and DNA hairpins to probe the specificity of the designed construct. Our studies reveal a new class of proteomimetics as an encodable platform for sequence&#8208;specific recognition of dsRNA.

         <dc:description>
Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the surface of Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires are conducive to formation of a Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu adsorption configuration, which facilitates further protonation of a CO* intermediate. The active site promotes CO2 photoreduction to CH4 with improved selectivity to hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Highly selective photoreduction of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons is of great importance to achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Precisely manipulating the formation of the Metal1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal2 (M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2) intermediate on the photocatalyst interface is the most critical step for regulating selectivity, while still a significant challenge. Herein, inspired by the polar electronic structure feature of CO2 molecule, we propose a strategy whereby the Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites confined in a bimetallic catalyst surface are conducive to forming a M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate precisely, which can promote selectivity to hydrocarbon formation. Employing the Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires with abundant Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the preferred exposed {110} surface as a model catalyst, 100&#8201;% selectivity toward photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 has been achieved. Subsequent surface&#8208;quenching experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites do play a vital role in regulating the M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate formation that is considered to be prone to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons. This study reports a highly selective CO2 photocatalyst, which was designed on the basis of a newly proposed theory for precise regulation of reaction intermediates. Our findings will stimulate further research on dual&#8208;site catalyst design for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons.

         <title>Rapid Ozone Decomposition over Water&#8208;activated Monolithic MoO3/Graphdiyne Nanowalls under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sp C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo hybridization in MoO3/GDY facilitates the activation of adsorbed water molecules to hydroxyl species, which act as the new active sites for rapid and efficient ozone decomposition under high humidity for potential practical application.







Abstract
Catalytic ozone (O3) decomposition at high relative humidity (RH) remains a great challenge due to the catalysts poison and deactivation under high humidity. Here, we firstly elaborate the role of water activation and the corresponding mechanism of the promoted O3 decomposition over the three&#8208;dimensional monolithic molybdenum oxide/graphdiyne (MoO3/GDY) catalyst. The O3 decomposition over MoO3/GDY reaches up to 100&#8201;% under high humid condition (75&#8201;% RH) at room temperature, which is 4.0 times as high as that of dry conditions, significantly surpasses other carbon&#8208;based MoO3 materials(&#8804;7.1&#8201;%). The sp&#8208;hybridized carbon in GDY donates electrons to MoO3 along the C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond, facilitating water activation to form hydroxyl species. As a result, hydroxyl species dissociated from water act as new active sites, promoting the adsorption of O3 and the generation of new intermediate species (hydroxyl &#8901;OH and superoxo &#8901;O2&#8722;), which significantly lowers the energy barriers of O3 decomposition (0.57&#8197;eV lower than dry conditions).

         <title>Isoreticular Preparation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Multicomponent Metallacages towards Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent metallacages can integrate the functions of their different building blocks to achieve synergetic effects for advanced applications. Herein, based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we report the preparation of a series of isoreticular tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metallacages, which are well characterized by multinuclear NMR, ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The suitable integration of photosensitizing tetraphenylethylene units as faces and Re catalytic complexes as the pillars into a single metallacage offers a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 1707 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is one of the highest values among reported metallacages. Femtosecond transient absorption and DFT calculations reveal that the metallacage can serve as a platform for the precise and organized arrangement of the two building blocks, enabling efficient and directional electron transfer for highly efficient photocatalytic performance. This study provides a general strategy to integrate multifunctional ligands into a certain metallacage to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which will guide the future design of metallacages towards photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is an emerging field in synthetic chemistry, while its mechanistic studies are challenged by the effective characterization of the elusive intermediate processes. Herein, we develop an operando electrochemical mass spectrometry platform that allows time&#8208;resolved mapping of stepwise electrosynthetic reactive intermediates in both direct current and alternating current modes. By dissecting the key intermediate processes of electrochemical functionalization of arylamines, the unique reactivities of AC electrosynthesis, including minimizing the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction through the inverse process, and enabling effective reaction of short&#8208;lived intermediates generated by oxidation and reduction in paired electrolysis, were evidenced and verified. Notably, the controlled kinetics of reactive N&#8208;centered radical intermediates in multi&#8208;step sequential AC electrosynthesis to minimize the competing reactions was discovered. Overall, this work provides direct evidence for the mechanism of AC electrolysis, and clarifies the underlying reasons for its high efficiency, which will benefit the rational design of AC electrosynthetic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;cost and Non&#8208;flammable Eutectic Electrolytes for Advanced Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost and non&#8208;flammable eutectic electrolytes are reported, which not only cost less than 1/200 of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes, but also show evident universality in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols. Moreover, these eutectic electrolytes greatly expand the range of eutectic electrolytes available for advanced battery design.







Abstract
As a burgeoning electrolyte system, eutectic electrolytes based on ZnCl2/Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2 have been widely proposed in advanced Zn&#8208;I2 batteries; however, safety and cost concerns significantly limit their applications. Here, we report new&#8208;type ZnSO4&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes that are both safe and cost&#8208;effective. Their universality is evident in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols, in which multiple &#8722;OH groups not only involve in Zn2+ solvation but also interact with water, resulting in the high stability of electrolytes. Taking propylene glycol&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolyte as an example, it features significant advantages in non&#8208;flammability and low price that is &lt;1/200 cost of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes. Moreover, its effectiveness in confining the shuttle effects of I2 cathode and side reactions of Zn anodes is evidenced, resulting in Zn&#8208;I2 cells with high reversibility at 1&#8197;C and 91.4&#8201;% capacity remaining under 20&#8197;C. After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, super&#8208;high&#8208;capacity retention of 96.7&#8201;% is achieved after 500&#8197;cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.

&lt;p&gt;As a burgeoning electrolyte system, eutectic electrolytes based on ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been widely proposed in advanced Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries; however, safety and cost concerns significantly limit their applications. Here, we report new-type ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-based eutectic electrolytes that are both safe and cost-effective. Their universality is evident in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols, in which multiple &#8722;OH groups not only involve in Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation but also interact with water, resulting in the high stability of electrolytes. Taking propylene glycol-based hydrated eutectic electrolyte as an example, it features significant advantages in non-flammability and low price that is &amp;lt;1/200 cost of Zn(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based eutectic electrolytes. Moreover, its effectiveness in confining the shuttle effects of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and side reactions of Zn anodes is evidenced, resulting in Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells with high reversibility at 1&#8197;C and 91.4&#8201;% capacity remaining under 20&#8197;C. After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, super-high-capacity retention of 96.7&#8201;% is achieved after 500&#8197;cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Observation of Evolving H2 and Solid Electrolyte Interphase Development at Potassium Insertion Materials within Highly Concentrated Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases (SEI) are key to stable, high voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as a protective barrier that prevents electrolyte decomposition. SEI are thought to play a similar role in highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISE) for emerging aqueous batteries, but their properties remain unknown. In this work, we utilized advanced scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and operando electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) techniques to gain deeper insight into the SEI that occur within highly concentrated WISE. As a model, we focus on a 55 mol/kg K(FSA)0.6(OTf)0.4 electrolyte and a 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide negative electrode. For the first time, our work showed distinctly passivating structures with slow apparent electron transfer rates alike to SEI found in LIBs. In&#8208;situ analyses indicated stable passivating structures when PTCDI was stepped to low potentials (~&#8208;1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl). However, the observed SEI was discontinuous at the surface and H2 evolution occurred as the electrode reached more extreme potentials. OEMS measurements further confirmed a shift in the evolution of detectable H2 from &#8208;0.9 V to &lt;&#8208;1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl when changing from dilute to concentrated electrolytes. In all, our work shows a combined approach of traditional battery measurements with in&#8208;situ analyses for improving characterization of other unknown SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Spiro&#8208;locks into the Nitrogen/Carbonyl System towards Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;blue Multi&#8208;resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current availability of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with excellent color purity and high device efficiency in the deep&#8208;blue region is appealing. To address this issue in the emerged nitrogen/carbonyl MR&#8208;TADF system, we propose a spiro&#8208;lock strategy. By incorporating spiro functionalization into a concise molecular skeleton, a series of emitters (SFQ, SOQ, SSQ, and SSeQ) can enhance molecular rigidity, blue&#8208;shift the emission peak, narrow the emission band, increase the photoluminescence quantum yield by over 92%, and suppress intermolecular interactions in the film state. The referent CZQ without spiro structure has a more planar skeleton, and its bluer emission in the solution state redshifts over 40 nm with serious spectrum broadening and a low PLQY in the film state. As a result, SSQ achieves an external quantum efficiency of 25.5% with a peak at 456 nm and a small full width at half maximum of 31 nm in a simple unsensitized device, significantly outperforming CZQ. This work discloses the importance of spiro&#8208;junction in modulating deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>An Interlocked Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Eight Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here is reported the synthesis and characterization of an interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane molecular shuttle from a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) derivative. This latter bears two molecular chains, whose extremities are able to react together by click chemistry. One of the two substituting chain holds an ammonium function aimed at driving the self&#8208;entanglement through the complexation of the DB24C8 moiety. In the targeted figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane, shuttling of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle from the best ammonium station to the weaker binding site triazolium was performed through deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium. This way, two discrete co&#8208;conformational states were obtained, in which the folding and size of the two loops could be changed.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Magneto&#8208;Optical Cryogenic Thermometers with High Sensitivity: A Magnetic Circular Dichroism Based Thermometric Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Remote temperature probing at the cryogenic range is of utmost importance for the advancement of future quantum technologies. Despite the notable achievements in luminescent thermometers, accurately measuring temperatures below 10 K remains a challenging endeavor. In this study, we propose a novel magneto&#8208;optical thermometric approach based on the magnetic&#8208;circular dichroism (MCD) technique, which offers unprecedented capabilities for meticulous temperature variation analysis at cryogenic temperatures. The inherent temperature sensitivity of the MCD C&#8208;term, in conjunction with both positive and negative signals, enables highly sensitive magneto&#8208;optical temperature probing. Additionally, a groundbreaking relative thermal sensitivity value of 95.3% K&#8208;1 at 2.54 K can be achieved using a mononuclear lanthanide complex, [[Ho(acac)3(phen)], in the presence of a 0.25 T applied magnetic field and using a combination of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple regression. These results unequivocally demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our methodology for cryogenic temperature sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Graphene Nanoribbon Heterojunctions by Chain&#8208;Growth Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. In particular, GNR heterojunctions have received considerable attention due to their exotic topological electronic phases at the heterointerface. However, strategies for their precision synthesis remain at a nascent stage. Here, we report a novel chain&#8208;growth polymerization strategy that allows for constructing GNR heterojunction with N=9 armchair and chevron GNRs segments (9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR). The synthesis involves a controlled Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) between 2&#8208;(6'&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,4''&#8208;ditetradecyl&#8208;[1,1':2',1''&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;3'&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M1) and 2&#8208;(7&#8208;bromo&#8208;9,12&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;tetradecylphenyl)&#8208;triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M2), followed by the Scholl reaction of the obtained block copolymer (poly&#8208;M1/M2) with controlled Mn (18k) and narrow &#272; (1.45). NMR and SEC analysis of poly&#8208;M1/M2 confirm the successful block copolymerization. The solution&#8208;mediated cyclodehydrogenation of poly&#8208;M1/M2 toward 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR is unambiguously validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV&#8722;vis spectroscopies. Moreover, we also demonstrate the on&#8208;surface formation of pristine 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR from the unsubstituted copolymer precursor, which is unambiguously characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Gold and Copper from Electronic Waste by Selective Precipitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recycling of metals from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) using efficient, selective, and sustainable processes is integral to circular economy and net&#8208;zero aspirations. Herein, we report a new method for the selective precipitation of metals such as gold and copper that offsets the use of organic solvents that are traditionally employed in solvent extraction processes. We show that gold can be selectively precipitated from a mixture of metals in hydrochloric acid solution using triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), as the complex [(TPPO)4(O2H5)][AuCl4]. By tuning the acid concentration, controlled precipitation of gold, zinc and iron can be achieved. We also show that copper can be selectively precipitated using 2,3&#8208;pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (2,3&#8208;PDCA), as the complex [Cu(2,3&#8208;PCDA&#8208;H)2]n&#8226;2n(H2O). The combination of these two precipitation methods resulted in the recovery of 99.5% of the Au and 98.5% of the Cu present in the connector pins of an end&#8208;of&#8208;life computer processing unit. The selectivity of these precipitation processes, combined with their straightforward operation and the ability to recycle and reuse the precipitants, suggests potential industrial uses in the purification of gold and copper from e&#8208;waste.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recycling of metals from electronic waste (e-waste) using efficient, selective, and sustainable processes is integral to circular economy and net-zero aspirations. Herein, we report a new method for the selective precipitation of metals such as gold and copper that offsets the use of organic solvents that are traditionally employed in solvent extraction processes. We show that gold can be selectively precipitated from a mixture of metals in hydrochloric acid solution using triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), as the complex [(TPPO)4(O2H5)][AuCl4]. By tuning the acid concentration, controlled precipitation of gold, zinc and iron can be achieved. We also show that copper can be selectively precipitated using 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (2,3-PDCA), as the complex [Cu(2,3-PCDA-H)2]n&#8226;2n(H2O). The combination of these two precipitation methods resulted in the recovery of 99.5% of the Au and 98.5% of the Cu present in the connector pins of an end-of-life computer processing unit. The selectivity of these precipitation processes, combined with their straightforward operation and the ability to recycle and reuse the precipitants, suggests potential industrial uses in the purification of gold and copper from e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A few&#8208;layer fullerene network possesses several advantageous characteristics, including a large surface area, abundant active sites, high charge mobility, and an appropriate bandgap and band edge for solar water splitting. Herein, we report for the first time that the few&#8208;layer fullerene network shows interesting photocatalytic performance in pure water splitting into H2 and H2O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagents. Under optimal conditions, the H2 and H2O2 evolution rates can reach 91 and 116 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively, with good stability. This work demonstrates the novel application of the few&#8208;layer fullerene network in the field of energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes is uncovered, which provides a series of phosphine derivatives in high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The methodology enjoys broad substrate scopes on both 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes and diarylphosphines. The high stereoselectivity is attributed to both the high stability of Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex in the presence of stoichiometric HPPh2 and the produced phosphines and the high&#8208;performance asymmetric induction of the Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex. Finally, the method is used for the synthesis of new chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin compounds built on a cyclopropane skeleton, one of which serves as a wonderful ligand in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of oxygen&#8208;tolerant Photo&#8208;RAFT system for protein&#8208;polymer conjugation achieving high bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;polymer conjugates have significant potential in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. To enable their widespread use, robust conjugation techniques are crucial. This study introduces a photo&#8208;initiated reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (Photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system that exhibits excellent oxygen tolerance. This system allows for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates with high bioactivity under mild and aerobic conditions. Three photocatalytic systems utilizing Eosin Y (EY) as the photocatalyst with two different cocatalysts (ascorbic acid and triethanolamine) were investigated, each generating distinct reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. The impact of these ROS on three model proteins (lysozyme, albumin, and myoglobin) was evaluated, demonstrating varying bioactivities based on the ROS produced. The EY/TEOA system was identified as the optimal photo&#8208;RAFT initiating system, enabling the preparation of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates under aerobic conditions while maintaining high protein enzymatic activity. To showcase the potential of this approach, lysozyme&#8208;poly(dimethylaminoethyl acrylate) conjugates were successfully prepared and exhibited enhanced antimicrobial property against gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized DNA Circuit to Establish an Artificial Interaction between T Cells and Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit with recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules was designed to establish an artificial intercellular interaction mode between T cells and cancer cells. Based on cancer recognition&#8208;induced receptor aggregation, T cells could be directly stimulated to kill target cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Nongenetic strategies that enable control over the cell&#8208;cell interaction network would be highly desired, particularly in T cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. In this work, we developed an aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit to modulate the interaction between T cells and cancer cells. This DNA circuit was composed of recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules. Upon recognizing target cancer cells, the triggering strand was released to induce aggregation of immune receptors on the T cell surface, leading to an enhancement of T cell activity for effective cancer eradication. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this DNA circuit for promoting target cancer cell&#8208;directed stimulation of T cells, which, consequently, enhanced their killing effect on cancer cells. This DNA circuit, as a modular strategy to modulate intercellular interactions, could lead to a new paradigm for the development of nongenetic T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dual&#8208;key&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221; NIR&#8208;II NSCyanine dyes have been developed by harnessing a non&#8208;symmetric strategy, which enable to provide activatable imaging and therapy with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in the liver of extrahepatic diseases, including metastasis&#8208;imaging, acute gastritis&#8208;imaging, bacteria infected wound healing, and tumor ablation via combined photothermal therapy and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Conventional cyanine dyes with a symmetric structure are &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221;, which can easily accumulate in the liver and display high liver background fluorescence, inevitably interfering the accurate diagnosis and therapy in extrahepatic diseases. We herein report a platform of NIR&#8208;II non&#8208;symmetric cyanine (NSCyanine) dyes by harnessing a non&#8208;symmetric strategy, which are extremely sensitive to pH/viscosity and can be activated via a &#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221; strategy. These NSCyanine dyes with a low pKa (&lt;4.0) only show weak fluorescence at lysosome pH (key1), however, the fluorescence can be completely switched on and significantly enhanced by intracellular viscosity (key2) in disease tissues, exhibiting high target&#8208;to&#8208;liver ratios up to 19.5/1. Notably, high&#8208;contrast phototheranostics in extrahepatic diseases are achieved, including intestinal metastasis&#8208;imaging, acute gastritis&#8208;imaging, bacteria infected wound healing, and tumor ablation via targeted combined photothermal therapy and chemotherapy.

         <title>Revision of the Absolute Configurations of Chelocardin and Amidochelocardin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelocardin and its bioengineered derivative, amidochelocardin, are known to exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. Herein, we describe the revised absolute configurations of amidochelocardin and chelocardin using a combination of XRD, NMR, ECD, and TDDFT&#8208;ECD calculations. The absolute configuration assigned via XRD analysis for a closely related semisynthetic analogue of 6&#8208;desmethyl&#8208;chelocardin (1) also supports this conclusion.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Chelocardin and its bioengineered derivative, amidochelocardin, are known to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Herein, we describe the revised absolute configurations of amidochelocardin and chelocardin using a combination of XRD, NMR, ECD, and TDDFT-ECD calculations. The absolute configuration assigned via XRD analysis for a closely related semisynthetic analogue of 6-desmethyl-chelocardin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) also supports this conclusion.

         <title>Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the light&#8208;independent active repair of a bridged dinuclear RuII&#8208;tpphz&#8208;PtII photocatalyst highly active in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via ammonium persulfate. This enables improved revitalization of the photocatalyst, which &#8211; along with the innovative detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy &#8211; enhances the applicability of this repair mechanism for a wide field of reductive catalysts.







Abstract
Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real&#8208;time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative in situ technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non&#8208;invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light&#8208;driven catalysis enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.

         <title>Separating Xylene Isomers with a Calcium Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;dependent adsorption of xylene isomers on a calcium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework has led to full separation of p&#8208;xylene from its isomers with high selectivity.







Abstract
The purification of p&#8208;xylene (pX) from its xylene isomers represents a challenging but important industrial process. Herein, we report the efficient separation of pX from its ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208; isomers by a microporous calcium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material (HIAM&#8208;203) with a flexible skeleton. At 30&#8201;&#176;C, all three isomers are accommodated but the adsorption kinetics of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX) are substantially slower than that of pX, and at an elevated temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C, oX and mX are fully excluded while pX can be adsorbed. Multicomponent column breakthrough measurements and vapor&#8208;phase/liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments have demonstrated the capability of HIAM&#8208;203 for efficient separation of xylene isomers. Ab initio calculations have provided useful information for understanding the adsorption mechanism.

         <title>Phase Separation of DNA&#8208;Encoded Artificial Cells Boosts Signal Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell system, characterized by robust signal amplification through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and adaptable recognition patterns via molecular engineering is reported. The system is shown to function as a versatile, ultrasensitive biosensor.







Abstract
Life&#8208;like hierarchical architecture shows great potential for advancing intelligent biosensing, but modular expansion of its sensitivity and functionality remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, we discovered that a DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell with a liquid core (LAC) can enhance peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Hemin and its DNA G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer complex (DGAH) without substrate&#8208;selectivity, unlike its gelled core (GAC) counterpart. The LAC is easily engineered as an ultrasensitive biosensing system, benefiting from DNA&#8242;s high programmability and unique signal amplification capability mediated by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. As proof of concept, its versatility was successfully demonstrated by coupling with two molecular recognition elements to monitor tumor&#8208;related microRNA and profile cancer cell phenotypes. This scalable design philosophy offers new insights into the design of next generation of artificial cells&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>Bis&#8208; and Tris&#8208;norbornadienes with High Energy Densities for Efficient Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In search for novel efficient energy storage systems, aryl&#8208;linked bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;norbornadienes were synthesized with promising potential for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) applications. Above all, the assembly of three quadricyclane units in one benzene derivative resulted in a material with exeptionally high energy densities of up to 734&#8197;kJ/kg.







Abstract
Molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems can convert, store and release solar energy in chemical bonds, i.e., as chemical energy. In this work, phenyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;norbornadienes are presented as promising MOST systems with very high energy densities. The substrates were synthesized by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions and their absorption properties and characteristic parameters for MOST applications were investigated. The norbornadiene derivatives showed absorption onsets of up to 386&#8197;nm and photoisomerization quantum yields of 56&#8201;% per photoisomerization event. The resulting quadricyclane products have half&#8208;lifes up to 14 d and very high energy densities of up to 734&#8197;kJ/kg. Overall, these norbornadienes fulfill necessary criteria for an optimal MOST system and are, therefore, a highly promising basis for the development of materials for efficient solar energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis with Gaseous Molecular Ions: Harvesting [B12Br11N2]&#8722; from a Mass Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion [B12Br11N2]&#8722; was previously only observed in mass spectra. Reactions of gaseous fragment ions and high current ion soft&#8208;landing were combined to synthesize this molecular ion and enable its analysis by NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as to explore follow&#8208;up reactions in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry frequently reveals the existence of transient gas phase ions that have not been synthesized in solution or in bulk. These elusive ions are, therefore, often considered to be primarily of analytical value in fundamental gas phase studies. Here, we provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the products of ion&#8208;molecule reactions in mass spectrometers may be collected on surfaces to generate condensed matter and thus serve as building blocks to synthesize new compounds. The highly reactive fragment anion [B12Br11]&#8722; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B12Br11N2]&#8722; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass&#8208;selection and soft&#8208;landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B12Br11N2]&#8722;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B12Br11N2]&#8722; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N2 and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B12Br11]&#8722; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Thus, isolation of [B12Br11N2]&#8722; expands the repertoire of the available diazo ions that can be employed as versatile intermediates in various chemical transformations.

Here, we provide proof-of-concept that the products of ion-molecule reactions in mass spectrometers may be collected on surfaces to generate condensed matter and thus serve as building blocks to synthesize new compounds. The highly reactive fragment anion [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass-selection and soft-landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Thus, isolation of [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; expands the repertoire of the available diazo ions that can be employed as versatile intermediates in various chemical transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Foldamer&#8208;Based Artificial Lithium Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using pivaloyl chloride as a mild one&#8208;pot copolymerization agent, we successfully constructed a novel class of sulfur&#8208;containing aromatic amide helices. Having an average height of 2.1&#8197;nm, 3.6&#8197;&#197; in cavity diameter and helically arranged S&#8208; and O&#8208;atoms along the inner wall, these nanotubes display highly selective and efficient transmembrane lithium transport, with transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.







Abstract
Unlike many other biologically relevant ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl&#8722;, etc) and protons, whose cellular concentrations are closely regulated by highly selective channel proteins, Li+ ion is unusual in that its concentration is well tolerated over many orders of magnitude and that no lithium&#8208;specific channel proteins have so far been identified. While one naturally evolved primary pathway for Li+ ions to traverse across the cell membrane is through sodium channels by competing with Na+ ions, highly sought&#8208;after artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels remain a major challenge to develop. Here we show that sulfur&#8208;containing organic nanotubes derived from intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded helically folded aromatic foldamers of 3.6&#8197;&#197; in hollow cavity diameter could facilitate highly selective and efficient transmembrane transport of Li+ ions, with high transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.

         <title>Quadruple&#8208;Bidentate Nitrate&#8208;Ligated A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=K, Rb): Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Sufficient Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nonlinear optically active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=K (KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), which feature unique quadruple bidentate&#8208;ligand [Hg(NO3)4] modules, exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation responses, together with sufficient birefringences and short ultraviolet cutoff edges.







Abstract
The design of efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals continues to pose significant challenges due to the difficulty of assembling polar NLO&#8208;active modules in an optimal additive fashion. We report herein the first NLO&#8208;active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=(KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), for which assembly is induced by ionic polarization of the d10 cations. The two new crystalline compounds are isostructural, featuring interesting pseudo&#8208;diamond&#8208;like structures with parallel [Hg(NO3)4] modules, and leading to strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses of 9.2 (KHNO) and 8.8 (RHNO) times that of KH2PO4. In combination with the simple solution preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale crystals, sufficient birefringence, and short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges, these attributes make KHNO and RHNO promising candidates for UV NLO materials. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis reveal that the newly&#8208;developed highly condensed and distorted [Hg(NO3)4] module, with an Hg2+ cation that is quadruply bidentate nitrate&#8208;ligated, is crucial for the significant SHG responses. This work highlights the potential importance of modules with multiple bidentate ligands for the development of high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation NLO materials.

Abstract
A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds ((CH3)2C(PhY)&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)PhY) were prepared by selective cationic dimerization of &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene (&#945;MS) derivatives (CH2=C(CH3)PhY) with p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) via &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H scission. They were subsequently used as reversible chain transfer agents for sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization of &#945;MS via &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;C scission in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts such as SnCl4. In particular, exo&#8208;olefin compounds with electron&#8208;donating substituents, such as a 4&#8208;MeO group (Y) on the aromatic ring, worked as efficient cationic RAFT agents for &#945;MS to produce poly(&#945;MS) with controlled molecular weights and exo&#8208;olefin terminals. Other exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)(4&#8208;MeOPh)) with various R groups were prepared by different methods to examine the effects of R groups on the cationic RAFT polymerization. A sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization also proceeded for isobutylene (IB) with the exo&#8208;olefin &#945;MS dimer ((CH3)2C(Ph)&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Ph). Furthermore, telechelic poly(IB) with exo&#8208;olefins at both terminals was obtained with a bifunctional RAFT agent containing two exo&#8208;olefins. Finally, block copolymers of &#945;MS and methyl methacrylate (MMA) were prepared via mechanistic transformation from cationic to radical RAFT polymerization using exo&#8208;olefin terminals containing 4&#8208;MeOPh groups as common sulfur&#8208;free RAFT groups for both cationic and radical polymerizations.

         <title>H2&#8208;free Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Butadiene by the Atomic Sieving Effect of Pd Membrane with Tree&#8208;like Pd Dendrites Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen atomic sieving of Pd&#8208;based membrane under electrochemical condition was developed for solving the challenges of high energy consumption and safety hazards of the conventional thermocatalytic selective hydrogenation route. The Pd membrane with an array of tree&#8208;like Pd nanodendrites as the core device in the developed continuous flow reactor exhibits superior catalytic performance, with an elimination of extra impurities for a high industrial applicability.







Abstract
H2&#8208;free semi&#8208;hydrogenation at room temperature shows great advantage for replacing the thermocatalytic process in industry owing to the high energy and resource saving, however, remains great challenges. Herein, a tree&#8208;like Pd dendrites array decorated Pd membrane was constructed as the core device in an electrochemistry assisted gas&#8208;fed membrane reactor for butadiene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. It reveals that hydrogen atomic sieving effect of this Pd&#8208;based membrane under electrochemical condition was the key for semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The configuration study of Pd nanostructured membrane demonstrates that the penetration of hydrogen atoms through Pd membrane from electrochemical side to chemical side is affected by the consumption of hydrogen atom in semi&#8208;hydrogenation step. Such atomic sieving property of nanostructured Pd membrane with 5.1&#8197;times increase in catalytic active surface area brings above 14&#8197;times higher in butadiene conversion than that of bare Pd foil, with &#8776;90&#8201;% of butenes selectivity at butadiene conversion &#8776;98&#8201;% over 300&#8197;h of H2&#8208;free reaction under 15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen atomic sieving of Pd-based membrane under electrochemical condition was developed for solving the challenges of high energy consumption and safety hazards of the conventional thermocatalytic selective hydrogenation route. The Pd membrane with an array of tree-like Pd nanodendrites as the core device in the developed continuous flow reactor exhibits superior catalytic performance, with an elimination of extra impurities for a high industrial applicability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free semi-hydrogenation at room temperature shows great advantage for replacing the thermocatalytic process in industry owing to the high energy and resource saving, however, remains great challenges. Herein, a tree-like Pd dendrites array decorated Pd membrane was constructed as the core device in an electrochemistry assisted gas-fed membrane reactor for butadiene semi-hydrogenation. It reveals that hydrogen atomic sieving effect of this Pd-based membrane under electrochemical condition was the key for semi-hydrogenation. The configuration study of Pd nanostructured membrane demonstrates that the penetration of hydrogen atoms through Pd membrane from electrochemical side to chemical side is affected by the consumption of hydrogen atom in semi-hydrogenation step. Such atomic sieving property of nanostructured Pd membrane with 5.1&#8197;times increase in catalytic active surface area brings above 14&#8197;times higher in butadiene conversion than that of bare Pd foil, with &#8776;90&#8201;% of butenes selectivity at butadiene conversion &#8776;98&#8201;% over 300&#8197;h of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free reaction under 15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Sub&#8208;1&#8201;nm Nanosheets of Co&#8208;assembled MnZnCuOx and Polyoxometalate Clusters as Anodes for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets anode co&#8208;assembled by MnZnCuOx (MZC) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was successfully constructed via introducing PMA clusters into MZC and precisely controlling the amount of PMA. The non&#8208;covalent interactions endowed the nanosheets with excellent structural stability, while the electron&#8208;rich properties of PMA greatly increased Li+ adsorption energy, thus exhibiting outstanding lithium storage performance.







Abstract
Transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) usually suffer from serious volume expansion leading to the pulverization of structures, further giving rise to lower specific capacity and worse cycling stability. Herein, by introducing polyoxometalate (POM) clusters into TMOs and precisely controlling the amount of POMs, the MnZnCuOx&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets (MZC&#8208;PMA HSNSs) anode is successfully fabricated, where the special electron rich structure of POMs is conducive to accelerating the migration of lithium ions on the anode to obtain higher specific capacity, and the non&#8208;covalent interactions between POMs and TMOs make the HSNSs possess excellent structural and chemical stability, thus exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance in LIBs, achieving a high reversible capacity (1157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an admirable long&#8208;term cycling stability at low and high current densities.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive PROTACs for Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized caging strategy has been developed to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs. By leveraging pathological cues or external stimuli, we realized selective protein degradation and potent tumor remission in vitro and in vivo, making our caging library a promising tool in designing activatable prodrugs and smart biomaterials.







Abstract
Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represent a promising therapeutic modality to address undruggable and resistant issues in drug discovery. However, potential on&#8208;target toxicity remains clinically challenging. We developed a generalized caging strategy to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs (sr&#8208;PROTACs) with diverse molecular blocks bearing robust and cleavable linkers, presenting &#8220;turn on&#8221; features in manipulating protein degradation. By leveraging pathological cues, such as elevated ROS, phosphatase, H2S, or hypoxia, and external triggers, such as ultraviolet light, X&#8208;Ray, or bioorthogonal reagents, we achieved site&#8208;specific activation and traceless release of original PROTACs through de&#8208;caging and subsequent self&#8208;immolative cleavage, realizing selective uptake and controlled protein degradation in vitro. An in vivo study revealed that two sr&#8208;PROTACs with phosphate&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing cages exhibited high solubility and long plasma exposure, which were specifically activated by tumor overexpressing phosphatase or low dosage of X&#8208;Ray irradiation in situ, leading to efficient protein degradation and potent tumor remission. With more reactive biomarkers to be screened from clinical practice, our caging library could provide a general tool to design activatable PROTACs, prodrugs, antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and smart biomaterials for personalized treatment, tissue engineering or regenerative medicine.

         <title>Stabilizing Pt Single Atoms through Pt&#8722;Se Electron Bridges on Vacancy&#8208;enriched Nickel Selenide for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. The enriched vacancies of nickel selenide supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst with Pt&#8722;Se electron bridges exhibits an outstanding HER catalytic performance, which is ascribed to the accelerated electron transfer property, optimized water&#8208;dissociation ability and reduced reaction energy barrier.







Abstract
Rational design of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts provides a promising strategy to significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. The Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported by nickel selenide with rich vacancies was prepared via a hydrothermal&#8208;impregnation stepwise approach. Through experimental testation and DFT theoretical calculation, we confirm that Pt single atoms are well distributed at cationic vacancies of nickel selenide with loading amount of 3.2&#8197;wt.&#8201;%. Moreover, the atomic Pt combined with the high electronegative Se to form Pt&#8722;Se bond as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between single atoms and substrate for fast electron translation. This novel catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability over 120&#8197;h. Furthermore, the nickel selenide supported Pt SACs exhibits long&#8208;term stability for practical application, which maintains a high current density of 390&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 80&#8197;h with a retention of 99&#8201;%. This work points a promising direction for designing single atoms catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for advanced green energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External Stimulus&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer between metal sites in a Prussian blue structure serves as a switch to alter the water oxidation catalytic mechanism to an external stimulus&#8208;sensitive spin&#8208;crossover pathway.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic processes involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a kinetic bottleneck due to the existence of linear&#8208;scaling relationships, which bind the energies of the different intermediates in the mechanism limiting optimization. Here, we offer a way to break these scaling relationships and enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue modified electrode in OER by applying external stimuli. Improvements of &#8776;11&#8201;% and &#8776;57&#8201;% were achieved under magnetic field (0.2&#8197;T) and light irradiation (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively, when working at fixed overpotential, &#951;=0.6&#8197;V at pH&#8197;7. The observed enhancements strongly tie in with the intermetallic charge transfer (IMCT) intensity between Fe and Co sites. Density Functional Theory simulations suggest that tuning the IMCT can lead to a change of the OER mechanism to an external stimuli&#8208;sensitive spin crossover&#8208;based pathway, which opens the way for switchable electrocatalytic devices.

Abstract
The positive liquid crystals, 4&#8242;&#8208;heptyl&#8208;4&#8208;biphenylcarbonitrile (7CB), are used to functionalize carbon nanotubes (LC&#8208;CNT), which can be aligned in the liquid crystalline polyimide (LC&#8208;PI) matrix under an alternating electric field to fabricate the thermally conductive LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films. The efficient establishment of thermal conduction pathways in thermally conductive LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films with a low amount of LC&#8208;CNT is achieved through the oriented alignment of LC&#8208;CNT within the LC&#8208;PI matrix. When the mass fraction of LC&#8208;CNT is 15 wt&#8201;%, the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;&#8741;) and the through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;&#8869;) of the LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films reach 4.02&#8197;W/(m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K) and 0.55&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K), which are 90.5&#8201;% and 71.9&#8201;% higher than those of the intrinsically thermally conductive LC&#8208;PI films respectively, also 28.8&#8201;% and 5.8&#8201;% higher than those of the CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films respectively. Meanwhile, the thermally conductive LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films also possess excellent mechanical and heat resistance properties. The Young's modulus and the heat resistance index are 2.3&#8197;GPa and 297.7&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, which are higher than the intrinsically thermally conductive LC&#8208;PI films and the thermally conductive CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films under the same amount of CNT.

         <title>Key Strategies for Enhancing H2 Production in Transition Metal Oxide Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview critically discusses the most promising strategies to improve hydrogen evolution on transition metal based photocatalysts along with future research directions.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) were one of the first photocatalysts used to produce hydrogen from water using solar energy. Despite the emergence of many other genres of photocatalysts over the years, TMO photocatalysts remain dominant due to their easy synthesis and unique physicochemical properties. Various strategies have been developed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TMOs, but the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of TMO photocatalysts is still very low (&lt;2&#8201;%), which is far below the targeted STH of 10&#8201;% for commercial viability. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of several widely used strategies, including oxygen defects control, doping, establishing interfacial junctions, and phase&#8208;facet&#8208;morphology engineering, that have been adopted to improve TMO photocatalysts. By critically evaluating these strategies and providing a roadmap for future research directions, this article serves as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals seeking to develop efficient energy materials for green energy solutions.

         <title>Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis at High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Correlates with its Composition&#8208;Dependent Potential of Zero Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) experiments on a thin&#8208;film Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag high&#8208;entropy alloy materials&#8208;library (HEA&#8208;ML) reveal that the potential of zero charge (PZC) of different compositions of the Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag HEA has a linear correlation with its composition&#8208;weighted average of the work function, and positively correlates with its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities in acidic media.







Abstract
The vast possibilities in the elemental combinations of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) make it essential to discover activity descriptors for establishing rational electrocatalyst design principles. Despite the increasing attention on the potential of zero charge (PZC) of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, neither the PZC of HEAs nor the impact of the PZC on the HER activity at HEAs has been described. Here, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) to determine the PZC and the HER activities of various elemental compositions of a Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag thin&#8208;film HEA materials library (HEA&#8208;ML) with high statistical reliability. Interestingly, the PZC of Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag is linearly correlated with its composition&#8208;weighted average work function. The HER current density in acidic media positively correlates with the PZC, which can be explained by the preconcentration of H+ in the electrical double layer at potentials negative of the PZC.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding Enables a Zwitterionic Mechanism for Macrocyclic Peptide Formation: Computational Mechanistic Studies of CyClick Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a detailed computational investigation on reaction mechanisms of the macrocyclization of linear peptide aldehydes to selectively form imidazolidinone cyclic peptides. Our work demonstrates that intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) act as transient internal factors to control stereoselectivity by promoting a kinetically facile zwitterionic mechanism.







Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides have become increasingly important in the pharmaceutical industry. We present a detailed computational investigation of the reaction mechanism of the recently developed &#8220;CyClick&#8221; chemistry to selectively form imidazolidinone cyclic peptides from linear peptide aldehydes, without using catalysts or directing groups (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 19073&#8211;19080). We conducted computational mechanistic to investigate the effects of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) in promoting a kinetically facile zwitterionic mechanism in &#8220;CyClick&#8221; of pentapeptide aldehyde AFGPA. Our DFT calculations highlighted the importance of IMHB in pre&#8208;organization of the resting state, stabilization of the zwitterion intermediate, and the control of the product stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have also identified that the low ring strain energy promotes the &#8220;CyClick&#8221; of hexapeptide aldehyde AAGPFA to form a thermodynamically more stable 15+5 imidazolidinone cyclic peptide product. In contrast, large ring strain energy suppresses &#8220;CyClick&#8221; reactivity of tetra peptide aldehyde AFPA from forming the 9+5 imidazolidinone cyclic peptide product.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Induced Charge Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering on a Semiconductor: Toward Amplification&#8208;Free Quantification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu2O nanoarray with a significant enhancement factor of 3.19&#215;1010 was developed as a highly sensitive and selective surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering device for the amplification&#8208;free SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA testing. The nanoarray chip has a low detection limit for the virus, down to 60&#8197;copies/mL within 5&#8197;min, which also enabled rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care quantification of other emerging virus variants.







Abstract
Semiconductors demonstrate great potentials as chemical mechanism&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates in determination of biological species in complex living systems with high selectivity. However, low sensitivity is the bottleneck for their practical applications, compared with that of noble metal&#8208;based Raman enhancement ascribed to electromagnetic mechanism. Herein, a novel Cu2O nanoarray with free carrier density of 1.78&#215;1021&#8197;cm&#8722;3 comparable to that of noble metals was self&#8208;assembled, creating a record in enhancement factor (EF) of 3.19&#215;1010 among semiconductor substrates. The significant EF was mainly attributed to plasmon&#8208;induced hot electron transfer (PIHET) in semiconductor which was never reported before. This Cu2O nanoarray was subsequently developed as a highly sensitive and selective SERS chip for non&#8208;enzyme and amplification&#8208;free SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA quantification with a detection limit down to 60&#8197;copies/mL within 5&#8197;min. This unique Cu2O nanoarray demonstrated the significant Raman enhancement through PIHET process, enabling rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of emerging virus variants.

This unique Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanoarray demonstrated the significant Raman enhancement through PIHET process, enabling rapid and sensitive point-of-care testing of emerging virus variants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile, Versatile and Stepwise Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Oligomer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise method proposed to synthesize non&#8208;fullerene oligomer acceptors via consecutive Stille coupling reactions offers significant advantages compared to the traditional approach, resulting in fewer unwanted by&#8208;products and easier purification processes. By utilizing this method, the obtained Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based organic solar cells achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, along with excellent stability.







Abstract
Oligomer acceptors have recently emerged as promising photovoltaic materials for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited availability of diverse acceptors, resulting from the sole synthetic approach, has hindered their potential for future industrialization. In this study, we present a facile and effective stepwise approach that utilizes two consecutive Stille coupling reactions for the synthesis of oligomer acceptors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach, we successfully synthesize a trimer acceptor, Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD, and further systematically investigate the impact of oligomerization on device performance and stability. The results reveal that this approach has significant advantages compared to the conventional method, including reduced formation of unwanted by&#8208;products and lower difficulties in purification. Remarkably, the OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD achieves an impressive PCE of 18.03&#8201;% and maintains 80&#8201;% of the initial PCE (T80) for 1523&#8197;h under illumination, surpassing the performance of the corresponding small molecule acceptor Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based device. Furthermore, the versatility of the synthetic strategy in obtaining diverse acceptors is further demonstrated. Overall, our findings provide a facile, versatile and stepwise way for synthesizing oligomer acceptors, thereby facilitating the development of stable and efficient OSCs.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation Allows Protecting Group&#8208;Free and Stereoselective&#160;O&#8208;Glycosylation of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a simple and general method to achieve fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids, employing bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities. Both the donor activation stage and the glycosidic bond forming stage of the process are compatible with free hydroxyl groups, thereby allowing for the use of fully unprotected glycosyl donors. This transformation is stereoconvergent, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions at ambient temperature with visible light (455 nm) irradiation, and displays remarkable scope with respect to both reaction partners. Many natural products and commercial drugs, including an acid derived from the complex anticancer agent taxol, were efficiently glycosylated. Experimental studies provide insights into the origin of the stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Electrochemistry Enables Practical and Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective oxygenation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds remains a highly sought&#8208;after method in both academia and the chemical industry for constructing functionalized organic molecules. However, it is extremely challenging to selectively oxidize a certain C(sp3)&#8211;H bond to afford alcohols due to the presence of multiple C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with similar strength and steric environment in organic molecules, and the alcohol products being prone to further oxidation. Herein, we present a practical and cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical method for the highly selective monooxygenation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds using continuous flow reactors. The electrochemical reactions produce trifluoroacetate esters that are resistant to further oxidation but undergo facile hydrolysis during aqueous workup to form benzylic alcohols. The method exhibits a broad scope and exceptional site selectivity and requires no catalysts or chemical oxidants. Furthermore, the electrochemical method demonstrates excellent scalability by producing 115 g of one of the alcohol products. The high site selectivity of the electrochemical method originates from its unique mechanism to cleave benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds through sequential electron/proton transfer, rather than the commonly employed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Corrole Radicals by Polycyclic Aromatic Fusion: Towards Open&#8208;Shell Near&#8208;Infrared Materials for Efficient Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell radicals are promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs) owing to their easily accessible narrow band gaps, but their stabilization and functionalization remain challenging. Herein, highly stable &#960;&#8208;extended nickel corrole radicals with [4n+1] &#960; systems are synthesized and used to prepare NIR&#8208;absorbing PTAs for efficient phototheranostics. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of corrole radicals gradually improves as the number of fused benzene rings on &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic locations increases radially, with naphthalene&#8208; and anthracene&#8208;fused radicals and their one&#8208;electron oxidized [4n] &#960; cations exhibiting panchromatic visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption. The extremely low doublet excited states of corrole radicals promote heat generation via nonradiative decay. By encapsulating naphthocorrole radicals with amphiphilic polymer, water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles Na&#8208;NPs are produced, which exhibit outstanding photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency of 71.8%. In vivo anti&#8208;tumor therapy results indicate that Na&#8208;NPs enable photoacoustic imaging of tumors and act as biocompatible PTAs for tumor ablation when triggered by 808 nm laser light. The&#8220;aromatic&#8208;ring fusion&#8221;strategy for energy&#8208;gap tuning of corrole radicals opens a new platform for developing robust NIR&#8208;absorbing photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Darobactin B Stabilises a Lateral&#8208;Closed Conformation of the BAM Complex in E. coli Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>

The darobactins are promising new antibiotics that inhibit the BAM complex, an essential membrane&#8208;protein foldase in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Here, we use EPR spectroscopy (PELDOR, or DEER) distance measurements to monitor the effect of darobactin B on BAM in E.&#8197;coli cells, showing it stabilises BAM in a lateral gate closed conformational state. Our results provide the first direct evidence for conformational selection by a darobactin in the cellular context.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM complex) is essential for outer membrane protein (OMP) folding in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, and represents a promising antimicrobial target. Several conformational states of BAM have been reported, but all have been obtained under conditions which lack the unique features and complexity of the outer membrane (OM). Here, we use Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR, or DEER) spectroscopy distance measurements to interrogate the conformational ensemble of the BAM complex in E.&#8197;coli cells. We show that BAM adopts a broad ensemble of conformations in the OM, while in the presence of the antibiotic darobactin B (DAR&#8208;B), BAM&#8242;s conformational equilibrium shifts to a restricted ensemble consistent with the lateral closed state. Our in&#8208;cell PELDOR findings are supported by new cryoEM structures of BAM in the presence and absence of DAR&#8208;B. This work demonstrates the utility of PELDOR to map conformational changes in BAM within its native cellular environment.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Response Nickel&#8208;Promoted Indium Oxide Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation from Intermittent Solar Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a distributed CO2 utilization system incorporating a fluctuating H2 supply. Ni loaded on In2O3 reduces the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2. The system exhibits a faster response (12&#8197;min) than bare oxide catalysts (42&#8197;min). Ni enhances the sensitivity of the catalyst to H2, enabling good performance at lower H2 concentrations and adaptability to a wide H2 fluctuation range compared to In2O3.







Abstract
Construction of a &#8220;net&#8208;zero&#8208;emission&#8221; system through CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with solar energy is an eco&#8208;friendly way to mitigate the greenhouse effect. Traditional CO2 hydrogenation demands centralized mass production for cost reduction with mass water electrolysis for hydrogen supply. To achieve continuous reaction with intermittent and fluctuating flow of H2 on a small&#8208;scale for distributed application scenarios, modulating the catalyst interface environment and chemical adsorption capacity to adapt fluctuating reaction conditions is highly desired. This paper describes a distributed clean CO2 utilization system in which the surface structure of catalysts is carefully regulated. The Ni catalyst with unsaturated electrons loaded on In2O3 can reduce the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2 supply, exhibiting a faster response (12&#8197;min) than bare oxide catalysts (42&#8197;min). Moreover, the introduction of Ni enhances the sensitivity of the catalyst to hydrogen, yielding a Ni/In2O3 catalyst with a good performance at lower H2 concentrations with a 15&#8197;times adaptability for wider hydrogen fluctuation range than In2O3, greatly reducing the negative impact of unstable H2 supplies derived from renewable energies.

         <title>Highly Oxidative&#8208;Resistant Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Lithium Borate Salt for Enhanced Cycling Performance of Practical Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly oxidative&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;functionalized lithium borate salt, lithium difluoro(1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) borate (LiDFTCB), is designed to enhance cycling performance of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Owing to its intrinsic anionic structure and the thin and robust electrolyte/electrode layers formed by LiDFTCB, the LiCoO2/graphite cells show superior cycling stability at 50&#8201;&#176;C with barely any CO2 gas evolution.







Abstract
Lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) has been widely investigated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its advantageous thermal stability and excellent aluminum passivation property. However, LiDFOB tends to suffer from severe decomposition and generate a lot of gas species (e.g., CO2). Herein, a novel cyano&#8208;functionalized lithium borate salt, namely lithium difluoro(1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) borate (LiDFTCB), is innovatively synthesized as a highly oxidative&#8208;resistant salt to alleviate above dilemma. It is revealed that the LiDFTCB&#8208;based electrolyte enables LiCoO2/graphite cells with superior capacity retention at both room and elevated temperatures (e.g., 80&#8201;% after 600&#8197;cycles) with barely any CO2 gas evolution. Systematic studies reveal that LiDFTCB tends to form thin and robust interfacial layers at both electrodes. This work emphasizes the crucial role of cyano&#8208;functionalized anions in improving cycle lifespan and safety of practical LIBs.

         <title>Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Nanopipettes for the Capture and Dynamic Analysis of a Single Mitochondrion inside One Living Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified nanopipette was designed to capture one target mitochondrion labeled with an azide&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (TPP&#8208;N3) via a click reaction at the nanopipette tip between DBCO and TPP&#8208;N3. The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the captured mitochondrion can thus be dynamically monitored, without interference by species present in the cytosol.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of single cells requires the dynamically molecular information in one particular nanometer&#8208;sized organelle in a living cell, which is difficult to achieve using current methods. Due to high efficiency of click chemistry, a new nanoelectrode&#8208;based pipette architecture with dibenzocyclooctyne at the tip is designed to realize fast conjugation with azide group&#8208;containing triphenylphosphine, which targets mitochondrial membranes. The covalent binding of one mitochondrion at the tip of the nanopipette allows a small region of the membrane to be isolated on the Pt surface inside the nanopipette. Therefore, the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the mitochondrion is monitored, which is not interfered by the species present in the cytosol. The dynamic tracking of ROS release from one mitochondrion reveals the distinctive &#8220;ROS&#8208;induced ROS release&#8221; within the mitochondria. Further study of RSL3&#8208;induced ferroptosis using nanopipettes provides direct evidence for supporting the noninvolvement of glutathione peroxidase 4 in the mitochondria during RSL3&#8208;induced ROS generation, which has not previously been observed at the single&#8208;mitochondrion level. Eventually, this established strategy should overcome the existing challenge of the dynamic measurement of one special organelle in the complicated intracellular environment, which opens a new direction for electroanalysis in subcellular analysis.

We synthesized novel TiO2@MoS2@NC multi&#8208;heterostructure with photoelectric conversion and electronic transfer interfaces as a dual&#8208;functional photoelectrode for ultrafast sodium ion storage. Benefitting from the unique multi&#8208;heterostructures and superstructural toughness, it showed excellent electrochemical performance and rapid kinetics in half/full sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), as well as massive potential in photo&#8208;SIBs.







Abstract
Exploiting dual&#8208;functional photoelectrodes to harvest and store solar energy is a challenging but efficient way for achieving renewable energy utilization. Herein, multi&#8208;heterostructures consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon coated MoS2 nanosheets supported by tubular TiO2 with photoelectric conversion and electronic transfer interfaces are designed. When a photo sodium ion battery (photo&#8208;SIB) is assembled based on the heterostructures, its capacity increases to 399.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high photo&#8208;conversion efficiency of 0.71&#8201;% switching from dark to visible light at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Remarkably, the photo&#8208;SIB can be recharged by light only, with a striking capacity of 231.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that the proposed multi&#8208;heterostructures can enhance charge transfer kinetics, maintain structural stability, and facilitate the separation of photo&#8208;excited carriers. This work presents a new strategy to design dual&#8208;functional photoelectrodes for efficient use of solar energy.

         <title>Experimental Confirmation of a Predicted Porous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework that was predicted previously to have 3D porosity and a remarkably low density of 0.37&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3 has been discovered experimentally. The structure of this framework matches the original prediction precisely and it has an accessible surface area of 3,284&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, as measured by nitrogen adsorption, making it one of the most porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks synthesized to date.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with low densities and high porosities are rare and challenging to design because most molecules have a strong energetic preference for close packing. Crystal structure prediction (CSP) can rank the crystal packings available to an organic molecule based on their relative lattice energies. This has become a powerful tool for the a priori design of porous molecular crystals. Previously, we combined CSP with structure&#8208;property predictions to generate energy&#8208;structure&#8208;function (ESF) maps for a series of triptycene&#8208;based molecules with quinoxaline groups. From these ESF maps, triptycene trisquinoxalinedione (TH5) was predicted to form a previously unknown low&#8208;energy HOF (TH5&#8208;A) with a remarkably low density of 0.374&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pores. Here, we demonstrate the reliability of those ESF maps by discovering this TH5&#8208;A polymorph experimentally. This material has a high accessible surface area of 3,284&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, as measured by nitrogen adsorption, making it one of the most porous HOFs reported to date.

         <title>Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with Precursor Coisolation Improves Proteome Coverage and Measurement Throughput for Label&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics

A new data acquisition strategy for biological mass spectrometry, termed wide&#8208;window acquisition, combined with efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography, enables single&#8208;cell proteome profiling to an unprecedented depth of &gt;3000 proteins per cell. This advance allows additional classes of proteins to be studied within single cells.







Abstract
We combined efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography with a newly developed data acquisition and analysis scheme termed wide window acquisition (WWA) to quantify &gt;3,000 proteins from single cells in rapid label&#8208;free analyses. WWA employs large isolation windows to intentionally co&#8208;isolate and co&#8208;fragment adjacent precursors along with the selected precursor. Optimized WWA increased the number of MS2&#8208;identified proteins by &#8776;40&#8201;% relative to standard data&#8208;dependent acquisition. For a 40&#8208;min LC gradient operated at &#8776;15 nL/min, we identified an average of 3,524 proteins per single&#8208;cell&#8208;sized aliquot of protein digest. Reducing the active gradient to 20&#8197;min resulted in a modest 10&#8201;% decrease in proteome coverage. Using this platform, we compared protein expression between single HeLa cells having an essential autophagy gene, atg9a, knocked out, with their isogenic WT parental line. Similar proteome coverage was observed, and 268 proteins were significantly up&#8208; or downregulated. Protein upregulation primarily related to innate immunity, vesicle trafficking and protein degradation.

         <title>Methane Oxidation over Cu2+/[CuOH]+ Pairs and Site&#8208;Specific Kinetics in Copper Mordenite Revealed by Operando Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and UV/Visible Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite zeolites has been determined and site&#8208;specific redox&#8208;behavior and kinetic properties of monomeric and dimeric Cu2+ active sites in partial CH4 oxidation have been analyzed by a complementary, multi&#8208;spectroscopic approach involving different operando and in situ techniques. Evidence for the participation of a [CuOH]+/Cu2+ site pair in CH4 conversion is provided.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite (MOR) is a promising material for partial CH4 oxidation. The structural diversity of Cu species within MOR makes it difficult to identify the active Cu sites and to determine their redox and kinetic properties. In this study, the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;MOR materials with different Cu loadings has been determined using operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy as well as in situ photoluminescence (PL) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A novel pathway for CH4 oxidation involving paired [CuOH]+ and bare Cu2+ species has been identified. The reduction of bare Cu2+ ions facilitated by adjacent [CuOH]+ demonstrates that the frequently reported assumption of redox&#8208;inert Cu2+ centers does not generally apply. The measured site&#8208;specific reaction kinetics show that dimeric Cu species exhibit a faster reaction rate and a higher apparent activation energy than monomeric Cu2+ active sites highlighting their difference in the CH4 oxidation potential.

         <title>Hierarchical LTL Zeolite as an Efficient and Sustainable Solid Acid Catalyst for Replacing HCl in the Production of Polyurethane Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits remarkable catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in the conversion of aminal to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA), an important precursor for polyurethane production. External Br&#248;nsted acid sites convert aminal to aminobenzylaniline, whereas 1D cage&#8208;like micropores induces self&#8208;assembly of two linear para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline molecules and their bimolecular conversion into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDAs.







Abstract
In many industrially important reactions, caustic mineral acid catalysts have been successfully replaced with green solid acids such as zeolites. In this context, extensive efforts have been devoted to replacing HCl to produce methylenedianiline (MDA), a key intermediate in polyurethane production. Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved thus far due to low activity, selectivity towards the desired 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA, and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here we report that meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits unprecedentedly high activity, selectivity, and stability. The one&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like micropores of LTL promote the bimolecular reaction between two para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline intermediates to selectively produce 4,4&#8242;&#8208;MDA and inhibit the formation of undesired isomers and heavy oligomers. Meanwhile, the secondary mesopores alleviate mass transfer limitations, resulting in a 7.8&#8208;fold higher MDA formation rate compared to solely microporous LTL zeolite. Due to suppressed oligomer formation and fast mass transfer, the catalyst exhibits inappreciable deactivation in an industrially relevant continuous flow reactor.

     alt="Hierarchical LTL Zeolite as an Efficient and Sustainable Solid Acid Catalyst for Replacing HCl in the Production of Polyurethane Intermediates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meso-/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits remarkable catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in the conversion of aminal to 4,4&#8242;-methylenedianiline (4,4&#8242;-MDA), an important precursor for polyurethane production. External Br&#248;nsted acid sites convert aminal to aminobenzylaniline, whereas 1D cage-like micropores induces self-assembly of two linear &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-aminobenzylaniline molecules and their bimolecular conversion into 4,4&#8242;-MDAs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many industrially important reactions, caustic mineral acid catalysts have been successfully replaced with green solid acids such as zeolites. In this context, extensive efforts have been devoted to replacing HCl to produce methylenedianiline (MDA), a key intermediate in polyurethane production. Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved thus far due to low activity, selectivity towards the desired 4,4&#8242;-MDA, and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here we report that meso-/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits unprecedentedly high activity, selectivity, and stability. The one-dimensional cage-like micropores of LTL promote the bimolecular reaction between two &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-aminobenzylaniline intermediates to selectively produce 4,4&#8242;-MDA and inhibit the formation of undesired isomers and heavy oligomers. Meanwhile, the secondary mesopores alleviate mass transfer limitations, resulting in a 7.8-fold higher MDA formation rate compared to solely microporous LTL zeolite. Due to suppressed oligomer formation and fast mass transfer, the catalyst exhibits inappreciable deactivation in an industrially relevant continuous flow reactor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anodic and Cathodic Platinum Dissolution Processes Involve Different Oxide Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt dissolves transiently during formation and reduction of ultrathin Pt surface oxides, leading to deterioration of Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction electrocatalysts in fuel cells. We observe the formation of two specific Pt surface oxides on Pt(100) and determine their atomic&#8208;scale structure. Pt dissolution during oxidation can be linked to growth of the inner stripe&#8208;like oxide; dissolution during oxide reduction involves the outer amorphous oxide.







Abstract
The degradation of Pt&#8208;containing oxygen reduction catalysts for fuel cell applications is strongly linked to the electrochemical surface oxidation and reduction of Pt. Here, we study the surface restructuring and Pt dissolution mechanisms during oxidation/reduction for the case of Pt(100) in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4 by combining operando high&#8208;energy surface X&#8208;ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry, and density functional theory. Our atomic&#8208;scale structural studies reveal that anodic dissolution, detected during oxidation, and cathodic dissolution, observed during the subsequent reduction, are linked to two different oxide phases. Anodic dissolution occurs predominantly during nucleation and growth of the first, stripe&#8208;like oxide. Cathodic dissolution is linked to a second, amorphous Pt oxide phase that resembles bulk PtO2 and starts to grow when the coverage of the stripe&#8208;like oxide saturates. In addition, we find the amount of surface restructuring after an oxidation/reduction cycle to be potential&#8208;independent after the stripe&#8208;like oxide has reached its saturation coverage.

         <title>Polyketide Synthase&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Methyloxime Formation in the Biosynthesis of the Oximidine Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anticancer agent oximidine I and three novel variants were discovered as products of a cryptic trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS in Pseudomonas baetica. By manipulating the biosynthetic pathway, a key intermediate was identified that retains potent anticancer properties. A combination of bioinformatics analysis and genetic and biochemical experiments illuminated the oximidine biosynthetic pathway, including a novel mechanism for O&#8208;methyloxime formation.







Abstract
Bacterial trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are modular megaenzymes that employ unusual catalytic domains to assemble diverse bioactive natural products. One such PKS is responsible for the biosynthesis of the oximidine anticancer agents, oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides that inhibit vacuolar H+&#8208;ATPases. Here, we describe the identification of the oximidine gene cluster in Pseudomonas baetica and the characterization of four novel oximidine variants, including a structurally simpler intermediate that retains potent anticancer activity. Using a combination of in vivo, in vitro and computational approaches, we experimentally elucidate the oximidine biosynthetic pathway and reveal an unprecedented mechanism for O&#8208;methyloxime formation. We show that this process involves a specialized monooxygenase and methyltransferase domain and provide insight into their activity, mechanism and specificity. Our findings expand the catalytic capabilities of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and identify potential strategies for the production of novel oximidine analogues.

         <title>Modular Oxime Formation by a trans&#8208;AT Polyketide Synthase</title>

         <dc:description>
Benzolactone enamides, a number of which incorporate a methylated oxime moiety, are produced by a range of organisms, and constitute a family of cytotoxic natural products. Here, we determine how this capped oxime group is installed during assembly of the model polyketide lobatamide by a modular trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase and provide molecular insight into the responsible mono&#8208;oxygenase domain by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Modular trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are enzymatic assembly lines that biosynthesize complex polyketide natural products. Relative to their better studied cis&#8208;AT counterparts, the trans&#8208;AT PKSs introduce remarkable chemical diversity into their polyketide products. A notable example is the lobatamide A PKS, which incorporates a methylated oxime. Here we demonstrate biochemically that this functionality is installed on&#8208;line by an unusual oxygenase&#8208;containing bimodule. Furthermore, analysis of the oxygenase crystal structure coupled with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allows us to propose a model for catalysis, as well as identifying key protein&#8208;protein interactions that support this chemistry. Overall, our work adds oxime&#8208;forming machinery to the biomolecular toolbox available for trans&#8208;AT PKS engineering, opening the way to introducing such masked aldehyde functionalities into diverse polyketides.

         <title>p&#8208;Block Bismuth Nanoclusters Sites Activated by Atomically Dispersed Bismuth for Tandem Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based electrocatalyst composed of bismuth nanoclusters and atomically dispersed bismuth is prepared for highly selective electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction producing hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms, demonstrating synergistic catalysis between single&#8208;atomic sites and nanoclusters.







Abstract
Constructing electrocatalysts with p&#8208;block elements is generally considered rather challenging owing to their closed d shells. Here for the first time, we present a p&#8208;block&#8208;element bismuth&#8208;based (Bi&#8208;based) catalyst with the co&#8208;existence of single&#8208;atomic Bi sites coordinated with oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) atoms and Bi nanoclusters (Biclu) (collectively denoted as BiOSSA/Biclu) for the highly selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As a result, BiOSSA/Biclu gives a high H2O2 selectivity of 95&#8201;% in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode, and a large current density of 36&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.15&#8197;V vs. RHE, a considerable H2O2 yield of 11.5&#8197;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with high H2O2 Faraday efficiency of &#8764;90&#8201;% at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE and a long&#8208;term durability of &#8764;22&#8197;h in H&#8208;cell test. Interestingly, the experimental data on site poisoning and theoretical calculations both revealed that, for BiOSSA/Biclu, the catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms. This work demonstrates a new synergistic tandem strategy for advanced p&#8208;block&#8208;element Bi catalysts featuring atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites, and the great potential of rational material design for constructing highly active electrocatalysts based on p&#8208;block metals.

As a result, BiOS&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;clu&lt;/sub&gt; gives a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 95&#8201;% in rotating ring-disk electrode, and a large current density of 36&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.15&#8197;V vs. RHE, a considerable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 11.5&#8197;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Faraday efficiency of &#8764;90&#8201;% at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE and a long-term durability of &#8764;22&#8197;h in H-cell test. Interestingly, the experimental data on site poisoning and theoretical calculations both revealed that, for BiOS&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;clu&lt;/sub&gt;, the catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms. This work demonstrates a new synergistic tandem strategy for advanced &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-block-element Bi catalysts featuring atomic-level catalytic sites, and the great potential of rational material design for constructing highly active electrocatalysts based on &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-block metals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Bridge on Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bridge link strategy for buried surface with perovskite provides superior defect passivation and energy alignment by employing the rationally selected mediator of glycocyamine. The interface enables slower crystal growth with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes. The modified planar perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.70&#8201;% with an open circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V and retains 89&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 800&#8197;h.







Abstract
The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly important for charge transfer and device stability, while the buried interface with the impact on perovskite film growth has been paid less attention. Herein, we use a molecular modifier, glycocyamine (GDA) to build a molecular bridge on the buried interface of SnO2/perovskite, resulting in superior interfacial contact. This is achieved through the strongly interaction between GDA and SnO2, which also appreciably modulates the energy level. Moreover, GDA can regulate the perovskite crystal growth, yielding perovskite film with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes, exhibiting substantially reduced defect density. Consequently, PSCs with GDA modification demonstrate significant improvement of open circuit voltage (close to 1.2&#8197;V) and fill factor, leading to an improved power conversion efficiency from 22.60&#8201;% to 24.70&#8201;%. Additionally, stabilities of GDA devices under maximum power point and 85&#8201;&#176;C heat both perform better than the control devices.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition as Access to Antitumor&#8208;Active Spirocyclic Oxindoles from Alkynes and Isatin&#8208;Derived Ketimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protocol for the synthesis of spirooxindoles that possess excellent antiproliferative activity on human tumor cell lines was achieved through a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction of alkynes with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines. Various functionalized and readily available alkynes reacted under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Due to its excellent bioactivity profile, which is increasingly utilized in pharmaceutical and synthetic chemistry, spirooxindole is an important core scaffold. We herein describe an efficient method for the construction of highly functionalized new spirooxindolocarbamates via a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction of terminal alkynes or ynamides with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines. This protocol has a good functional group compatibility, uses readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, low catalyst loadings and no additives. It enables the transformation of various functionalized alkyne groups into cyclic carbamates. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved and DFT calculations verify the feasibility of the mechanistic proposal. Some of the target products exhibit good to excellent antiproliferative activity on human tumor cell lines. In addition, one of the most active compounds displayed a remarkable selectivity towards tumor cells over normal ones.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen Vacancies via Engineering Heterostructured Fe3C/Fe3O4 Catalysts for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective and feasible strategy to engineer oxygen vacancies in situ by constructing a heterojunction of Fe3C/Fe3O4 that enables an &#8220;optimized activation&#8208;desorption&#8221; system for the electrochemical conversion of N2 into NH3. Combined with experimental results and DFT calculations, the synergistic effect between oxygen vacancies and heterojunction was further elucidated.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions provides an intriguing pathway to convert N2 into NH3. However, significant kinetic barriers of the NRR at low temperatures in desirable aqueous electrolytes remain a grand challenge due to the inert N&#8801;N bond of the N2 molecule. Herein, we propose a unique strategy for in situ oxygen vacancy construction to address the significant trade&#8208;off between N2 adsorption and NH3 desorption by building a hollow shell structured Fe3C/Fe3O4 heterojunction coated with carbon frameworks (Fe3C/Fe3O4@C). In the heterostructure, the Fe3C triggers the oxygen vacancies of the Fe3O4 component, which are likely active sites for the NRR. The design could optimize the adsorption strength of the N2 and NxHy intermediates, thus boosting the catalytic activity for the NRR. This work highlights the significance of the interaction between defect and interface engineering for regulating electrocatalytic properties of heterostructured catalysts for the challenging NRR. It could motivate an in&#8208;depth exploration to advance N2 reduction to ammonia.

         <title>Trinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation of styrenes with unactivated alkyl bromides has been developed using a trinuclear gold&#8208;catalyst. This protocol exhibits a broad reaction scope and excellent functional group compatibility (&gt;100&#8197;examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield). It also affords a robust formal [2+2+1] cyclization strategy for the concise construction of tetrahydropyrrole skeleton.







Abstract
Activated alkyl halides have been extensively explored to generate alkyl radicals with Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208; photocatalysts for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes, but unactivated alkyl bromides remain challenging substrates due to their strong reduction potential. Here we report a three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction of alkenes, unactivated alkyl bromides and nucleophiles (e.g., amines and indoles) using a trinuclear gold catalyst [Au3(tppm)2](OTf)3. It can achieve the 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation readily. This protocol has a broad reaction scope and excellent functional group compatibility (&gt;100&#8197;examples with up to 96&#8201;% yield). It also affords a robust formal [2+2+1] cyclization strategy for the concise construction of pyrrolidine skeletons under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support an inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer pathway for the successful cleavage of inert C&#8722;Br bonds.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Assisted Ball Assembly for Solvent&#8208;Processing the C60 Electron Transport Layer of High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bowl (corannulene)&#8208;assisted ball (fullerene) assembly strategy for solution&#8208;processing the favorable C60 electron transport layer (ETL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was deliberately proposed, delivering a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.7&#8201;% with an excellent light&#8208;soaking stability of 1000&#8197;hours, which highlights the great potential of corannulene in solubilizing and stabilizing C60 for efficient and stable PSCs.







Abstract
Pristine fullerene C60 is an excellent electron transport material for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inverted structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but its low solubility leaves thermal evaporation as the only method for depositing it into a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL). To address this problem, we herein introduce a highly soluble bowl&#8208;shaped additive, corannulene, to assist in C60&#8208;assembly into a smooth and compact film through the favorable bowl&#8208;ball interaction. Our results show that not only corannulene can dramatically enhance the film formability of C60, it also plays a critical role in forming C60&#8208;corannulene (CC) supramolecular species and in boosting intermolecular electron transport dynamics in the ETL. This strategy has allowed CC devices to deliver high power conversion efficiencies up to 21.69&#8201;%, which is the highest value among the PSCs based on the solution&#8208;processed&#8208;C60 (SP&#8208;C60) ETL. Moreover, the stability of the CC device is far superior to that of the C60&#8208;only device because corannulene can retard and curb the spontaneous aggregation of C60. This work establishes the bowl&#8208;assisted ball assembly strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient SP&#8208;C60 ETLs with high promise for fully&#8208;SP PSCs.

         <title>General Design Concepts for CAPodes as Ionologic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving are designed providing a generalized concept, resulting in a novel CAPode system with a high rectification ratio (RRII, 96.29&#8201;%) and an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;,&#8216;AND&#8217;). This work provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.







Abstract
Capacitive analogues of semiconductor diodes (CAPodes) present a new avenue for energy&#8208;efficient and nature&#8208;inspired next&#8208;generation computing devices. Here, we disclose the generalized concept for bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving. Controllable&#8208;unidirectional ion flux is realized by blocking electrolyte ions from entering sub&#8208;nanometer pores. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage characteristics with a high rectification ratio (96.29&#8201;%). The enhancement of capacitance is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of an omnisorbing carbon as counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement logic operations (&#8216;OR&#8217;, &#8216;AND&#8217;). This work demonstrates CAPodes as a generalized concept to achieve p&#8208;n and n&#8208;p analogue junctions based on selective ion electrosorption, provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.

         <title>Photoluminescence Anisotropy in Eutectic Crystals of Polynuclear Lanthanide Complexes and Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eutectic of Ag clusters and polynuclear lanthanide complexes induces fluorescence anisotropy. Investigation of the excitation polarization mechanism confirmed that the electrons in the ground state have higher transition efficiency when the direction of the electric field vibration of the photon and the direction of the molecular electric transition dipole moment are parallel.







Abstract
Anisotropy is an intrinsic property of crystalline materials. However, the photoluminescence anisotropy in eutectic crystals of organometallic complexes has remained unexplored. Herein, the eutectic of polynuclear lanthanide complexes and Ag clusters was prepared, and the crystal shows significant photoluminescence anisotropy. The polarization anisotropy of emission &#948; and degree of excitation polarization P are 2.62 and 0.53, respectively. The rare excitation polarization properties have been proved to be related to the regular arrangement of electric transition dipole moments of luminescent molecules in the crystal. Our design provides a reference for developing new photoluminescence anisotropy materials and expanding their applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stimuli Responsive Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli responsive microgels can be synthesized by a mechanochemical solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free synthesis route via a free&#8208;radical polymerization. The synthesized microgels exhibit excellent colloidal stability in aqueous media, and the size of the microgels can be modulated by controlling the crosslinker concentration in a ball mill.







Abstract
Mechanochemical approaches are widely used for the efficient, solvent&#8208;free synthesis of organic molecules, however their applicability to the synthesis of functional polymers has remained underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that mechanochemically triggered free&#8208;radical polymerization allows solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free syntheses of structurally and morphologically well&#8208;defined complex functional macromolecular architectures, namely stimuliresponsive microgels. The developed mechanochemical polymerization approach is applicable to a variety of monomers and allows synthesizing microgels with tunable chemical structure, variable size, controlled number of crosslinks and reactive functional end&#8208;groups.

         <title>Leveraging the Persistent Radical Effect in the Synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diaryl Dihydrobenzofurans

         <dc:description>
A simple, diastereoselective protocol for accessing trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaryl dihydrobenzofurans through efficient cross&#8208;coupling of persistent quinone radicals, derived from quinone methide dimers, and transient phenoxyl radicals is described. DFT calculations have provided insight into the reaction pathway. This transformation offers access to a wide variety of dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;containing natural products.







Abstract
A simple method for accessing trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaryl dihydrobenzofurans is reported. This approach leverages the equilibrium between quinone methide dimers and their persistent radicals. This equilibrium is disrupted by phenols that yield comparatively transient phenoxyl radicals, leading to cross&#8208;coupling between the persistent and transient radicals. The resultant quinone methides with pendant phenols rapidly cyclize to form dihydrobenzofurans (DHBs). This putative biomimetic access to dihydrobenzofurans provides superb functional group tolerance and a unified approach for the synthesis of resveratrol&#8208;based natural products.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Brushes Grown by Surface&#8208;Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization from Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;based Non&#8208;Covalent Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;immobilized, initiator&#8208;modified cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest complexes allow the growth of supramolecular brushes with thicknesses of &gt;100&#8197;nm via atom transfer radical polymerization. The non&#8208;covalent immobilization of the initiator also provides a facile route towards patterned polymer brushes via drop casting of an aqueous solution of an initiator&#8208;modified adamantane derivative onto a CB[7] functionalized substrate.







Abstract
Polymer brushes are densely grafted, chain end&#8208;tethered assemblies of polymers that can be produced via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. Typically, this is accomplished using initiators or chain transfer agents that are covalently attached to the substrate. This manuscript reports an alternative route towards polymer brushes, which involves the use of non&#8208;covalent cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest interactions to surface&#8208;immobilize initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization. These non&#8208;covalent initiators can be used for the surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of a variety of water&#8208;soluble methacrylate monomers to generate supramolecular polymer brushes with film thicknesses of more than 100&#8197;nm. The non&#8208;covalent nature of the initiator also allows facile access to patterned polymer brushes, which can be produced in straightforward fashion by drop&#8208;casting a solution of the initiator&#8208;modified guest molecules onto a substrate that presents the cucurbit[7]uril host.

         <title>Reprocessible Triketoenamine&#8208;Based Vitrimers with Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>

A triketoenamine&#8208;based dynamic covalent network was developed that is dual&#8208;recyclable: by mechanical reprocessing and chemically recycled in a closed loop. The work sheds light on the future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.







Abstract
Development of thermosets that can be repeatedly recycled via both chemical route (closed&#8208;loop) and thermo&#8208;mechanical process is attractive and remains an imperative task. In this work, we reported a triketoenamine based dynamic covalent network derived from 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol and secondary amines. The resulting triketoenamine based network does not have intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thus reducing its &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, lowering the stability of the tautomer structure, and enabling its dynamic feature. By virtue of the highly reversible bond exchange, this novel dynamic covalent bond enables the easy construction of highly crosslinked and chemically reprocessable networks from commercially available monomers. The as&#8208;made polymer monoliths exhibit high mechanical properties (tensile strength of 79.4&#8197;MPa and Young's modulus of 571.4&#8197;MPa) and can undergo a monomer&#8208;network&#8208;monomer (yields up to 90&#8201;%) recycling mediated by an aqueous solution, with the new&#8208;generation polymer capable of restoring the material strength to its original state. In addition, owing to its dynamic nature, a catalyst&#8208;free and low&#8208;temperature reprogrammable covalent adaptable network (vitrimer) was achieved. The design concept reported herein can be applied to the development of other novel vitrimers with high repressibility and recyclability, and sheds light on future design of sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Thin Films as Ideal Matrices for Azide Photolysis in Vacuum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the photo&#8208;mediated reactions of azides in well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;(Da&#8208;SBDC) SURMOF matrices using a solvent&#8208;free approach the initial formation of the nitrene intermediate is shown to be followed by an intramolecular amination yielding an indoloindole. This work offers a novel strategy for precisely controlled chemical transformations of matrix&#8208;isolated azides in crystalline surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs).







Abstract
Studies on reactions in solutions are often hampered by solvent effects. In addition, detailed investigation on kinetics is limited to the small temperature regime where the solvent is liquid. Here, we report the in situ spectroscopic observation of UV&#8208;induced photochemical reactions of aryl azides within a crystalline matrix in vacuum. The matrices are formed by attaching the reactive moieties to ditopic linkers, which are then assembled to yield metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs). These porous, crystalline frameworks are then used as model systems to study azide&#8208;related chemical processes under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, where solvent effects can be safely excluded and in a large temperature regime. Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) allowed us to monitor the photoreaction of azide in SURMOFs precisely. The in situ IRRAS data, in conjunction with XRD, MS, and XPS, reveal that illumination with UV light first leads to forming a nitrene intermediate. In the second step, an intramolecular rearrangement occurs, yielding an indoloindole derivative. These findings unveil a novel pathway for precisely studying azide&#8208;related chemical transformations. Reference experiments carried out for solvent&#8208;loaded SURMOFs reveal a huge diversity of other reaction schemes, thus highlighting the need for model systems studied under UHV conditions.

         <title>Instantaneous Free Radical Scavenging by CeO2 Nanoparticles Adjacent to the Fe&#8722;N4 Active Sites for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2 nanoparticles as radical scavengers are successfully anchored adjacent to the Fe&#8722;N4 active sites by a two&#8208;step metalorganic gaseous doping approach. Radicals generated at Fe&#8722;N4 sites can be instantaneously scavenged by adjacent CeO2. This greatly improves the scavenging rate of radicals by CeO2 and effectively mitigates the degradation of M&#8722;N molecules by radicals, thus improving the durability of the ORR catalyst.







Abstract
To achieve the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C materials with both high activity and durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the attack of free radicals on Fe&#8722;N4 sites must be overcome. Herein, we report a strategy to effectively eliminate radicals at the source to mitigate the degradation by anchoring CeO2 nanoparticles as radicals scavengers adjacent (Scaad&#8208;CeO2) to the Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Radicals such as &#8901;OH and HO2&#8901; that form at Fe&#8722;N4 sites can be instantaneously eliminated by adjacent CeO2, which shortens the survival time of radicals and the regional space of their damage. As a result, the CeO2 scavengers in Fe&#8722;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 achieved &#8764;80&#8201;% elimination of the radicals generated at the Fe&#8722;N4 sites. A fuel cell prepared with the Fe&#8722;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 showed a smaller peak power density decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles determined with US DOE PGM&#8208;relevant AST, increasing the decay of Fe&#8722;NCPhen from 69&#8201;% to 28&#8201;% decay.

         <title>Synthetic Peptide Antibodies as TNF&#8208;&#945; Inhibitors: Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels Neutralize the Inflammatory Activity of TNF&#8208;&#945; in THP&#8208;1 Derived Macrophages</title>

TNF&#8208;&#945; inhibitors, drugs based on monoclonal antibodies, are currently used to treat inflammatory diseases. Synthetic peptide antibodies based on molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP&#8208;NGs) can be promising alternatives. MIP&#8208;NGs neutralize biologically active TNF&#8208;&#945; secreted in the supernatant of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced human THP&#8208;1 derived macrophages. Consequently, TNF&#8208;&#945; cannot bind to its receptor, suppressing inflammatory responses.







Abstract
Tumor Necrosis Factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) is a cytokine that is normally produced by immune cells when fighting an infection. But, when too much TNF&#8208;&#945; is produced as in autoimmune diseases, this leads to unwanted and persistent inflammation. Anti&#8208;TNF&#8208;&#945; monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the therapy of these disorders by blocking TNF&#8208;&#945; and preventing its binding to TNF&#8208;&#945; receptors, thus suppressing the inflammation. Herein, we propose an alternative in the form of molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP&#8208;NGs). MIP&#8208;NGs are synthetic antibodies obtained by nanomoulding the 3&#8208;dimensional shape and chemical functionalities of a desired target in a synthetic polymer. Using an in&#8208;house developed in silico rational approach, epitope peptides of TNF&#8208;&#945; were generated and &#8216;synthetic peptide antibodies&#8217; were prepared. The resultant MIP&#8208;NGs bind the template peptide and recombinant TNF&#8208;&#945; with high affinity and selectivity, and can block the binding of TNF&#8208;&#945; to its receptor. Consequently they were applied to neutralize pro&#8208;inflammatory TNF&#8208;&#945; in the supernatant of human THP&#8208;1 macrophages, leading to a downregulation of the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. Our results suggest that MIP&#8208;NGs, which are thermally and biochemically more stable and easier to manufacture than antibodies, and cost&#8208;effective, are very promising as next generation TNF&#8208;&#945; inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Cleavage of Carbon Dioxide C=O Bond Promoted by Nickel&#8208;Boron Cooperativity in a PBP&#8208;Ni Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected reactivity promoted by the ability of the PBP ligand to cooperate with the metal center is observed after the insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8722;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe. The overall process involves a complex reaction with the participation of NiII/NiI/Ni0 species that ultimately results in the formation of a nickel cluster with butterfly structure.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of (tBuPBP)Ni(OAc) (5) by insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8722;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe (1) is presented. An unexpected CO2 cleavage process involving the formation of new B&#8722;O and Ni&#8722;CO bonds leads to the generation of a butterfly&#8208;structured tetra&#8208;nickel cluster (tBuPBOP)2Ni4(&#956;&#8208;CO)2 (6). Mechanistic investigation of this reaction indicates a reductive scission of CO2 by O&#8208;atom transfer to the boron atom via a cooperative nickel&#8208;boron mechanism. The CO2 activation reaction produces a three&#8208;coordinate (tBuP2BO)Ni&#8208;acyl intermediate (A) that leads to a (tBuP2BO)&#8722;NiI complex (B) via a likely radical pathway. The NiI species is trapped by treatment with the radical trap (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) to give (tBuP2BO)NiII(&#951;2&#8208;TEMPO) (7). Additionally, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis using 13C&#8208;enriched CO2 provides information about the species involved in the CO2 activation process.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of a Robustly Stabilized Folded State Enabling Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization under Microfluidic Mixing
</title>

         <dc:description>
Dimerization of the amino&#8208;acid&#8208;based diamide skeleton through a disulfide bond not only enhances the thermodynamic stability of the aggregated state, but also increases the kinetic stability of the metastable folded state. Accordingly, the initiation of the nucleation&#8208;growth supramolecular polymerization can be regulated using a seeding method even under microfluidic mixing conditions.







Abstract
We have investigated the folding and assembly behavior of a cystine&#8208;based dimeric diamide bearing pyrene units and solubilizing alkyl chains. In low&#8208;polarity solvents, it forms a 14&#8208;membered ring through double intramolecular hydrogen bonds between two diamide units. The spectroscopic studies revealed that the folded state is thermodynamically unstable and eventually transforms into more energetically stable helical supramolecular polymers that show an enhanced chiral excitonic coupling between the transition dipoles of the pyrene units. Importantly, compared to an alanine&#8208;based monomeric diamide, the dimeric diamide exhibits a superior kinetic stability in the metastable folded state, as well as an increased thermodynamic stability in the aggregated state. Accordingly, the initiation of supramolecular polymerization can be regulated using a seeding method even under microfluidic mixing conditions. Furthermore, taking advantage of a self&#8208;sorting behavior observed in a mixture of l&#8208;cysteine&#8208; and d&#8208;cysteine&#8208;based dimeric diamides, a two&#8208;step supramolecular polymerization was achieved by stepwise addition of the corresponding seeds.

         <title>A Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free Molecular Motif Based on Symmetric Bird&#8208;like Structured Tetraphenylenes with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) Afterglow over 8&#8201;s</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) afterglow of&gt;8&#8197;s without heavy atoms is realized in the rigid twisted structure TeP&#8722;F. The properly promoted electron&#8208;exchange with adequate spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhancement and the restricted molecular motions jointly give rise to the slow but efficient RTP emission, which is a great advantage over the heavy&#8208;atom RTP materials.







Abstract
In recent years, pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with highly efficient and long&#8208;persistent afterglow has drawn substantial awareness. Commonly, spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be improved by introducing heavy atoms into pure&#8208;organic molecules. However, this strategy will simultaneously increase the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition rate, further resulting in dramatic decreases in the excited state lifetime and afterglow duration. Here in this work, a highly symmetric bird&#8208;like structure tetraphenylene (TeP), and its three symmetrical halogenated derivatives (TeP&#8722;F, TeP&#8722;Cl and TeP&#8722;Br) are synthesized, while their RTP properties and mechanisms are systematically investigated by both theoretical and experimental approaches. As the results, the rigid, highly twisted conformation of TeP restricts the non&#8208;radiative processes of RTP and gives rise to the enhancement of electron&#8208;exchange, which can contribute to the RTP radiation process. Despite the faint RTP of the bromine and chlorine&#8208;substituted ones (TeP&#8722;Br, TeP&#8722;Cl), the fluoro&#8208;substituted TeP&#8722;F exhibited a long phosphorescent lifetime up to 890&#8197;ms, corresponding to an extremely long RTP afterglow over 8&#8197;s, which could be incorporated into the best series of non&#8208;heavy&#8208;atom RTP materials reported in previous literature.

         <title>Single&#8208;atom Iron Catalyst with Biomimetic Active Center to Accelerate Proton Spillover for Medical&#8208;level Electrosynthesis of H2O2 Disinfectant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>

An atomically dispersed iron catalyst with asymmetrical FeN3S1 moiety is developed to promote proton spillover kinetics toward medical&#8208;level electrosynthesis of H2O2 disinfectant.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of H2O2 has great potential for directly converting O2 into disinfectant, yet it is still a big challenge to develop effective electrocatalysts for medical&#8208;level H2O2 production. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of electrocatalysts with biomimetic active centers, consisting of single atomic iron asymmetrically coordinated with both nitrogen and sulfur, dispersed on hierarchically porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NS/C). The newly&#8208;developed FeSA&#8208;NS/C catalyst exhibited a high catalytic activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction to produce H2O2 at a high current of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a record high H2O2 selectivity of 90&#8201;%. An accumulated H2O2 concentration of 5.8&#8197;wt.% is obtained for the electrocatalysis process, which is sufficient for medical disinfection. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations verified the rationally&#8208;designed catalytic active center with the atomic Fe site stabilized by three&#8208;coordinated nitrogen atoms and one&#8208;sulfur atom (Fe&#8208;N3S&#8208;C). It was further found that the replacement of one N atom with S atom in the classical Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;C active center could induce an asymmetric charge distribution over N atoms surrounding the Fe reactive center to accelerate proton spillover for a rapid formation of the OOH* intermediate, thus speeding up the whole reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Water Self&#8208;Dissociation is Insensitive to Nanoscale Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio molecular simulations reveal that the free&#8208;energy barrier for water dissociation in nanoscopic domains, for instance a pore of 1.6&#8197;nm or a cluster of twelve water molecules, is the same as in the bulk solution. A rise in the barrier is only seen for subnanometer confinement, when the first solvation shell of the hydroxide and hydronium ions is affected.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement effects on water dissociation and reactivity remain controversial, despite their importance to understand the aqueous chemistry at interfaces, pores, or aerosols. The pKw in confined environments has been assessed from experiments and simulations in a few specific cases, leading to dissimilar conclusions. Here, with the use of carefully designed ab initio simulations, we demonstrate that the energetics of bulk water dissociation is conserved intact to unexpectedly small length&#8208;scales, down to aggregates of only a dozen molecules or pores of widths below 2&#8197;nm. The reason is that most of the free&#8208;energy involved in water autoionization comes from breaking the O&#8722;H covalent bond, which has a comparable barrier in the bulk liquid, in a small droplet of nanometer size, or in a nanopore in the absence of strong interfacial interactions. Thus, dissociation free&#8208;energy profiles in nanoscopic aggregates or in 2D slabs of 1&#8197;nm width reproduce the behavior corresponding to the bulk liquid, regardless of whether the corresponding nanophase is delimited by a solid or a gas interface. The present work provides a definite and fundamental description of the mechanism and thermodynamics of water dissociation at different scales with broader implications on reactivity and self&#8208;ionization at the air&#8208;liquid interface.

         <title>Divergent Stabilities of Tetravalent Cerium, Uranium, and Neptunium Imidophosphorane Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual redox properties of Ce, U, and Np in a homoleptic imidophosphorane ligand field include large cathodic shifts in the M4+/3+ (M=Ce, U, Np) couples and an unprecedented, well&#8208;behaved Np5+/4+ redox couple. This homoleptic ligand field, in effect, shifts the conventional redox stabilities of the mid&#8208;actinides to redefine the readily accessible oxidation states.







Abstract
The study of the redox chemistry of mid&#8208;actinides (U&#8722;Pu) has historically relied on cerium as a model, due to the accessibility of trivalent and tetravalent oxidation states for these ions. Recently, dramatic shifts of lanthanide 4+/3+ non&#8208;aqueous redox couples have been established within a homoleptic imidophosphorane ligand framework. Herein we extend the chemistry of the imidophosphorane ligand (NPC=[N=PtBu(pyrr)2]&#8722;; pyrr=pyrrolidinyl) to tetrahomoleptic NPC complexes of neptunium and cerium (1&#8208;M, 2&#8208;M, M=Np, Ce) and present comparative structural, electrochemical, and theoretical studies of these complexes. Large cathodic shifts in the M4+/3+ (M=Ce, U, Np) couples underpin the stabilization of higher metal oxidation states owing to the strongly donating nature of the NPC ligands, providing access to the U5+/4+, U6+/5+, and to an unprecedented, well&#8208;behaved Np5+/4+ redox couple. The differences in the chemical redox properties of the U vs. Ce and Np complexes are rationalized based on their redox potentials, degree of structural rearrangement upon reduction/oxidation, relative molecular orbital energies, and orbital composition analyses employing density functional theory.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Orbital Delocalization Enhances Charge Transfer in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study mainly analyzes the effect of the structure transition of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic semiconductors on the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the delocalization of the electron distribution in molecular orbitals induced by structure transitions can effectively improve the charge&#8208;transfer process and enhance the SERS activity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic semiconductors are promising materials for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;active substrates based on the tunability of electronic structures and molecular orbitals. Herein, we investigate the effect of the temperature&#8208;mediated resonance&#8208;structure transitions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS) films on the interactions between substrate and probe molecules, thereby affecting the SERS activity. Absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations show that this effect occurs mainly due to delocalization of the electron distribution in molecular orbitals, effectively promoting the charge transfer between the semiconductor and probe molecules. In this work, we investigate for the first time the effect of electron delocalization in molecular orbitals on SERS activity, which will provide new design ideas for the development of highly sensitive SERS substrates.

         <title>Li Plating Regulation on Fast&#8208;Charging Graphite Anodes by a Triglyme&#8208;LiNO3 Synergistic Electrolyte Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a strategy of Li plating regulation rather than Li plating inhibition. In this situation, Li plating on graphite has a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and a high reversibility. By effectively utilizing Li plating instead of suppressing it, it is possible to achieve a compatible pathway for fast charging of graphite anodes.

Graphite anodes are prone to dangerous Li plating during fast charging, but the difficulty to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step has made a challenging to eliminate Li plating thoroughly. Thus, the inherent thinking on inhibiting Li plating needs to be compromised. Herein, an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform Li&#8208;ion flux is constructed on graphite anode by introducing a triglyme (G3)&#8208;LiNO3 synergistic additive (GLN) to commercial carbonate electrolyte, for realizing a dendrite&#8208;free and highly&#8208;reversible Li plating under high rates. The cross&#8208;linked oligomeric ether and Li3N particles derived from the GLN greatly improve the stability of the SEI before and after Li plating and facilitate the uniform Li deposition. When 51&#8201;% of lithiation capacity is contributed from Li plating, the graphite anode in the electrolyte with 5 vol.% GLN achieved an average 99.6&#8201;% Li plating reversibility over 100&#8197;cycles. In addition, the 1.2&#8208;Ah LiFePO4 | graphite pouch cell with GLN&#8208;added electrolyte stably operated over 150&#8197;cycles at 3&#8197;C, firmly demonstrating the promise of GLN in commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries for fast&#8208;charging applications.

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a strategy of Li plating regulation rather than Li plating inhibition. In this situation, Li plating on graphite has a dendrite-free morphology and a high reversibility. By effectively utilizing Li plating instead of suppressing it, it is possible to achieve a compatible pathway for fast charging of graphite anodes.

         <title>Degradable, Ultraviolet&#8208;Crosslinked Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Adhesives Made from Thioester&#8208;Functional Acrylate Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives in commercial labels and sticky tape contain irreversibly crosslinked, insoluble, networks that hamper the recycling of cardboard and glass. This work establishes that degradable poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) networks featuring backbone thioesters have optimal adhesive properties and can be degraded on demand into fully soluble products.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are made from soft, irreversibly lightly crosslinked polymers. Even after removal from surfaces, they retain insoluble networks which pose problems during the recycling of glass and cardboard. Herein, degradable PSAs are presented that provide the required performance in use but have networks that can be degraded after use. A series of copolymers was prepared through radical copolymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate, 4&#8208;acryloyloxy benzophenone (ABP) photo&#8208;crosslinker, and dibenzo[c,e]oxepin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;thione (DOT) to provide degradable backbone thioesters. The optimum tack and peel strengths were found for molar contents of 0.05&#8197;mol% ABP and 0.25&#8197;mol% DOT. Degradation of the backbone thioesters through aminolysis or thiolysis led to the full dissolution of the networks, loss of adhesive properties of films (decreases in the measured tack and peel strengths), and the quick detachment of model labels from a substrate. Inclusion of DOT into PSAs offers a viable route toward degradable and recyclable packaging labels.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Reprogramming of Macrophages by Chiral Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanozymes were used as extracellularly localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generators to reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) by harnessing their chirality&#8208;dependent interactions with biological systems for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
It is known that extracellular free radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) rather than intracellular ROS plays a non&#8208;substitutable role in regulation of tumor&#8208;suppressing (M1) tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization. However, most therapeutic nanoplatforms mainly provide intracellular ROS and exhibit insufficient accumulation near TAMs, which strongly limits the macrophage&#8208;based immunotherapeutic effects. Here we design and synthesize chiral MoS2/CoS2 nanozymes with peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities to efficiently modulate TAMs polarization and reverse tumor immunosuppression by harnessing their chirality&#8208;specific interactions with biological systems. MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles coordinated with d&#8208;chirality (d&#8208;NPs, right&#8208;handed) show improved pharmacokinetics with longer circulating half&#8208;life and higher tumor accumulation compared with their l (left&#8208;handed)&#8208; and dl (racemate)&#8208;counterparts. Further, d&#8208;NPs can escape from macrophage uptake in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with the aid of cell&#8208;unpreferred opposite chirality and act as extracellular hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and oxygen (O2) generators to efficiently repolarize TAMs into M1 phenotype. On the contrary, l&#8208;NPs showed high cellular uptake due to chirality&#8208;driven homologous adhesion between l&#8208;NPs and macrophage membrane, leading to limited M1 polarization performance. As the first example for developing chiral nanozymes as extracellular&#8208;localized ROS generators to reprogram TAMs for cancer immunotherapy, this study opens an avenue for applications of chiral nanozymes in immunomodulation.

         <title>Adamantoid Scaffolds for Multiple Cargo Loading and Cellular Delivery as &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trioxaadamantanes derived from inositol orthoesters, containing three conjugatable sites, form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). Three drug molecules could be attached per adamantoid scaffold through enzyme&#8208;labile linkages and a successful drug delivery to HeLa cells as their &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion complexes was demonstrated.







Abstract
There is huge demand for developing guests that bind &#946;&#8208;CD and can conjugate multiple cargos for cellular delivery. We synthesized trioxaadamantane derivatives, which can conjugate up to three cargos per guest. 1H NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed these guests form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;CD with association constants in the order of 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Co&#8208;crystallization of &#946;&#8208;CD with guests yielded crystals of their 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes as determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In all cases, trioxaadamantane core is buried within the hydrophobic cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD and three hydroxyl groups are exposed outside. We established biocompatibility using representative candidate G4 and its inclusion complex with &#946;&#8208;CD (&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G4), by MTT assay using HeLa cells. We incubated HeLa cells with rhodamine&#8208;conjugated G4 and established cellular cargo delivery using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. For functional assay, we incubated HeLa cells with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;inclusion complexes of G4&#8208;derived prodrugs G6 and G7, containing one and three units of the antitumor drug (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;camptothecin, respectively. Cells incubated with &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 displayed the highest internalization and uniform distribution of camptothecin. &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7 showed higher cytotoxicity than G7, camptothecin, G6 and &#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G6, affirming the efficiency of adamantoid derivatives in high&#8208;density loading and cargo delivery.

         <title>Evidence for Carbene Intermediates in Isocyanide Homologation by Aluminium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the reaction between a neutral AlI complex (1) and isocyanides as Fischer&#8211;Tropsch model enables the isolation of diverse homologation products, including a pentamolecular coupling product (9). Through combined experimental and computational studies, a step&#8208;by&#8208;step mechanism involving carbenes as key intermediates has been elucidated.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation between C1 molecules plays an important role in chemistry as manifested by the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) process. Serving as models for the FT process, we report here the reactions between a neutral AlI complex (MeNacNac)Al (1, MeNacNac=HC[(CMe)(NDipp)]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and various isocyanides. The step&#8208;by&#8208;step coupling mechanism was studied in detail by low&#8208;temperature NMR monitoring, isotopic labeling, as well as quantum chemical calculations. Three different products were isolated in reaction of 1 with the sterically encumbered 2,6&#8208;bis(benzhydryl)&#8208;4&#8208;Me&#8208;phenyl isocyanide (BhpNC). These products substantiate carbene intermediates. The reaction between 1 and adamantyl isocyanide (AdNC) generated a trimerization product, and a corresponding carbene intermediate could be trapped in the form of a molybdenum(0) complex. Tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and even pentamerization products were isolated with the sterically less congested phenyl and p&#8208;methoxyphenyl isocyanides (PhNC and PMPNC) with concurrent construction of quinoline or indole heterocycles. Overall, this study provides evidence for carbene intermediates in FT&#8208;type chemistry of aluminium(I) and isocyanides.

&lt;p&gt;Exploiting the reaction between a neutral Al&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and isocyanides as Fischer&#8211;Tropsch model enables the isolation of diverse homologation products, including a pentamolecular coupling product (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;). Through combined experimental and computational studies, a step-by-step mechanism involving carbenes as key intermediates has been elucidated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C&#8722;C bond formation between C1 molecules plays an important role in chemistry as manifested by the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) process. Serving as models for the FT process, we report here the reactions between a neutral Al&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex (&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac)Al (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac=HC[(CMe)(NDipp)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Dipp=2,6-diisopropylphenyl) and various isocyanides. The step-by-step coupling mechanism was studied in detail by low-temperature NMR monitoring, isotopic labeling, as well as quantum chemical calculations. Three different products were isolated in reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with the sterically encumbered 2,6-bis(benzhydryl)-4-Me-phenyl isocyanide (BhpNC). These products substantiate carbene intermediates. The reaction between &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and adamantyl isocyanide (AdNC) generated a trimerization product, and a corresponding carbene intermediate could be trapped in the form of a molybdenum(0) complex. Tri-, tetra-, and even pentamerization products were isolated with the sterically less congested phenyl and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-methoxyphenyl isocyanides (PhNC and PMPNC) with concurrent construction of quinoline or indole heterocycles. Overall, this study provides evidence for carbene intermediates in FT-type chemistry of aluminium(I) and isocyanides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A large data set of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonds in N&#8208;haloimide&#8208;pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide complexes has been compiled from 132 DFT&#8208;optimized structures, 75 crystal structures, and 168 1H NMR titrations. This approach has led to unprecedented correlations being found between the DFT halogen bond interaction energies (E) derived from only three key parameters: the sigma&#8208;hole of the XB donor halogen, the atomic charge, and local ionization energies of the oxygen atom.







Abstract
N&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen&#8208;bonded systems formed by 27 pyridine N&#8208;oxides (PyNOs) as halogen&#8208;bond (XB) acceptors and two N&#8208;halosuccinimides, two N&#8208;halophthalimides, and two N&#8208;halosaccharins as XB donors are studied in silico, in solution, and in the solid state. This large set of data (132 DFT optimized structures, 75 crystal structures, and 168 1H NMR titrations) provides a unique view to structural and bonding properties. In the computational part, a simple electrostatic model (SiElMo) for predicting XB energies using only the properties of halogen donors and oxygen acceptors is developed. The SiElMo energies are in perfect accord with energies calculated from XB complexes optimized with two high&#8208;level DFT approaches. Data from in silico bond energies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures correlate; however, data from solution do not. The polydentate bonding characteristic of the PyNOs&#8217; oxygen atom in solution, as revealed by solid&#8208;state structures, is attributed to the lack of correlation between DFT/solid&#8208;state and solution data. XB strength is only slightly affected by the PyNO oxygen properties [(atomic charge (Q), ionization energy (Is,min) and local negative minima (Vs,min)], as the &#963;&#8208;hole (Vs,max) of the donor halogen is the key determinant leading to the sequence N&#8208;halosaccharin&gt;N&#8208;halosuccinimide&gt;N&#8208;halophthalimide on the XB strength.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Active Chiral Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts with Suppressed Charge Recombination</title>

We introduce aggregation&#8208;induced chirality in organic photovoltaic catalysts, which suppresses charge recombination by chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;polarization and improves photocatalytic activities by 60&#8211;70&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recombination of free charges in organic semiconductors reduces the available photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;carriers and restricts photovoltaic efficiency. In this work, the chiral organic semiconductors (Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S with enantiopure R&#8208; and S&#8208; chiral alkyl sidechains) are designed and synthesized, which show effective aggregation&#8208;induced chirality through mainchain packing with chiral conformations in non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups with tilt chirality. Based on the analysis of spin&#8208;injection, magnetic&#8208;hysteresis loop, and thermodynamics and dynamics of the excited state, we suggest that the aggregation&#8208;induced chirality can generate spin&#8208;polarization, which suppresses charge recombination and offers more available charge&#8208;carriers within Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S relative to the achiral counterpart (Y6). Then the chiral Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S show enhanced catalytic activity with optimal average hydrogen evolution rates of 205 and 217&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, 60&#8211;70&#8201;% higher than Y6, when they are employed as nanoparticle photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated solar light, AM1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

A facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy has been adopted to access highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs) with the in&#8208;situ installation of four cyano substitutents at room temperature. The TCDADIs feature a coplanar backbone, high electron affinity, and high crystallinity, which are a benefit for the electron&#8208;transport performance, with impressive electron mobilities of above 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 obtained.







Abstract
A family of novel highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyano&#8208;substituted acene diimides, named as tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs), have been synthesized using a facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy. Unlike conventional cyano substitution reactions, our approach enables access to a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone with the in&#8208;situ formation of four cyano substitutents at room temperature while avoiding extra cyano&#8208;functionalization reactions. TCDADIs decorated with different N&#8208;alkyl substituents present good solubility, near&#8208;coplanar backbones, good crystallinity, and low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of &#8722;4.33&#8197;eV, all of which contribute to desirable electron&#8208;transport performance when applied in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET). The highest electron mobility of an OFET based on a 2&#8208;hexyldecyl&#8208;substituted TCDADI single crystal reaches 12.6&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is not only among the highest values for the reported n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials (OSMs) but also exceeds that of most n&#8208;type OSMs decorated with imide units.

         <title>Twisted Diindeno&#8208;Fused Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene Derivatives and their Dianions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituents of different sizes have been used to synthesize diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity. The twisting of the neutral antiaromatic compounds led to them being endowed with chirality, as well as enhanced energy gaps with decreased diradical character. Furthermore, the doubly reduced species exhibited global aromaticity and decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity.







Abstract
We report a facile synthesis of diindeno&#8208;fused dibenzo[a,h]anthracene derivatives (DIDBA&#8208;2Cl, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph, and DIDBA&#8208;2H) with different degrees of non&#8208;planarity using three substituents (chloro, phenyl, and hydrogen) of various sizes. The planarization of their cores, as evidenced by the decreased end&#8208;to&#8208;end torsional angles, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their enhanced energy gaps with twisting were investigated by a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods with density functional theory, which showed a transition from singlet open&#8208;shell to closed&#8208;shell configuration. Moreover, their doubly reduced states, DIDBA&#8208;2Ph2&#8722; and DIDBA&#8208;2H2&#8722;, were achieved by chemical reduction. The structures of dianions were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which elucidated that the electron charging further distorted the backbones. The electronic structure of the dianions was demonstrated by experimental and theoretical approaches, suggesting decreased energy gaps with larger non&#8208;planarity, different from the neutral species.

         <title>Tryptophan in Multicomponent Petasis Reactions for Peptide Stapling and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;component peptide stapling is an appealing method for preparing enzymatically stable peptides with incorporated biologically relevant tags. An unprecedented approach, utilising the tryptophan&#8208;mediated multicomponent Petasis reaction (TMPR), facilitates the generation of stapled peptides and enables their late&#8208;stage functionalisation. A variety of examples are presented to highlight the advantages of the method.







Abstract
Peptide stapling is a robust strategy for generating enzymatically stable, macrocyclic peptides. The incorporation of biologically relevant tags (such as cell&#8208;penetrating motifs or fluorescent dyes) into peptides, while preserving their binding interactions and enhancing their stability, is highly sought after. Despite the unique opportunities offered by tryptophan&#8216;s indole scaffold for targeted functionalisation, its utilisation in peptide stapling has been limited as compared to other amino acids. Herein, we present an approach for peptide stapling using the tryptophan&#8208;mediated Petasis reaction. This method enables the synthesis of both stapled and labelled peptides and is applicable to both solution and solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Importantly, the use of the Petasis reaction in combination with tryptophan facilitates the formation of stapled peptides in a straightforward, multicomponent fashion, while circumventing the formation of undesired by&#8208;products. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient and diverse late&#8208;stage peptide modifications, thereby enabling rapid production of numerous conjugates for biological and medicinal applications.

         <title>Benzidine Derivatives: A Class of High Redox Potential Molecules for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines, a series of water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable high redox potentials (0.78&#8208;1.01&#8197;V vs. SHE) were obtained. The impressive battery performance based on N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraethylbenzidine pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte suggested that benzidine derivatives could be promising catholyte materials for aqueous organic flow batteries.







Abstract
The development of water&#8208;soluble redox&#8208;active molecules with high potentials is one of the effective ways to enhance the energy density of aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). Herein, a series of promising N&#8208;substituted benzidine analogues as water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable redox potentials (0.78&#8211;1.01&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) were obtained by the molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines. Theoretical calculations reveal that the redox potentials of these benzidine derivatives in acidic solution are determined by their electronic structure and alkalinity. Among these benzidine derivatives, N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraethylbenzidine(TEB) shows both high redox potential (0.82&#8197;V vs. SHE) and good solubility (1.1&#8197;M). Pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte, the cell displayed discharge capacity retention of 99.4&#8201;% per cycle and a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of &#8764;100&#8201;% over 1200&#8197;cycles. The stable discharge capacity of 41.8&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 was achieved at the 1.0&#8197;M TEB catholyte with a CE of 97.2&#8201;% and energy efficiency (EE) of 91.2&#8201;%, demonstrating that N&#8208;substituted benzidines could be promising for AOFBs.

         <title>Low Catalyst Loading Enhances Charge Accumulation for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation requires consecutive accumulation of charges at the catalytically active site. The active centers compete with each other in accumulating charges. The unexpected benefits of low&#8208;density catalyst loading in facilitating forward charge transfer for desired chemical reactions were revealed. It is implied that for practical solar water splitting devices, a suitable catalyst loading is important for optimized performance.







Abstract
Solar water oxidation is a critical step in artificial photosynthesis. Successful completion of the process requires four holes and releases four protons. It depends on the consecutive accumulation of charges at the active site. While recent research has shown an obvious dependence of the reaction kinetics on the hole concentrations on the surface of heterogeneous (photo)electrodes, little is known about how the catalyst density impacts the reaction rate. Using atomically dispersed Ir catalysts on hematite, we report a study on how the interplay between the catalyst density and the surface hole concentration influences the reaction kinetics. At low photon flux, where surface hole concentrations are low, faster charge transfer was observed on photoelectrodes with low catalyst density compared to high catalyst density; at high photon flux and high applied potentials, where surface hole concentrations are moderate or high, slower surface charge recombination was afforded by low&#8208;density catalysts. The results support that charge transfer between the light absorber and the catalyst is reversible; they reveal the unexpected benefits of low&#8208;density catalyst loading in facilitating forward charge transfer for desired chemical reactions. It is implied that for practical solar water splitting devices, a suitable catalyst loading is important for maximized performance.

         <title>Cooperative Bimetallic Catalysis via One&#8208;Metal/Two&#8208;Ligands: Mechanistic Insights of Polyfluoroarylation&#8208;Allylation of Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative bimetallic catalysis via one&#8208;metal/two&#8208;ligands in situ assembling is developed in geminal polyfluoroarylation&#8208;allylation of diazo esters, delivering products bearing a 1,1&#8242;&#8208;aryl, polyfluoroaryl quaternary carbon center. Detailed mechanistic investigation disclosed unique roles of two distinct ligands, suggesting two in situ formed Pd complexes display different reactivities and work cooperatively in two catalytic cycles.







Abstract
Metal/ligand in situ assembly is crucial for tailoring the reactivity &amp; selectivity in transition metal catalysis. Cooperative catalysis via a single metal/two ligands is still underdeveloped, since it is rather challenging to harness the distinct reactivity profiles of the species generated by self&#8208;assembly of a single metal precursor with a mixture of different ligands. Herein, we report a catalytic system composed of a single metal/two ligands for a three&#8208;component reaction of polyfluoroarene, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and allylic electrophile, leading to highly efficient construction of densely functionalized quaternary carbon centers, that are otherwise hardly accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest this reaction follows a cooperative bimetallic pathway via two catalysts with distinct reactivity profiles, which are assembled in situ from a single metal precursor and two ligands and work in concert to escort the transformation.

Herein, we report a catalytic system composed of a single metal/two ligands for a three-component reaction of polyfluoroarene, &#945;-diazo ester, and allylic electrophile, leading to highly efficient construction of densely functionalized quaternary carbon centers, that are otherwise hardly accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest this reaction follows a cooperative bimetallic pathway via two catalysts with distinct reactivity profiles, which are assembled in situ from a single metal precursor and two ligands and work in concert to escort the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Zn/Electrolyte Interphase and Enhanced Cation Transfer of Sol Electrolyte for All&#8208;Climate Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrathin nanosheets of zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive of aqueous zinc metal batteries. The nanosheets not only bring a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. The enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase remarkably improve the electrochemical performance of Zn||LiMn2O4 in all climates.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of the promising anodes of aqueous batteries possesses notable advantages, but it faces severe challenges from severe side reactions and notorious dendrite growth. Here, ultrathin nanosheets of &#945;&#8208;zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive. The nanosheets not only create a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. Benefited from the enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase, the pouch cells of Zn||LiMn2O4 using this electrolyte remarkably improve electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, i.e. Zn powders as the Zn anode, high mass loading, and wide temperatures. The results expand the materials available for this dynamic interphase, provide an insightful understanding of the enhanced charge transfer in the electrolyte, and realize the combination of dynamic interphase and enhanced kinetics for all&#8208;climate performance.

         <title>Photo Responsive Electron and Proton Conductivity within a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>

A donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) is constructed from zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as the acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8722;) as the donor. It exhibits photo&#8208;responsive electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer.







Abstract
Rational design of crystalline porous materials with coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer has not yet been reported to date. Herein, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) with zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8722;) as donor to form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layer. Three water molecules were situated in the channels to connect with acidic species through hydrogen bonding interactions to give a 3D framework. The continuous &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions along the a axis and the smooth H&#8208;bonding chain along the b axis provide the electron and proton transfer pathways, respectively. After 405&#8197;nm light irradiation, the photogenerated radicals could simultaneously endow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36 with photoswitchable electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer. By single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient absorption spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism of the switchable conductivity upon irradiation has been demonstrated.

         <title>Engaging Early&#8208;Career Scientists in Global Policy&#8208;Making</title>

         <dc:description>
Societal, political, and institutional barriers impede early&#8208;career scientists&#8217; engagement in evidence&#8208;informed policy&#8208;making to address societal challenges. Better training, recognition, and stakeholder reforms could raise awareness and involvement of scientists across disciplines in the policy&#8208;making process.







Abstract
Pressing global challenges, such as climate change, the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, or antibiotic resistance, require coordinated international responses guided by evidence&#8208;informed decisions. For this purpose, it is critical that scientists engage in providing insights during the decision&#8208;making process. However, the mechanisms for the engagement of scientists in policy&#8208;making are complex and vary internationally, which often poses significant challenges to their involvement. Herein, we address some of the mechanisms and barriers for scientists to engage in policy&#8208;making with a global perspective by early&#8208;career scientists. We highlight the importance of scientific academies, societies, universities, and early&#8208;career networks as stakeholders and how they can adapt their structures to actively contribute to shaping global policies, with representative examples from chemistry&#8208;related disciplines. We showcase the importance of raising awareness, providing resources and training, and leading discussions about connecting emerging scientists with global decision&#8208;makers to address societal challenges through policies.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Trinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Alkenes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>

Inert alkyl bromides are rarely used in photoinduced 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes due to their strong reduction potential and bond dissociation energy. In their Research Article (e202305121), Jin Xie and co&#8208;workers overcome the inherent redox potential limit of alkyl bromides and achieve 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation of different alkenes by using the inner single electron transfer mechanism of an excited trinuclear gold catalyst.

Mechanochemical approaches are widely used for the efficient, solvent&#8208;free synthesis of organic molecules, however their applicability to the synthesis of functional polymers has remained underexplored. In their Research Article (e202305783), Carsten Bolm, Andrij Pich, and co&#8208;workers developed a free&#8208;radical polymerization approach to mechanochemically synthesize structurally and morphologically well&#8208;defined complex functional macromolecular architectures, stimuli&#8208;responsive microgels, under solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free conditions.

The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machine (BAM) is essential for folding outer membrane proteins (OMPs) into the outer membrane (OM) of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Structures of BAM have been solved using X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryoEM, but the conformation of BAM in the highly crowded native OM remained unsolved. Using EPR spectroscopy of BAM in intact E. coli cells, the structure of BAM in situ has now been revealed in the Research Article (e202218783) by Sheena&#8197;E. Radford, Christos Pliotas et&#8197;al., both alone and in the presence of the antibacterial, darobactin B. Image: Jeroen Claus (Phospho Biomedical Animation).

Dispersing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids in stable colloids is critical for their availability and processibility. In their Communication (e202303280), Hang Xing et&#8197;al. report a crown ether surface coordination approach that enables the universal suspension of various MOF powders into immiscible polar and nonpolar solvents, exhibiting exceptional dispersibility without compromising the accessible voids. The crown ether&#8208;coated MOFs exhibit potential as effective phase&#8208;transfer catalysts and enable the fabrication of uniform membranes with improved performances.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Conversion in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents fundamental strategies to prepare photoactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and composite materials for diverse applications in photocatalytic water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and hydrogen peroxide evolution.







Abstract
Intensifying energy crises and severe environmental issues have led to the discovery of renewable energy sources, sustainable energy conversion, and storage technologies. Photocatalysis is a green technology that converts eco&#8208;friendly solar energy into high&#8208;energy chemicals. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous materials constructed by covalent bonds that show promising potential for converting solar energy into chemicals owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures, high crystallinity, and porosity. Herein, we highlight recent progress in the synthesis of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and their applications in water splitting, CO2 reduction, and H2O2 production. The challenges and future opportunities for the rational design of COFs for advanced photocatalysts are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;This review presents fundamental strategies to prepare photoactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and composite materials for diverse applications in photocatalytic water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and hydrogen peroxide evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensifying energy crises and severe environmental issues have led to the discovery of renewable energy sources, sustainable energy conversion, and storage technologies. Photocatalysis is a green technology that converts eco-friendly solar energy into high-energy chemicals. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous materials constructed by covalent bonds that show promising potential for converting solar energy into chemicals owing to their pre-designable structures, high crystallinity, and porosity. Herein, we highlight recent progress in the synthesis of COF-based photocatalysts and their applications in water splitting, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The challenges and future opportunities for the rational design of COFs for advanced photocatalysts are discussed. This Review is expected to promote further development of COFs toward photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Site Carbon&#8208;Supported Metal&#8208;Oxo Complexes in Heterogeneous Catalysis: Structure, Reactivity, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, single&#8208;site carbon&#8208;supported Mo(=O)2 catalysts, Carbon/MoO2, are prepared via the direct grafting of molecular MoO2 precursors onto various carbon supports. These catalysts are highly active, selective, stable, and recyclable. Here, we summarize the experimental and computational investigations of the structures, reaction scope, and mechanistic pathways of this catalytic system.







Abstract
When early transition metal complexes are molecularly grafted onto catalyst supports, well&#8208;defined, surface&#8208;bound species are created, which are highly active and selective single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts (SSHCs) for diverse chemical transformations. In this minireview, we analyze and summarize a less conventional type of SSHC in which molybdenum dioxo species are grafted onto unusual carbon&#8208;unsaturated scaffolds, such as activated carbon, reduced graphene oxide, and carbon nanohorns. The choice of earth&#8208;abundant, low&#8208;toxicity, versatile metal constituents, and various carbon supports illustrates &#8220;catalyst by design&#8221; principles and yields insights into new catalytic systems of both academic and technological interest. Here, we summarize experimental and computational investigations of the bonding, electronic structure, reaction scope, and mechanistic pathways of these unusual catalysts.

         <dc:description>
Constructing efficient catalysts for thermocatalysis of CO2 to valuable products has attracted wide attention, and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have become promising candidates owing to high efficiency and low cost. This review discusses CO2 conversion catalysed by noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs, such as conversion of CO2 to benzimidazoles, N&#8208;formamides, carboxylic acids, carbonic esters, or oxazolidinones.







Abstract
Thermocatalysis of CO2 into high valuable products is an efficient and green method for mitigating global warming and other environmental problems, of which Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 thermocatalysis, and many excellent researches have been published. Hence, this review focuses on the valuable products obtained from various CO2 conversion reactions catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs, such as cyclic carbonates, oxazolidinones, carboxylic acids, N&#8208;phenylformamide, methanol, ethanol, and methane. We classified these published references according to the types of products, and analyzed the methods for improving the catalytic efficiency of MOFs in CO2 reaction. The advantages of using noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOF catalysts for CO2 conversion were also discussed along the text. This review concludes with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this review will be helpful to readers and attract more scientists to join the topic of CO2 conversion.

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction through Water Structure Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fu, Wang, Zhang, Cort&#233;s, Liu and co&#8208;workers validated a new strategy to improve the performance of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction by introducing localized electric fields and tuning the water structure at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.







Abstract
In the past, the design of efficient electrocatalyst materials for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was mostly focused on tuning the adsorption properties of reaction intermediates. A recent breakthrough shows that the performance can be improved by manipulating water structure at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface using atomically localized electric fields. The new approach was realized by using IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites and led to a significantly accelerated water dissociation and an overall improved alkaline HER performance. Supported by extensive data from advanced modeling, characterization, and electrochemical measurements, the work delivers an intricate examination of the interaction between water molecules and the catalyst surface, thereby enriching our understanding of water dissociation kinetics and offering new insights to boost overall alkaline HER efficiency.

Single&#8208;atom catalysts, featuring atomically dispersed metals on solid carriers, offer limitless possibilities for new, sustainable transformations in the chemical sector. These materials bridge the gap between organometallic and nanoparticle catalysis and are opening exciting avenues for mimicking metalloenzymes. This Review summarizes the impressive progress and potential knowledge gaps in the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts hold the potential to significantly impact the chemical sector, pushing the boundaries of catalysis in new, uncharted directions. These materials, featuring isolated metal species ligated on solid supports, can exist in many coordination environments, all of which have shown important functions in specific transformations. Their emergence has also provided exciting opportunities for mimicking metalloenzymes and bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This Review outlines the impressive progress made in recent years regarding the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic synthesis. We also illustrate potential knowledge gaps in the search for more sustainable, earth&#8208;abundant single&#8208;atom catalysts for synthetic applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoparticles with Universal Dispersibility through Crown Ether Surface Coordination for Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis and Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crown ether surface coordination (CESC) approach enables the preparation of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles with universal dispersibility, enhanced colloidal stability, recyclability, and preserved porosity. The MOF&#8208;CEC particles can be instantaneously suspended in immiscible two&#8208;phase solvents as an effective phase&#8208;transfer catalyst and can be used to prepare various uniform membranes with enhanced adsorption and separation performance.







Abstract
Dispersing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) solids in stable colloids is crucial for their availability and processibility. Herein, we report a crown ether surface coordination approach for functionalizing the surface&#8208;exposed metal sites of MOF particles with amphiphilic carboxylated crown ether (CEC). The surface&#8208;bound crown ethers significantly improve MOF solvation without compromising the accessible voids. We demonstrate that CEC&#8208;coated MOFs exhibit exceptional colloidal dispersibility and stability in 11 distinct solvents and six polymer matrices with a wide range of polarities. The MOF&#8208;CEC can be instantaneously suspended in immiscible two&#8208;phase solvents as an effective phase&#8208;transfer catalyst and can form various uniform membranes with enhanced adsorption and separation performance, which highlights the effectiveness of crown ether coating.

The MOF-CE&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; can be instantaneously suspended in immiscible two-phase solvents as an effective phase-transfer catalyst and can form various uniform membranes with enhanced adsorption and separation performance, which highlights the effectiveness of crown ether coating.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Formal (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with Ketenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for the preparation of valuable bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes by Lewis acid catalyzed formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of readily available bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and ketenes is presented. Excellent tolerance towards functional groups and versatile substitution patterns in the 3&#8208;position of the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane core are demonstrated.







Abstract
Design, synthesis and application of benzene bioisosteres have attracted a lot of attention in the past 20&#8197;years. Recently, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have emerged as highly attractive bioisosteres for ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted benzenes. Herein we report a mild, scalable and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones through Lewis acid catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane ketones with disubstituted ketenes. The reaction shows high functional group tolerance as documented by the successful preparation of various 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl as well as 3,3&#8208;bisalkyl bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones (26&#8197;examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield). Postfunctionalization of the exocyclic ketone moiety is also demonstrated.

         <title>Anti&#8208;inflammatory Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for Colitis Treatment: Construction and In Vivo Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of bilirubin&#8208;attached glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles was constructed as a platform enabling identification of an anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicine. Direct in vivo screening of the nanoparticle library by oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicine capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms.







Abstract
Common medications for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have limited therapeutic efficacy and severe adverse effects. This underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively target inflamed sites in the gastrointestinal tract upon oral administration, exerting potent therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic effects. Here, we report the construction and in vivo therapeutic evaluation of a library of anti&#8208;inflammatory glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (designated GlyNPs) in a mouse model of IBD. The anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNP library was created by attaching bilirubin (BR) to a library of glycopolymers composed of random combinations of the five most naturally abundant sugars. Direct in vivo screening of 31&#8197;BR&#8208;attached anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNPs via oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate GlyNP capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms. These findings suggest that the BR&#8208;attached GlyNP library can be used as a platform to identify anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicines for various inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Catalytic Formal [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition of Aldehydes with Bicyclobutanes: Expedient Access to Polysubstituted 2&#8208;Oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>

Efficient BF3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of abundant and readily available aldehydes with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes for rapid access of polysubstituted 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes is reported.







Abstract
Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has attracted tremendous attention because they are playing an important role as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids in modern drug discovery. Here, we report a BF3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of aldehydes with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) to access polysubstituted 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. A new kind of BCB containing an acyl pyrazole group was invented, which not only significantly facilitates the reactions, but can also serve as a handle for diverse downstream transformations. Furthermore, aryl and vinyl epoxides can also be utilized as substrates which undergo cycloaddition with BCBs after in situ rearrangement to aldehydes. We anticipate that our results will promote access to challenging sp3&#8208;rich bicyclic frameworks and the exploration of BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of Ferrocene 1,3&#8208;Derivatives by Distal C&#8722;H Activation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although transition&#8208;metal catalysis has evolved as a powerful catalysis platform, its application in distal C&#8722;H functionalization of ferrocenes had not been addressed until recently. Here, a PdII/ mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid ligand&#8208;catalyzed distal C(3)&#8722;H functionalization of ferrocenes has been shown with the help of a removable directing group while going through a ferrocene appended 12&#8208;membered cyclic transition state.







Abstract
The third position of cyclopentadienyl ring of a monosubstituted ferrocene has remained as an inaccessible chemical space for direct functionalization. Until recently, functionalizing the C(3)&#8208;position while bypassing the predominantly active C(2)&#8208;position is the most challenging task. Herein, we report a distal C&#8722;H functionalization of monosubstituted ferrocenes using an easily removable directing group with precise site&#8208;selectivity, under a PdII/ mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino&#8208;acid ligand catalytic system. The robust synthetic protocol leads to the synthesis of ferrocene 1,3&#8208;derivatives with broad scope in olefins while functionalizing ferrocenyl methylamine in moderate to good yields via a highly strained ferrocene appended 12&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.

         <title>Group&#8208;Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (GTPISA) in Non&#8208;polar Media: An Organocatalyzed Route to Block Copolymer Nanoparticles at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles are designed by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly at room temperature in n&#8208;heptane. This novel polymerization method (GTPISA) opens new avenues to fabricate self&#8208;stabilized metal&#8208;free and sulphur&#8208;free nanoparticles in non&#8208;polar media for practical uses, e.g. as viscosity modifiers or as lubricants, while at the same time expanding the field of organic catalysis of polymerization.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&gt;50&#8201;&#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (GTPISA) in non&#8208;polar media (n&#8208;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis&#8208;benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non&#8208;polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non&#8208;soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self&#8208;assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non&#8208;polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non&#8208;polar environments.

&lt;p&gt;Methacrylate-based nanoparticles are designed by group transfer polymerization-induced self-assembly at room temperature in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-heptane. This novel polymerization method (GTPISA) opens new avenues to fabricate self-stabilized metal-free and sulphur-free nanoparticles in non-polar media for practical uses, e.g. as viscosity modifiers or as lubricants, while at the same time expanding the field of organic catalysis of polymerization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&amp;gt;50&#8201;&#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate-based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization-induced self-assembly (GTPISA) in non-polar media (&lt;i&gt;n-&lt;/i&gt;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1-methoxy-1-(trimethylsiloxy)-2-methylprop-1-ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis-benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well-defined metal-free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non-polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non-soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment.

         <title>Synthesis of Quaternary and Tertiary Carbon&#8208;Substituted Arenes by Lewis Base Promoted Site&#8208;Selective Coupling with Allylic Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a practical method for site&#8208;selective allylic coupling that allows the construction of N&#8208;heteroarenes containing benzylic quaternary and tertiary carbons from a wide variety of organodiboron reagents and aryl nitrile electrophiles. Transformations employ readily available reagents, are promoted by a Lewis base activator, and undergo aryl&#8208;C(sp3) bond formation in good yields and high &#947;&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
A practical method for the preparation of quaternary and tertiary allyl&#8208;substituted heteroarenes by site&#8208;selective couplings of heteroaryl nitriles and allylic nucleophiles is disclosed. Transformations utilize readily accessible stable reagents, proceed in the presence of a Lewis base activator, and undergo aryl&#8208;C(sp3) quaternary and tertiary carbon formation with high &#947;&#8208;selectivity (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 &#947;&#8201;:&#8201;&#945;).

         <title>Catalytic &#963;&#8208;Bond Annulation with Ambiphilic Organohalides Enabled by &#946;&#8208;X Elimination
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a &#963;&#8208;bond annulation strategy that combines strong bond activation via &#946;&#8208;heteroatom elimination and redox&#8208;neutral annulation along a PdII/PdIV redox manifold to access 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Various alkyl C(sp3)&#8722;O, N, and S bonds can be selectively activated, allowing for enantioenriched amino acid derivatives and low&#8208;strain heterocycles to be converted into value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
We describe a catalytic cascade sequence involving directed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation followed by &#946;&#8208;heteroatom elimination to generate a PdII(&#960;&#8208;alkene) intermediate that then undergoes redox&#8208;neutral annulation with an ambiphilic aryl halide to access 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)cycles. Various alkyl C(sp3)&#8722;oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur bonds can be selectively activated, and the annulation proceeds with high diastereoselectivity. The method enables modification of amino acids with good retention of enantiomeric excess, as well as &#963;&#8208;bond ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing transfiguration of low&#8208;strain heterocycles. Despite its mechanistic complexity, the method employs simple conditions and is operationally straightforward to perform.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Electrophiles with Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron catalyst achieves cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles wherein olefins, in the presence of a hydrosilane, are used in place of alkylmetal reagents to form alkyl&#8211;alkyl bonds. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of an alkyl radical from the alkyl electrophile, as well as with reversibility for some of the elementary steps that precede carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation.







Abstract
In terms of its abundance and its minimal toxicity, iron has advantages relative to other transition metals. Although alkyl&#8211;alkyl bond construction is central to organic synthesis, examples of iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl couplings of alkyl electrophiles are relatively sparse. Herein we report an iron catalyst that achieves cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles wherein olefins, in the presence of a hydrosilane, are used in place of alkylmetal reagents. Carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation proceeds at room temperature, and the method employs commercially available components (Fe(OAc)2, Xantphos, and Mg(OEt)2); interestingly, this set of reagents can be applied directly to a distinct hydrofunctionalization of olefins, hydroboration. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of an alkyl radical from the alkyl electrophile, as well as with reversibility for elementary steps that precede carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation (olefin binding to iron and &#946;&#8208;migratory insertion).

         <title>Robust Proton Conduction against Mechanical Stress in Flexible Free&#8208;Standing Membrane Composed of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricated a highly oriented free&#8208;standing membrane composed of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP) with excellent mechanical properties under stress. This is the first study to demonstrate the robust proton conduction of 2D CPs under an applied bending stress. We found that proton conductivity remained almost constant during bending.







Abstract
Introduction of mechanical flexibility into proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymers (CPs) is in high demand for future protonic applications such as fuel cells and hydrogen sensors. Although such mechanical properties have been primarily investigated in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) CPs, in this study, we successfully fabricated highly flexible free&#8208;standing CP membranes with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which is beneficial for enhanced performance in the aforementioned applications. We fabricated a layered CP, Cu2(NiTCPP) (H4(H2TCPP); 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin), in which a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) square grid sheet composed of tetradentate nickel porphyrins and paddlewheel&#8208;type copper dimers was connected to each other by weak van der Waals forces. The mechanical flexibility was evaluated by bending and tensile tests. The flexural and Young's moduli of the membrane were significantly higher than those of conventional Nafion membranes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the in&#8208;plane proton conductivity of the membrane was maintained even under applied bending stress. Because the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the proton&#8208;conducting pathway through the hydrogen bonding network remains intact during the bending operation, our present study provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of new and advanced 2D CPs without using substrates or additional polymers for protonic devices.

         <title>Bis(1&#8208;Methyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;Carboranyl)Borane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis superacidic secondary borane, bis(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (HBMeoCb2) has been synthesized and is demonstrated to be a very reactive hydroboration reagent. It can perform regioselective 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds, a unique 1,1&#8208;hydroboration for acetylenes featuring an aryl and silyl substituent, and the formal 1,3&#8208;hydroboration of cyclopropanes, all without the need of a catalyst.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid, bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane, is rapidly accessed in two steps. It is a very effective hydroboration reagent capable of B&#8722;H addition to alkenes, alkynes, and cyclopropanes. To date, this is the first identified Lewis superacidic secondary borane and most reactive neutral hydroboration reagent.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of the Oxidative Addition as a Way To Improve the Catalytic Efficiency of Pincer&#8208;Rhodium (I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular association of coronene and a pincer RhI complex of formula [Rh(CNC)(CO)]+ increases the electron&#8208;donating character of the pincer ligand. This results in a strong benefit to the catalytic performance of the complex towards the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid.







Abstract
1H NMR studies using a cationic complex with a pyridine&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene pincer ligand of formula [Rh(CNC)(CO)]+ revealed that this compound showed high binding affinity with coronene in CH2Cl2. The interaction between coronene and the planar RhI complex is established by means of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. This interaction has a strong impact on the electron&#8208;donating strength of the pincer CNC ligand, which is increased significantly, as demonstrated by the shifting of the &#957;(CO) stretching bands to lower frequencies. The addition of coronene increases the reaction rate of the nucleophilic attack of methyl iodide on the rhodium (I) pincer complex, and also has a positive effect on the performance of the complex as a catalyst in the cycloisomerization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. These findings highlight the importance of supramolecular interactions for tuning the reactivity and catalytic activity of square&#8208;planar metal complexes.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Zinc Diazoalkyl Complex: [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined zinc &#945;&#8208;diazoalkyl complex (3) was synthesized for the first time through the dehydrogenation reaction of trimethylsilyldiazomethane (Me3SiCHN2) with either a zinc(I)&#8208;zinc(I) bonded compound or a zinc(II) hydride. Notably, complex 3 selectively undergoes formal [3+2] cycloaddition with CO to generate complex 6 with a 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole core, reflecting an unprecedented CO reaction mode.







Abstract
This work reports the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of the first example of a well&#8208;defined zinc &#945;&#8208;diazoalkyl complex. Treatment of zinc(I)&#8208;zinc(I) bonded compound L2Zn2 [L=CH3C(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)CHC(CH3)(NCH2CH2PPh2)] or zinc(II) hydride LZnH with trimethylsilyldiazomethane affords zinc diazoalkyl complex LZnC(N2)SiMe3. This complex liberates N2 in the presence of a nickel catalyst to form an &#945;&#8208;zincated phosphorus ylide by reacting with the pendant phosphine. It selectively undergoes formal [3+2] cycloaddition with CO2 or CO to form the corresponding product with a five&#8208;membered heterocyclic core. Notably, the use of CO in such a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is unprecedented, reflecting a novel CO reaction mode.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Nonpolar C&#8722;C Bonds via &#960;&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Enabled Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed aromatization reaction of cyclohexadienol silyl ethers, which were readily prepared from cyclohexenones. The reaction was achieved through a cascade approach involving &#960;&#8208;coordination&#8208;enabled allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3)/C(sp2) bond cleavage. The generality of this strategy was shown by reacting a large array of cyclohexadienol ethers, including bicyclic&#8208; and spiro&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
Activation of C&#8722;C bonds allows editing of molecular skeletons, but methods for selective activation of nonpolar C&#8722;C bonds in the absence of a chelation effect or a driving force derived from opening of a strained ring are scarce. Herein, we report a method for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed activation of nonpolar C&#8722;C bonds of pro&#8208;aromatic compounds by means of &#960;&#8208;coordination&#8208;enabled aromatization. This method was effective for cleavage of C&#8722;C(alkyl) and C&#8722;C(aryl) bonds and for ring&#8208;opening of spirocyclic compounds, providing an array of benzene&#8208;ring&#8208;containing products. The isolation of a methyl ruthenium complex intermediate supports a mechanism involving ruthenium&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage.

         <title>Polymerizable Solvent&#8208;free Organic Liquids: A New Approach for Large Area Flexible and Foldable Luminescent Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polymerizable solvent&#8208;free organic liquid approach has been introduced to overcome the inherent limitations of organic liquid emitters. On&#8208;surface thermochemical polymerization of the hybrid liquids results in flexible and foldable large&#8208;area luminescent films. Our strategy is well suited for developing tunable and white light&#8208;emitting free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area flexible and transparent films suitable for futuristic applications.







Abstract
The high demand for light&#8208;emitting and display devices made luminescent organic materials as attractive candidates. Solvent&#8208;free organic liquids are one of the promising emitters among them due to the salient features. However, the inherent limitations of forming sticky and noncurable surfaces must be addressed to become an alternate emitter for large&#8208;area device applications. Herein, we functionalized solvent&#8208;free organic liquids having monomeric emission in bulk with polymerizable groups to improve the processability. The polymerizable group on carbazole, naphthalene monoimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free liquid emitters enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization. These emitters alone and in combinations can be directly coated on a glass substrate without the help of solvents. Subsequent photo or thermal polymerization leads to stable, non&#8208;sticky, flexible, foldable, and free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area films with reasonably high quantum yield. Our demonstration of the tunable and white light&#8208;emitting films using polymerizable solvent&#8208;free liquids might be a potential candidate in flexible/foldable/stretchable electronics. The new concept of polymerizable liquid can be extended to other functional features suitable for futuristic applications.

Solvent-free organic liquids are one of the promising emitters among them due to the salient features. However, the inherent limitations of forming sticky and noncurable surfaces must be addressed to become an alternate emitter for large-area device applications. Herein, we functionalized solvent-free organic liquids having monomeric emission in bulk with polymerizable groups to improve the processability. The polymerizable group on carbazole, naphthalene monoimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole-based solvent-free liquid emitters enabled on-surface polymerization. These emitters alone and in combinations can be directly coated on a glass substrate without the help of solvents. Subsequent photo or thermal polymerization leads to stable, non-sticky, flexible, foldable, and free-standing large-area films with reasonably high quantum yield. Our demonstration of the tunable and white light-emitting films using polymerizable solvent-free liquids might be a potential candidate in flexible/foldable/stretchable electronics. The new concept of polymerizable liquid can be extended to other functional features suitable for futuristic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Light&#8208;Enabled Access to &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Application in the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Allyl Boronic Esters
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Boryl radicals have reemerged as versatile intermediates to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. We disclose a facile activation of &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters using light and a Lewis base to permit homolytic scission. Addition to styrenes allows the construction of E&#8208;allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger with energy transfer catalysis to enable the stereodivergent synthesis of Z&#8208;isomers.







Abstract
Operationally simple strategies to assemble boron containing organic frameworks are highly enabling in organic synthesis. While conventional retrosynthetic logic has engendered many platforms focusing on the direct formation of C&#8722;B bonds, &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals have recently reemerged as versatile open&#8208;shell alternatives to access organoborons via adjacent C&#8722;C bond formation. Direct light&#8208;enabled &#945;&#8208;activation is currently contingent on photo&#8208; or transition metal&#8208;catalysis activation to efficiently generate radical species. Here, we disclose a facile activation of &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters using only visible light and a simple Lewis base to enable homolytic scission. Intermolecular addition to styrenes facilitates the rapid construction of highly versatile E&#8208;allylic boronic esters. The simplicity of activation permits the strategic merger of this construct with selective energy transfer catalysis to enable the complimentary stereodivergent synthesis of Z&#8208;allylic boronic esters.

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Migratory Allylation of Remote Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective migratory allylation of remote dienes via palladium&#8208;catalyzed simultaneous/directed chain walking is reported. The transformation provides a potential route to achieving stereoselective functionalization of multiple continuous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Chain walking has been an efficient route to realize the functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, but this strategy is limited to mono&#8208;olefin migration and functionalization. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of tandem directed simultaneous migrations of remote olefins and stereoselective allylation for the first time. The adoption of palladium hydride catalysis and secondary amine morpholine as solvent is critical for achieving high substrate compatibility and stereochemical control with this method. The protocol is also applicable to the functionalization of three vicinal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and thus construct three continuous stereocenters along a propylidene moiety via a short synthetic process. Preliminary mechanistic experiments corroborated the design of simultaneous walking of remote dienes.

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step method for highly enantioselective C3&#8208;allylation reactions of pyridines was developed. The method involved borane&#8208;catalyzed dearomative pyridine hydroboration, palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dearomatized intermediate, and finally oxidation by air. The method was applicable to a broad range of pyridines, N&#8208;heteroarenes, and allylic esters.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot method for enantioselective C&#8722;H allylation of pyridines at C3 via tandem borane and palladium catalysis. This method involves borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration to generate dihydropyridines, then palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allylation of the dihydropyridines with allylic esters, and finally air oxidation of the allylated dihydropyridines to afford the products. This method enables the introduction of an allylic group at C3 with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Molecular Design for High&#8208;Performance Molecular Diodes Based on Pyridyl Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving the positions of nitrogen atoms in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of phenylpyridyl&#8208;terminated isomers allows the coupling strength between the SAMs and the top electrode to be finely tuned from strong, to modest, to weak coupling. This results in the switching of the isomers from non&#8208;rectifying resistors (rectification ratios, r+=1 at &#177;1.5&#8197;V) to high&#8208;performance molecular diodes (r+=229).







Abstract
Better control of molecule&#8208;electrode coupling (&#915;) to minimize leakage current is an effective method to optimize the functionality of molecular diodes. Herein we embedded 5 isomers of phenypyridyl derivatives, each with an N atom placed at a different position, in two electrodes to fine&#8208;tune &#915; between self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the top electrode of EGaIn (eutectic Ga&#8722;In terminating in Ga2O3). Combined with electrical tunnelling results, characterizations of electronic structures, single&#8208;level model fittings, and DFT calculations, we found that the values of &#915; of SAMs formed by these isomers could be regulated by nearly 10&#8197;times, thereby contributing to the leakage current changing over about two orders of magnitude and switching the isomers from resistors to diodes with a rectification ratio (r+=|J(+1.5&#8197;V)/J(&#8722;1.5&#8197;V)|) exceeding 200. We demonstrated that the N atom placement can be chemically engineered to tune the resistive and rectifying properties of the molecular junctions, making it possible to convert molecular resistors into rectifiers. Our study provides fundamental insights into the role of isomerism in molecular electronics and offers a new avenue for designing functional molecular devices.

         <title>Oxidation of 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin: Its Generality and Novelty as an Oxaporphyrin Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin from the 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic neutral state into 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication state was achieved by blocking the reactive pyrrolic &#946;&#8208;positions with aryl groups. The dication was further converted into dipyrrindione by a ring&#8208;opening reaction, as also observed in the oxidation of verdoheme into biliverdin in the heme catabolism, thus consolidating the participation of an oxaporphyrinium cation species.

5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin (DOP) is a novel meso&#8208;oxaporphyrin analogue and exhibits unique 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromaticity, unlike its mother congener of 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin, commonly known as its cationic iron complex called verdohem, which is a key intermediate of heme catabolism. To reveal its reactivities and properties as an oxaporphyrin analogue, the oxidation of tetra&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylated DOP (DOP&#8208;Ar4) was explored in this study. Stepwise oxidation from the 20&#960;&#8208;electron neutral state was achieved, and the corresponding 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation and 18&#960;&#8208;electron dication were characterized. Further oxidation of the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication resulted in the formation of a ring&#8208;opened dipyrrindione product by hydrolysis. Considering a similar reaction of verdoheme to ring&#8208;opened biliverdin in the heme degradation in nature, the current result consolidates the ring&#8208;opening reactivity of oxaporphyrinium cation species.

&lt;p&gt;Conversion of 5,15-dioxaporphyrin from the 20&#960;-antiaromatic neutral state into 18&#960;-aromatic dication state was achieved by blocking the reactive pyrrolic &#946;-positions with aryl groups. The dication was further converted into dipyrrindione by a ring-opening reaction, as also observed in the oxidation of verdoheme into biliverdin in the heme catabolism, thus consolidating the participation of an oxaporphyrinium cation species.

         <title>Improved Birefringence Activated by Tetrahedra Decorated with a Single Linear Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve birefringence, namely decorating the tetrahedra with a single linear [S2] unit. Two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5 have been obtained. The introduction of the additional S atoms did not cause changes in the structure, but the optical anisotropy and birefringence were both enhanced greatly.







Abstract
Performance enhancement induced by structural modification has long been the target in materials science fields. Direct evidence to witness the effectivity of one strategy is challenging and necessary. In this work, a tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve the birefringent performance sharply, namely decorating the tetrahedra with a single linear [S2] unit. The strategy was verified by comprehensive characterization of two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5, which crystallize in the same space group, have similar unit cells and the same units arrangements. Theoretical characterization verified that the [GeS5] group has much larger polarization anisotropy than [GeS4], further demonstrated that the linear [S2] led to the sharp birefringence enlargement of K2BaGeS5 (0.19 vs 0.03 of K2BaGeS4). This work provides a new guiding thought to improve the birefringence performance.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution through Retarded Charge Trapping and Recombination by Continuously Distributed Defects in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defects is proposed to promote the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts for H2 evolution. The continuously distributed defects in the deliberately designed MAPbI3 photocatalysts retard charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance as confirmed by combined atomic force microscopy&#8208;based infrared and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopies.







Abstract
Inspired by its great success in the photovoltaic field, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) has recently been actively explored as photocatalysts in H2 evolution reactions. However, the practical application of MAPbI3 photocatalysts remains hampered by the intrinsically fast trapping and recombination of photogenerated charges. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defective areas to promote charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts. By deliberately designing and synthesizing the MAPbI3 photocatalysts featuring a unique continuation of defective areas, we demonstrate that such a feature enables retardation of charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance. As an outcome, such MAPbI3 photocatalysts turn out to achieve an impressive photocatalytic H2 evolution rate as high as 0.64&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, one order of magnitude higher than that of the conventional MAPbI3 photocatalysts. This work establishes a new paradigm for controlling charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photocatalysis.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Cyclopropenes under Lanthanocene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral lanthanocene complex served as a unique catalyst for the asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines, efficiently affording a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives in high yields with good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity and without the need for a directing group.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines is of much interest and importance, but has remained hardly explored to date probably because of the lack of suitable catalysts. We report here the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with phosphines by a chiral lanthanocene catalyst bearing the C2&#8208;symmetric 5,6&#8208;dioxy&#8208;4,7&#8208;trans&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindenyl ligands. This protocol offers a selective and efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives, featuring 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and no need for a directing group.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of an Anionic Diazoolefin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 34, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic diazoolefin was synthesized. It was found to display a distinct reactivity as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. Furthermore, it can act as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand for metal complexes.







Abstract
Bent (hetero)allenes such as carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes can act as neutral C&#8208;donor ligands, and diverse applications in coordination chemistry have been reported. N&#8208;Heterocyclic diazoolefins are heterocumulenes, which can function in a similar fashion as L&#8208;type ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the reactivity of an anionic diazoolefin. This compound displays distinct reactivity compared to neutral diazoolefins, as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. The anionic diazoolefin can be employed as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand in salt metathesis reactions with metal halide complexes. Extrusion of dinitrogen was observed in a reaction with PCl(NiPr2)2, resulting in a stable phosphinocarbene.

         <dc:description>Divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds starting from a suite of&#160;raw materials&#160;is an intriguing topic.&#160;Herein, we report the&#160;solvent&#8208;controlled&#160;rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tunable&#160;arylation&#160;of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene. The selection of the&#160;reaction solvents&#160;provides&#160;switchable&#160;defluorinated or debrominated&#160;arylation&#160;from readily available feedstock resources (both arylboronic acids/esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene&#160;are commercially available). This&#160;switch is&#160;feasible because&#160;of the difference in coordination ability between the&#160;solvent (CH2Cl2&#160;or&#160;CH3CN) and the rhodium center, resulting&#160;in&#160;&#160;different&#160;&#160;olefin insertion.&#160;This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, both of which are important scaffolds&#160;in&#160;the fields of medicine&#160;and materials.&#160;Moreover, this newly developed&#160;solvent&#8208;regulated reaction system&#160;can be applied to the site&#8208;selective&#160;dechlorinated arylation&#160;of trichloroethylene. Overall, this&#160;study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds and provides insight into&#160;the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Elastic Polymer Coated Nanoparticles with Fast Clearance for 19F MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful molecular imaging technique that enables high&#8208;resolution imaging of deep tissues without background signal interference. However, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) as 19F MRI probes has been limited by the immediate trapping and accumulation of stiff NPs, typically of around 100 nm in size, in the mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly in the liver. To address this issue, elastic nanomaterials have emerged as promising candidates for improving delivery efficacy in vivo. Nevertheless, the impact of elasticity on NP elimination has remained unclear due to the lack of suitable probes for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term monitoring. In this study, we present the development of perfluorocarbon&#8208;encapsulated polymer NPs as a novel 19F MRI contrast agent, with the aim of suppressing long&#8208;term accumulation. The polymer NPs have high elasticity and exhibit robust sensitivity in 19F MRI imaging. Importantly, our 19F MRI data demonstrate a gradual decline in the signal intensity of the polymer NPs after administration, which contrasts starkly with the behavior observed for stiff silica NPs. This innovative polymer&#8208;coated NP system represents a groundbreaking nanomaterial that successfully overcomes the challenges associated with long&#8208;term accumulation, while enabling tracking of biodistribution over extended periods.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Raman Lasing from Metal&#8208;Linked Organic Dimer Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulated Raman scattering offers an alternative strategy to explore continuous&#8208;wave (c.w.) organic lasers, which, however, still suffers from the limitation of inadequate Raman gain in organic material systems. Here we propose a metal linking approach to enhance the Raman gain of organic molecules. Self&#8208;assembled microcrystals of the metal linked organic dimers exhibit large Raman gain, therefore allowing for c.w. Raman lasing. Furthermore, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved in the organic dimer microcrystals by adjusting excitation wavelengths. This work advances the understanding of Raman gain in organic molecules, paving a way for the design of c.w. organic lasers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral QUINAP Derivatives by Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>QUINAPs have emerged as a pivotal class of axially chiral compounds with remarkable features in the stereoinduction of diverse enantioselective transformations. Despite their significant achievements, the confined substrate range and extravagant price still pose challenges, limiting their broader utilization. Herein, we have achieved the first atroposelective oxidation of N&#8208;atom using a chiral ketone catalyst. This innovative approach allows the kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs, resulting in both the unreacted substrates and their corresponding N&#8208;oxides with excellent enantiocontrol. Importantly, the enantioenriched products can be easily converted to the QUINAP targets without any loss of stereochemical integrity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that dioxirane, generated through the oxidation of ketone with oxone, acts as the active catalytic species. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this catalytic system to the kinetic resolution of QUINOLs and the dynamic kinetic transformation of pyridine analogs of QUINAPO possessing a labile stereogenic axis. The practicality of the developed protocol is further demonstrated by the successful application of QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide as a Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonodynamic Cytokine Nanocomplexes with Specific Stimulation towards Effector T cell for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytokine therapy mediates the interaction between immune cells and non&#8208;immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), forming a promising approach in cancer therapy. However, the dose&#8208;dependent adverse effects and non&#8208;selective stimulation of cytokines limit their clinical use. We herein report a sonodynamic cytokine nano&#8208;immunocomplex (SPNAI) that specifically activates effector T cells (Teffs) for antitumor immunotherapy. By conjugating anti&#8208;interleukin&#8208;2 (anti&#8208;IL&#8208;2) antibodies S4B6 on the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles to afford SPNA, this nanoantibody SPNA can bind with IL&#8208;2 to form SPNAI which can block the interaction between IL&#8208;2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), selectively activating Teffs in TME. Moreover, SPNAI generates 1O2 to trigger immunogenic cell death of cancer cells upon sono&#8208;irradiation, which promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the proliferation of Teffs. This SPNAI&#8208;mediated combination sonodynamic immunotherapy thus elevates the ratio of Teffs/Tregs in TME, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth, suppression of lung metastasis and prevention of tumor relapse.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Photoactivatable Protein with Genetically Encoded Photocaged Glutamic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genetically replacing an essential residue with the corresponding photocaged analogues via genetic code expansion (GCE) constitutes a useful and unique strategy to directly and effectively generate photoactivatable proteins. However, the application of this strategy is severely hampered by the limited number of encoded photocaged proteinogenic amino acids. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of photocaged glutamic acid analogues in E. coli and mammalian cells and demonstrate their use in constructing photoactivatable variants of various fluorescent proteins and SpyCatcher. We believe genetically encoded photocaged Glu would significantly promote the design and application of photoactivatable proteins in many areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium Bicarbonate Nanoparticles for Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy by Inducing Pyroptosis and Regulating Lactic Acid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although immunotherapy has a broad clinical application prospect, it is still hindered by low immune responses and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a simple and drug&#8208;free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs) are prepared via a fast microemulsion method for amplified cancer immunotherapy. The obtained alkalescent NaHCO3 regulates lactic acid metabolism through acid&#8208;base neutralization, so as to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor mildly acidic environment. Additionally, it can further release high amounts of Na+ ions inside tumor cells and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity, and thus to activate the pyroptosis pathway and immunogenic cell death (ICD), release a mass of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory factors, and improve immune responses. Collectively, NaHCO3 NPs observably inhibit primary/distal tumor growth and tumor metastasis through acid neutralization remitted immunosuppression and pyroptosis induced immune activation, showing an enhanced antitumor immunity efficiency. This work provides a new paradigm for lactic acid metabolism and pyroptosis mediated tumor treatment, which has a great potential to be applied in clinical tumor immunotherapy.</dc:description>
