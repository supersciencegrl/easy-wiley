         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Metal Electrocatalyst Powders and Electrodes and their Application for Oxygen Evolution and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited cata&#173;lytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We pro&#173;pose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique which can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi&#8208;metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were syn&#173;thesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and oper&#173;ando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are par&#173;ticipating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam&#8208;supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow&#8208;through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA&#8208;type electrolyzers reached up to 3 A cm&#8208;2, and 24 h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1 A&#183;cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Concentration Sulfolane&#8208;based Electrolyte for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is crucial for the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, lithium metal is stabilized in highly reactive sulfolane&#8208;based electrolyte under low concentration (0.25 M) for the first time. Inorganic&#8208;polymer hybrid SEI with high ionic conductivity, low bonding with lithium and high flexibility enables dense chunky lithium deposition and high plating/stripping efficiency. LCE also enables excellent cycling stability of NCM523/Li cells at 1 C (90.7% retention after 500 cycles) and 0.3 C (83.3% retention after 1000 cycles). With a low N/P ratio (~2), the capacity retention for NCM523/Li cells can achieve 94.3% after 100 cycles at 0.3 C. The exploring of the LCE is of paramount significance because it provides more possibilities of the lithium salts selection, especially reviving some lithium salts that are excluded before due to their low solubility. More importantly, LCE has the significant advantage of commercialization due to the cost effectiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework for Water Harvesting with Fast Kinetics and Low Regeneration Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atmospheric water harvesting represents a promising technique to address water stress. Advanced adsorbents have been rationally designed to achieve high water uptake, yet their water sorption kinetics and regeneration temperature greatly limit water production efficiency. Herein, we demonstrated that 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring hydrophobic skeleton, proper hydrophilic site density, and 1D open channels significantly lowered the water diffusion and desorption energy barrier. DHTA&#8208;Pa COF showed a high water uptake of 0.48 g/g at 30% R.H. with a remarkable adsorption rate of 0.72 L/Kg/h (298 K) and a desorption rate of 2.58 L/Kg/h (333 K). Moreover, more than 90% adsorbed water could be released within 20 min at 313 K. This kinetic performance surpassed the reported porous materials and boosted the efficiency for multiple water extraction cycles. It may shed light on the material design strategy to achieve high daily water production with low&#8208;energy input.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;backboned polymers with well&#8208;defined lengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing the backbone of polymers with metal atoms is an attractive strategy to develop new functional polymeric materials, but it has yet to be studied due to the synthesis challenge. Here, metal atoms are interconnected as the backbones of polymers to yield metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs). Rational design of multidentate ligands synthesized via an efficient iterative approach leads to the successful construction of a series of nickel&#8208;backboned polymers&#160;(NBPs) with well&#8208;defined lengths and up to 21 nickel atoms, whose structures are systematically confirmed. These NBPs exhibit strong and length&#8208;depended absorption with narrow bandgaps, offering promising applications in optoelectronic devices and semiconductors. We also demonstrate the high thermal stability and solution processability of such nickel&#8208;backboned polymers. Our results represent a new opportunity to design and synthesize a variety of new metal&#8208;backboned polymers for promising applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructing A Heterogeneous Layer on Lithium Metal Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and High Li&#8208;ion Flux</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing efficient artificial surface electrolyte interface (SEI) film is extremely vital for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, a dense artificial SEI film, in which lithiophilic Zn/LixZny are uniformly but nonconsecutively dispersed in the consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors of LixSiOy, Li2O and LiOH, is constructed via the in&#8208;situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets and Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors can promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of lithium ions, and lower the nucleation barrier. Therefore, a low polarization of ~50 mV for 750 h at 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2 in symmetric cells, and a high capacity retention of 99.2% in full cells with a high LFP areal loading of ~13 mg cm&#8208;2 are achieved. This work offers new sights to develop advanced alkali metal anodes for efficient energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Encapsulating C60 Fullerene into Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often limited by poor charge separation and slow charge transfer kinetics. Herein, a novel MOF photocatalyst is successfully constructed by encapsulating C60 into a nano&#8208;sized Zirconium&#8208;based MOF, NU&#8208;901. By virtue of host&#8208;guest interactions and uneven charge distribution, a substantial electrostatic potential difference is set&#8208;up in C60@NU&#8208;901. The direct consequence is a robust built&#8208;in electric field, which tends to be in C60@NU&#8208;901 10.7 times higher than that found in NU&#8208;901. Driven by it, photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated and transported to the surface. For example, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaches 22.3 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for C60@NU&#8208;901, which is among the highest values for MOFs. Our concept of enhancing charge separation by harnessing host&#8208;guest interactions constitutes a promising strategy to design photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Doyle&#8722;Kirmse Reaction of Azide&#8208;Ynamides via &#945;&#8208;Imino Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[2,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp3)&#8211;S and C&#8211;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction via azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggered functional dynamics of AsLOV2 by time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance at high magnetic fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present time&#8208;resolved Gd&#8208;Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240 GHz for tracking inter&#8208;residue distances during a protein&#8217;s mechanical cycle in solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN as spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin&#8208;7  /  2 EPR&#8208;active center, a short linker, a narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high magnetic fields (8.6 T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we are able to determine that upon light activation, the J  &#945;  &#8208;helix and N&#8208;terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1 s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60 s. TiGGER reveals that the light&#8208;activated longrange mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. Our results demonstrate that TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Difunctionalization of Sulfur Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free difunctionalization of bench&#8208;stable sulfur salts gives facile access to iodo&#8208;substituted sulfides using either diaryliodonium or vinyliodonium salts. The methodology was extended to one&#8208;pot syntheses of electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and efficient late&#8208;stage transformations of medicinally important compounds.







Abstract
Efficient protocols for accessing iodo&#8208;substituted diaryl and aryl(vinyl) sulfides have been developed using iodonium salts as reactive electrophilic arylation and vinylation reagents. The reactions take place under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, employing odorless and convenient sulfur reagents. A wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the S&#8208;diarylation, enabling the regioselective late&#8208;stage application of several heterocycles and drug molecules under mild reaction conditions. A novel S&#8208;difunctionalization pathway was discovered using vinyliodonium salts, which proceeds under additive&#8208;free reaction conditions and grants excellent stereoselectivity in the synthesis of aryl(vinyl) sulfides. A one&#8208;pot strategy combining transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free diarylation and subsequent reduction provided facile access to electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and a direct synthesis of a potential drug candidate derivative. The retained iodo group allows a wide array of further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic insights were elucidated by isolating the key intermediate, and the relevant energy profile was substantiated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Pure Isotropic Proton NMR Spectra in Solids using Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning provides a powerful and robust approach to remove broadening due to dipolar interactions in proton NMR spectra of solids.







Abstract
The resolution of proton solid&#8208;state NMR spectra is usually limited by broadening arising from dipolar interactions between spins. Magic&#8208;angle spinning alleviates this broadening by inducing coherent averaging. However, even the highest spinning rates experimentally accessible today are not able to completely remove dipolar interactions. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to determine pure isotropic proton spectra from a two&#8208;dimensional set of magic&#8208;angle spinning spectra acquired at different spinning rates. Applying the model to 8 organic solids yields high&#8208;resolution 1H solid&#8208;state NMR spectra with isotropic linewidths in the 50&#8211;400&#8197;Hz range.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom or Dual&#8208;Atom in TiO2 Nanosheet: Which is the Better Choice for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 active center in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favourable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier as compared with single&#8208;atom Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.







Abstract
As rising star materials, single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely reported in the electro&#8208;catalysis area. To answer the key question: single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts, which is better for electrocatalytic urea synthesis? we design two types of catalysts via a vacancy&#8208;anchorage strategy: single&#8208;atom Pd1&#8722;TiO2 and dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 nanosheets. An ultrahigh urea activity of 166.67&#8197;molurea&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h1 with the corresponding 22.54&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved over Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2, which is much higher than that of Pd1&#8722;TiO2. Various characterization including an in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and theoretical calculations demonstrate that dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 site in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favorable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier compared with Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.

         <title>The Highly Controlled and Efficient Polymerization of Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordinative chain transfer polymerization permits the controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene, currently the most important monomer for plastic production. The key to the combination of control, very high activity, and an excellent catalyst economy seems to be a Group 4 metal complex stabilized by only one bulky and strongly bound monoanionic ligand. NH+B&#8722;=N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylanilinium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate.







Abstract
The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene is a very attractive but challenging target. Herein we report on a Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization catalyst, which combines a high degree of control and very high activity in ethylene oligo&#8208; or polymerization with extremely high chain transfer agent (triethylaluminum) to catalyst ratios (catalyst economy). Our Zr catalyst is long living and temperature stable. The chain length of the polyethylene products increases over time under constant ethylene feed or until a certain volume of ethylene is completely consumed to reach the expected molecular weight. Very high activities are observed if the catalyst elongates 60&#8201;000 or more alkyl chains and the polydispersity of the strictly linear polyethylene materials obtained are very low. The key for the combination of high control and efficiency seems to be a catalyst stabilized by only one strongly bound monoanionic N&#8208;ligand.

&lt;p&gt;Coordinative chain transfer polymerization permits the controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene, currently the most important monomer for plastic production. The key to the combination of control, very high activity, and an excellent catalyst economy seems to be a Group 4 metal complex stabilized by only one bulky and strongly bound monoanionic ligand. NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=N,N&#8217;-dimethylanilinium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene is a very attractive but challenging target. Herein we report on a Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization catalyst, which combines a high degree of control and very high activity in ethylene oligo- or polymerization with extremely high chain transfer agent (triethylaluminum) to catalyst ratios (catalyst economy). Our Zr catalyst is long living and temperature stable. The chain length of the polyethylene products increases over time under constant ethylene feed or until a certain volume of ethylene is completely consumed to reach the expected molecular weight. Very high activities are observed if the catalyst elongates 60&#8201;000 or more alkyl chains and the polydispersity of the strictly linear polyethylene materials obtained are very low. The key for the combination of high control and efficiency seems to be a catalyst stabilized by only one strongly bound monoanionic N-ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Surfactant&#8208;Polyoxovanadate Soft Materials as Tuneable Vanadium Oxide&#160;Cathode Precursors for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mixing of [V10O28]6&#8211; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant ( gem ) leads to the spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of surfactant&#8208;templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge&#8208;like V2O5 ( gem&#8208;V2O5). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V2O5 consisting of very small crystallites ( TBA&#8208;V2O5). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium&#8208;ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long&#8208;range microstructure of the  gem&#8208;V2O5 cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than  TBA&#8208;V2O5. The smaller crystallite size, and higher surface area, of  TBA&#8208;V2O5 enables faster lithium insertion kinetics and superior rate performance than  gem&#8208;V2O5.</dc:description>

         <title>Safer Polyurethane Foams with Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyurethanes (PUs) are a class of materials classically synthesized from isocyanates, diols, and water. Water is essential for producing carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used for self&#8208;blowing the foams. Due to safety concerns with the production of isocyanates, alternative chemistries have been evaluated and cyclic carbonate systems have shown great promise. In a recent advancement by Bourguignon, Grignard, and Detrembleur, a cyclic carbonate and diamine system is capable of generating CO2 for self&#8208;blowing through hydrolysis of the carbonate&#8208;based monomer. The authors demonstrate that with a simple variation of the diamine monomer a wide range of physical and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties were achievable. This work represents a significant step towards safer and more environmentally friendly PUs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protocol for the generation of allylmagnesium reagents from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes was developed using magnesium hydride (MgH2) that is generated&#160;in situ&#160;by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride (NaH) and magnesium iodide (MgI2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds or alkyl (pseudo)halides delivers branched products having an allylic quaternary carbon center, whereas that with chlorosilanes resulted in formation of linear allylsilanes in regio and stereoselective manners. Further derivatizations of the homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetramine Aspect Ratio and Flexibility Determine Framework Symmetry for Zn8L6 Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We derive design principles for the assembly of rectangular tetramines into Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubic coordination cages. Because of the rectangular, as opposed to square, geometry of the ligand panels, and the possibility of either &#916; or &#923; handedness of each metal center at the eight corners of the pseudo&#8208;cube, many different cage diastereomers are possible. Each of the six tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponents investigated in this work assembled with zinc(II) and 2&#8208;formylpyridine in acetonitrile into a single Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cube diastereomer, however. Each product corresponded to one of four diastereomeric configurations, with T, Th, S6 or D3 symmetry. The preferred diastereomer for a given tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponent was shown to be dependent on its aspect ratio and conformational flexibility. Analysis of computationally modeled individual faces or whole pseudo&#8208;cubes provided insight as to why the observed diastereomers were favored.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the observation of cis&#8208;HPPH, trans&#8208;HPPH, and PPH2 among the respective laser photolysis products of phosphine (PH3) and diphosphine (P2H4) in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10 K. The identification of these P2H2 isomers with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy is supported by D&#8208;isotope labeling and the quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;F12 level using configuration&#8208;selective vibrational configuration interaction theory (VCI). Bonding analyses suggest that the two conformers of HPPH contain standard PP double bonds, whereas, PPH2 resembles P2 in having partial PP triple bond due to the H2P&#8592;P &#960; bonding interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Textured Zinc Metal Anodes through Regulating Electrodeposition Current for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as&#8208;deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current-controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low-cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as-deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80 mA cm-2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)-textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn-based oxide cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monitoring Photoinduced Interparticle Chemical Communication In&#8208;situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring interparticle chemical communication plays critical role in the nanomaterial synthesis as this communication controls the final structure and stability of global nanoparticles (NPs). Yet most ensemble analytical techniques, which can only reveal average macroscopic information, are unable to elucidate NP&#8208;to&#8208;NP interactions. Here, we use stochastic collision electrochemistry to track the morphology transformation of Ag NPs in photochemical process at the single NP level. By further statistical analysis of time&#8208;resolved current transients, we quantitatively determine the dynamic chemical potential difference and interparticle communication between populations of large and small Ag NPs. The high sensitivity of stochastic collision electrochemistry enables the in&#8208;situ investigation of chemical communication&#8208;dependent transformation kinetics of NPs in photochemical process, shedding light on material design.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Microporosity in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) are a novel class of porous materials that cover a wide range of organic&#8208;based molecular building blocks connected through weak supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, p&#8208;p stacking, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Despite of their diverse chemical and structural nature, common features to POMMs include solution processability, crystallinity and microporosity. Herein, we focus, for the first time, on the advance of the field of POMMs beyond the archetypical microporosity. In particular, we highlight relevant examples of meso&#8208; and macroporous POMMs, as well as hierchachical ones (micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;, micro&#8208;/macro&#8208; and meso&#8208;/macroporous). We also remark some of their unique properties, and how they can be key in many applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Reactive Hydrocarbon Soluble Alkylsodium Reagents for Benzylic Aroylation of Toluenes using Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deaggregating the alkyl sodium NaCH2SiMe3&#160;with polydentate nitrogen ligands enables the preparation and characterisation of new, hydrocarbon soluble chelated alkylsodium reagents. Equipped with significantly enhanced metalating power over their organolithium counterparts, these systems can promote controlled sodiation of weakly acidic&#160;benzylic C&#8211;H bonds from a series of toluene derivatives under mild stoichiometric conditions. This has been&#160;demonstrated through the benzylic aroylation of toluenes with Weinreb amides, that delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;arylacetophenones in good to excellent yields. Success in isolating and determining the structures of key organometallic intermediates has provided useful mechanistic insight into these new sodium&#8208;mediated transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Technological Pathways to Produce Compressed and Highly Pure Hydrogen from Solar Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2) produced from renewables will have a growing impact on the global energy dynamics towards sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral standards. The share of green H2 is still too low to meet the net&#8208;zero target, while the demand for high&#8208;quality hydrogen continues to rise. These factors amplify the need for economically viable H2 generation technologies. The present article aims at evaluating the existing technologies for high&#8208;quality H2 production based on solar energy. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal reactors and plasma conversion utilize solar power directly or indirectly (as carbon&#8208;neutral electrons) and are reviewed from the prospective of their current development level, technical limitations and future potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Modified Poly(vinyl Alcohol)s and Their Degradation Using an Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water&#8208;soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical&#8208;chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a general and selective nanostructured cobalt catalyst for the hydrogenation of benzofurans, indoles and benzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first selective hydrogenation of benzofurans in the presence of a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal catalyst is reported. The developed optimal catalytic material consists of cobalt&#8208;cobalt oxide core&#8208;shell nanoparticles supported on silica, which has been prepared by the immobilization and pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid complex on silica under argon at 800 &#176;C. This novel catalyst allows for the selective hydrogenation of simple and functionalized benzofurans to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans as well as related heterocycles. The versatility of the reported protocol is showcased by the reduction of selected drugs and deuteration of heterocycles. Further, the stability, recycling, and reusability of the Co&#8208;nanocatalyst are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Mixed&#8208;Linker Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Switchable Semiconductive Characteristics for Tailorable Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), with diverse metal nodes and designable organic linkers, offer unique opportunities for the rational engineering of semiconducting properties. In this work, we report a mixed&#8208;linker conductive MOF system with both tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) moieties, which allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and semiconductive characteristics. By continuously increasing the molar ratio between tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene), the switching of the semiconducting behaviors from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type was observed along with an increase in electrical conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude (from 2.88 &#215; 10&#8722;7 S m&#8722;1 to 9.26 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S m&#8722;1). Furthermore, mixed&#8208;linker MOFs were applied for the chemiresistive detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), where the sensing performance was modulated by the corresponding linker ratios, showing synergistic and nonlinear modulation effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Chiral Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutanes Enabled by Enantioconvergent Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling of Cyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic substitution of readily available dichlorocyclobutenones and subsequent enantioconvergent Negishi coupling afforded 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted cyclobutenones. Further structural elaborations provided a group of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes with different stereochemical classes.







Abstract
Cyclobutenones provide a straightforward four&#8208;carbon ring platform for further structural elaborations in that every carbon atom of the ring could be potentially functionalized. We report here a nickel catalyzed enantioconvergent Negishi coupling of 4&#8208;iodocyclobutenones with an array of aryl or alkenyl zinc reagents to access enantioenriched 4&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones, from which a modular approach to the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes was demonstrated.

         <title>Chloroacetamide&#8208;Modified Nucleotide and RNA for Bioconjugations and Cross&#8208;Linking with RNA&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified nucleotide for construction of reactive RNA probes that form covalent cross&#8208;linked conjugates with Cys&#8208; or His&#8208;containing peptides and proteins is reported. The nucleotide and probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.







Abstract
Reactive RNA probes are useful for studying and identifying RNA&#8208;binding proteins. To that end, we designed and synthesized chloroacetamide&#8208;linked 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;ATP which was a good substrate for T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription assay to synthesize reactive RNA probes bearing one or several reactive modifications. Modified RNA probes reacted with thiol&#8208;containing molecules as well as with cysteine&#8208; or histidine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable covalent products. They also reacted selectively with RNA&#8208;binding proteins to form cross&#8208;linked conjugates in high conversions thanks to proximity effect. Our modified nucleotide and RNA probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Fluorescence from Carbon Dots Widely Tunable from Blue to Deep Red through Surface Ligand Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state fluorescent (SSF) carbon dots (CDs) with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained through surface ligand modulation. The emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering the conjugation ability between substituent ligands and carbon core. The developed SSF CDs showed great potential for widespread use in three&#8208;dimensional printing and various types of optical displays.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) find widespread attention due to their remarkable fluorescent and electronic properties. However, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching currently limits the application of CDs in colored displays. The construction of CDs with color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) is rarely reported, since the preparation of SSF CDs is technically challenging. Herein, through surface ligand modulation, SSF CDs with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained. In&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property studies reveal that intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding inside SSF CDs provokes the emission properties in the aggregated state. Photodynamic characterizations demonstrate emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering conjugation ability between substituent ligands and CDs core. Three&#8208;dimensional printing patterning is used to create a range of emissive objects, demonstrating the commercial potential for use in optical lamps.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Epoxidation and Aziridination of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes via Palladium Catalyzed &#963;&#8208;Bond Nucleopalladation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strained spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines were synthesized via three&#8208;component coupling between in situ generated 1&#8208;lithio bicyclo[1.1.0]butane, a broad variety of ketones, aldehydes and N&#8208;tosyl imines, and aryl triflates. The key step involves a highly diastereoselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxyarylation (or aminoarylation) of bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinolate intermediates.







Abstract
The development of preparative methods for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbocycles is gaining increasing importance due to the widespread utility of cyclic compounds in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report the development of a new methodology for the production of spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines containing a cyclobutane motif. In a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process, a bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl sulfoxide is lithiated and added to a ketone, aldehyde or imine, and the resulting intermediate is cross&#8208;coupled with an aryl triflate through C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxy&#8208; or aminopalladation with concomitant epoxide or aziridine formation. After careful optimization, a remarkably efficient reaction was conceived that tolerated a broad variety of both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. Lastly, through several high yielding ring&#8208;opening reactions, we demonstrated the excellent applicability of the products as modular building blocks for the introduction of three&#8208;dimensional structures into target molecules.

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven prodrug photoactivation is highly desirable for applications such as neuromodulation, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. Herein, via triplet fusion, we report on the far red&#8208;light driven photo&#8208;release of an anti&#8208;cancer drug by coupling the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizers with a photocleavable perylene&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer drug. Notably, this metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) strategy can be further advanced when incorporating additional functional dopant (i.e., immunotherapy medicine indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor) and the far&#8208;red responsive triplet fusion pairs in an air&#8208;stable nanoparticle. In this way, we observed efficient inhibition of primary and distant tumors in the mouse model with this IDO inhibitor&#8208;assisted TFP system at record&#8208;low excitation power compared to other photo&#8208;assisted immunotherapy approaches. This metal&#8208;free TFP strategy will spur advancement in photonics and biophotonics fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Folding&#8208;Induced Promotion of Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfers via Proximal Base for Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally flexible, bipyridine&#8208;containing Ru macrocyles have shown a remarkable increase in turnover per Ru center in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Conformational studies in the solid state revealed an increased tendency of the auxiliary base close to the active centers of the larger complexes to undergo intramolecular folding and preorganization, which facilitates proton abstraction in the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) processes play a key role in biocatalytic energy conversion and storage, for example, photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation. Here, we report a series of bipyridine&#8208;containing di&#8208; to tetranuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles 2&#8201;C&#8211;4&#8201;C (bda: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) to promote O&#8722;O bond formation. In photocatalytic water oxidation under neutral conditions, all complexes 2&#8201;C&#8211;4&#8201;C prevail in a folded conformation that support the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway with remarkable turnover frequencies of up to 15.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 per Ru unit respectively. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed an increased tendency for intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and preorganization of the proximal bases close to the active centers for the larger macrocycles. H/D kinetic isotope effect studies and electrochemical data demonstrate the key role of the proximal bipyridines as proton acceptors in lowering the activation barrier for the crucial nucleophilic attack of H2O in the WNA mechanism.

         <title>Computing Arithmetic Functions Using Immobilised Enzymatic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes immobilised in hydrogel beads and compartmentalised in a continuous tank reactor were shown to serve as a novel modular and reusable platform for molecular information processing. With small molecules (peptide&#8208;based substrates and inhibitors) as inputs, the robustness of the platform in performing the fundamental arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication was demonstrated.







Abstract
Living systems use enzymatic reaction networks to process biochemical information and make decisions in response to external or internal stimuli. Herein, we present a modular and reusable platform for molecular information processing using enzymes immobilised in hydrogel beads and compartmentalised in a continuous stirred tank reactor. We demonstrate how this setup allows us to perform simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction and multiplication, using various concentrations of substrates or inhibitors as inputs and the production of a fluorescent molecule as the readout.

         <title>Recent Applications of Trifluoromethanesulfonic Anhydride in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tf2O has been widely used in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progresses of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles, and nitro groups for the development of new reactions, and as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagents in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride has been widely used in synthetic organic chemistry, not only for the conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing compounds to the triflates, but also for the electrophilic activation and further conversion of amides, sulfoxides, and phosphorus oxides. In recent years, the utilization of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles and nitro groups has become a promising tool for the development of new valuable methods with considerable success. In addition, Tf2O has been used as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagent due to the contained SO2CF3 fragment, and significant progress has been made in this area. This review summarizes the recent progress in the applications of Tf2O in the above two aspects, and aims to illustrate the role and potential application of this reagent in organic synthesis.

         <title>The First Synthesis of Subporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free base subporphyrin, also called subporphyrin can be seen as a contracted porphyrin analogue. Despite its postulated importance, its study was limited by a challenging synthesis while the first isolation of boron(III) subporphyrins was accomplished about 15&#8197;years ago. In a recent report, Kim, Osuka, and Song successfully met this challenge. This seminal work will hopefully pave the road to rich chemistries and applications in materials science.







Abstract
Because of the rich coordination chemistry and unique optical and electrochemical properties, porphyrin analogues have been intensively investigated. Among them, subporphyrins have been long&#8208;awaited molecules, with only their boron complexes known to date because of the crucial role of the central boron atom as a template in synthesis. The challenges related to the synthesis of a genuine subporphyrin (boron&#8208;free) have finally been met and reported in a recent article from Kim, Osuka, and Song. A key strategy of their synthesis lies in the introduction of an exocyclic double bond at the meso&#8208;position and subsequent reduction to obtain macrocyclic conjugation. Considering the fact that the development of porphyrin chemistry is ultimately linked to the availability of free base porphyrins, this seminal work will facilitate studies on coordination chemistry and applications in materials science.

         <title>A Highly Stable, Capacity Dense Carboxylate Viologen Anolyte towards Long&#8208;Duration Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboxylate functionalized viologen is developed as a capacity dense, highly stable anolyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries up to 50&#8197;days of stable cycling.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have received increasing attention as an emergent battery technology for grid&#8208;scale renewable energy storage. However, physicochemical properties of redox&#8208;active organic electrolytes remain fine refinement to maximize their performance in RFBs. Herein, we report a carboxylate functionalized viologen derivative, N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibutyrate&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium, (CBu)2V, as a highly stable, high capacity anolyte material under near pH neutral conditions. (CBu)2V can achieve solubility of 2.1&#8197;M and display a reversible, kinetically fast reduction at &#8722;0.43&#8197;V vs NHE at pH&#8197;9. DFT studies revealed that the high solubility of (CBu)2V is attributed to its high molecular polarity while its negative reduction potential is benefitted from electron&#8208;donating carboxylate groups. A 0.89&#8197;V (CBu)2V/(NH)4Fe(CN)6 AORFB demonstrated exceptional energy storage performance, specifically, 100&#8201;% capacity retention with a discharge energy density of 9.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles, power densities of up to 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an energy efficiency of 70&#8201;% at 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. (CBu)2V not only represents the most capacity dense viologen with pendant ionic groups and also exhibits the longest (1200&#8197;hours or 50&#8197;days) and the most stable flow battery performance to date.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell&#8208;Free Biosensors for Antibody Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum using electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensors. The platform is based on programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the transcription of an RNA sequence consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor.







Abstract
We report here the development of an electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensor for antibody detection directly in complex sample matrices with high sensitivity and specificity that is particularly suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The approach is based on the use of programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a specific target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected using a redox&#8208;modified probe strand immobilized to a disposable electrode. The platform couples the features of high sensitivity and specificity of cell&#8208;free systems and the strength of cost&#8208;effectiveness and possible miniaturization provided by the electrochemical detection. We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of three different antibodies, including the clinically&#8208;relevant Anti&#8208;HA antibody.

         <title>Unraveling the Structure Transition and Peroxidase Mimic Activity of Copper Sites over Atomically Dispersed Copper&#8208;Doped Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed copper&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs, with excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity were prepared from copper glutamate (Glu). The Cu binding sites in Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs had a Cu&#8722;N2C2 structure, and Cu&#8722;O bonds were converted into Cu&#8722;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. DFT calculations showed that H2O2 was cleaved by Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs by a dual&#8208;site catalytic pathway. The Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs enabled intracellular detection of H2O2.







Abstract
The lack of systematic structural resolution makes it difficult to build specific transition&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots (TMA&#8208;doped CPDs). Herein, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between Cu atoms and CPDs was evaluated by studying the peroxidase&#8208;like properties of Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs prepared by using copper glutamate (Glu) with a Cu&#8722;N2O2 initial structure. The results showed that the Cu atoms bound to Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs in the form of Cu&#8722;N2C2, indicating that Cu&#8722;O bonds changed into Cu&#8722;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. This phenomenon was also observed in other copper&#8208;doped CPDs. Moreover, the carboxyl and amino groups content decreased after copper&#8208;atom doping. Theoretical calculations revealed a dual&#8208;site catalytic mechanism for catalyzing H2O2. The detection of intracellular H2O2 suggested their application prospects. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation and catalytic mechanism of TMA&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs, allowing for the generation specific TMA&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs.

         <title>Na2Ba[Na2Sn2S7]: Structural Tolerance Factor&#8208;Guided NLO Performance Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the relationships between the structural tolerance factor and the dopant concentration and second&#8208;order susceptibility, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in Na2Ba[Na2Sn2S7] 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42&#8197;eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5&#215;AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12&#215;AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.







Abstract
The strong mutual coupling of and even the opposite change in the key parameters, such as the band gap (Eg) and second&#8208;order harmonic generation (SHG), leads to the extreme scarcity in high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides. Herein, we report 8 new sulfides, Na2Ba[(AgxNa1&#8722;x)2Sn2S7] (1, x=0; 1&#8197;series, x=0.1&#8211;0.6; Na2Ba[(Li0.58Na0.42)2Sn2S7], 1&#8208;0.6Li); Na2Sr[Cu2Sn2S7] (2); and Na2Ba[Cu2Sn2S7] (3). We use the structural tolerance factor (
) to connect the chemical composition, crystal structure, and NLO properties. Guided by these correlations, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42&#8197;eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5&#215;AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12&#215;AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.

         <title>Nanostructured Heterogeneous Catalysts for Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the use of Pd&#8208;, Au&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions are reviewed and discussed in detail. Synthetic strategies, applications, and external stimuli&#8208;driven processes are compiled, setting the basis for future development in this field.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry has inspired a new subarea of chemistry providing a powerful tool to perform novel biocompatible chemospecific reactions in living systems. Following the premise that they do not interfere with biological functions, bioorthogonal reactions are increasingly applied in biomedical research, particularly with respect to genetic encoding systems, fluorogenic reactions for bioimaging, and cancer therapy. This Minireview compiles recent advances in the use of heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions. The synthetic strategies of Pd&#8208;, Au&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;based materials, their applicability in the activation of caged fluorophores and prodrugs, and the possibilities of using external stimuli to release therapeutic substances at a specific location in a diseased tissue are discussed. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this emerging field.

         <title>A General Synthetic Route to High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Oxide Nanoparticles and Their Enhanced Solar Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generalization in preparing perovskite oxide nanomaterials with high purity and crystalline quality is crucial to permit their full study and widen their applicative potentials. We provide a generic and robust chemical bath route for synthesizing nano&#8208;shaped rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based REMO3 nanoparticles oxides (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al) by simply changing the desired nitrate salts.







Abstract
The main limitations of current methods for synthesizing perovskite oxide (ABO3) nanoparticles (NPs), e.g., the high reagent costs and sophisticated equipment, the long time and high&#8208;temperature processing, or multiple post&#8208;processing and thermal treatment steps, hamper their full study and potential application. Here, we use a facile low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) chemical bath synthesis and only one annealing step to successfully produce high phase purity and crystalline quality nano&#8208;shaped rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based REMO3 NPs (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al). We also show the versatility of this approach by fabricating La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 solid solution and non&#8208;RE&#8208;based BiFeO3 perovskite. To assess the potential of the as&#8208;prepared REFeO3 and REMnO3 NPs, they are used for photocatalytic degradation of the norfloxacin antibiotic and show high efficiency. We believe this easy, robust, versatile, and general route for synthesizing ABO3&#8208;based NPs can be further explored in the vast perovskite family and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;The main limitations of current methods for synthesizing perovskite oxide (ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles (NPs), e.g., the high reagent costs and sophisticated equipment, the long time and high-temperature processing, or multiple post-processing and thermal treatment steps, hamper their full study and potential application. Here, we use a facile low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) chemical bath synthesis and only one annealing step to successfully produce high phase purity and crystalline quality nano-shaped rare-earth-based REMO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al). We also show the versatility of this approach by fabricating La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solid solution and non-RE-based BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. To assess the potential of the as-prepared REFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and REMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs, they are used for photocatalytic degradation of the norfloxacin antibiotic and show high efficiency. We believe this easy, robust, versatile, and general route for synthesizing ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based NPs can be further explored in the vast perovskite family and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decreased Water Mobility Contributes To Increased &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ions can influence the mobility of water molecules in the solvation shell of a protein, which is important for folding and function. We show ions that decrease water mobility contribute to decreased protein mobility and subsequently to an increase in the self&#8208;association and aggregation rate. Alteration in water mobility may occur in ageing cells where ion concentrations become dysregulated and therefore promote &#945;Syn aggregation.







Abstract
The solvation shell is essential for the folding and function of proteins, but how it contributes to protein misfolding and aggregation has still to be elucidated. We show that the mobility of solvation shell H2O molecules influences the aggregation rate of the amyloid protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn), a protein associated with Parkinson's disease. When the mobility of H2O within the solvation shell is reduced by the presence of NaCl, &#945;Syn aggregation rate increases. Conversely, in the presence CsI the mobility of the solvation shell is increased and &#945;Syn aggregation is reduced. Changing the solvent from H2O to D2O leads to increased aggregation rates, indicating a solvent driven effect. We show the increased aggregation rate is not directly due to a change in the structural conformations of &#945;Syn, it is also influenced by a reduction in both the H2O mobility and &#945;Syn mobility. We propose that reduced mobility of &#945;Syn contributes to increased aggregation by promoting intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stability Challenges and Opportunities in Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale application of polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is suffering from long&#8208;term stability challenges in anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This review provides a thorough discussion of degradation mechanisms, catalyst design principles and future research opportunities to serve as a cornerstone for overcoming the dilemma in acidic OER stability and achieving the industrialization of water electrolysis.







Abstract
Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) has been regarded as a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long&#8208;term stability impose a grand challenge in its large&#8208;scale industrialization. In this review, critical factors that may lead to catalyst's instability in couple with potential solutions are comprehensively discussed, including mechanical peeling, substrate corrosion, active&#8208;site over&#8208;oxidation/dissolution, reconstruction, oxide crystal structure collapse through the lattice oxygen&#8208;participated reaction pathway, etc. Last but not least, personal prospects are provided in terms of rigorous stability evaluation criteria, in situ/operando characterizations, economic feasibility and practical electrolyzer consideration, highlighting the ternary relationship of structure evolution, industrial&#8208;relevant activity and stability to serve as a roadmap towards the ultimate application of PEMWE.

         <title>An Anomalous Electron Configuration Among 3d Transition Metal Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special [Ar]4s1 electron configuration was revealed for Sc2+ in ScS, with no typical 3d orbital features and a bare population of t2g orbital from electron density reconstruction and orbital population analysis. Our work should be the first to report such anomalous electron structure with preferred 4s over 3d orbital for 3d transition metal atoms and may provide a new method to modulate material properties via artificial orbital adjustment.







Abstract
Physical properties of materials are mainly determined by valence electron configurations, where different valence shells would induce divergent phenomena. In compounds containing Sc2+, 3d electron occupancy is expected, the same as other transition metal atoms like Ti3+. But this situation still awaits experimental verification in inorganic materials. Here, we selected ScS to measure the valence electron density and orbital population of Sc2+ through delicate quantitative convergent&#8208;beam electron diffraction. With the absence of 3d orbital features around Sc&#8208;atom sites and the nearly bare population of t2g orbital, the unintuitive occupation of 4s orbital in Sc2+ is concluded. It should be the first time to report such a special electron configuration in a transition metal compound, in which 4s rather than 3d orbital is preferred. Our findings reveal the distinct behavior of Sc and probable ways to modulate material properties by controlling electron orbitals.

         <title>Ranking Peptide Binders by Affinity with AlphaFold
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlphaFold is transforming the field of protein structure prediction. Standing on its highly accurate mapping between protein sequence and structure, we discovered a novel way to predict the ranking of peptide binding affinities through a competitive binding assay. While there are still limitations, we anticipate this approach can be easily adopted for identifying higher affinity peptide binders.







Abstract
AlphaFold has revolutionized structural biology by predicting highly accurate structures of proteins and their complexes with peptides and other proteins. However, for protein&#8208;peptide systems, we are also interested in identifying the highest affinity binder among a set of candidate peptides. We present a novel competitive binding assay using AlphaFold to predict structures of the receptor in the presence of two peptides. For systems in which the individual structures of the peptides are well predicted, the assay captures the higher affinity binder in the bound state, and the other peptide in the unbound form with statistical significance. We test the application on six protein receptors for which we have experimental binding affinities to several peptides. We find that the assay is best suited for identifying medium to strong peptide binders that adopt stable secondary structures upon binding.

         <title>Amyloid Against Amyloid: Dimeric Amyloid Fragment Ameliorates Cognitive Impairments by Direct Clearance of Oligomers and Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the N&#8208;terminal of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, we designed a dimeric A&#946;(1&#8211;17)&#8208;based peptide drug that crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier and dissociates amyloid plaques and oligomers upon administration to transgenic Alzheimer model mice.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in the form of neurotoxic aggregates is regarded as the main pathological initiator and key therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease. However, anti&#8208;A&#946; drug development has been impeded by the lack of a target needed for structure&#8208;based drug design and low permeability of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). An attractive therapeutic strategy is the development of amyloid&#8208;based anti&#8208;A&#946; peptidomimetics that exploit the self&#8208;assembling nature of A&#946; and penetrate the BBB. Herein, we designed a dimeric peptide drug candidate based on the N&#8208;terminal fragment of A&#946;, DAB, found to cross the BBB and solubilize A&#946; oligomers and fibrils. Administration of DAB reduced amyloid burden in 5XFAD mice, and downregulated neuroinflammation and prevented memory impairment in the Y&#8208;maze test. Peptide mapping assays and molecular docking studies were utilized to elucidate DAB&#8208;A&#946; interaction. To further understand the active regions of DAB, we assessed the dissociative activity of DAB with sequence modifications.

         <title>An Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Reporter for In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescent reporter (i.e., DMP2) is designed to specifically activate its NIR&#8208;II fluorescence upon binding to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibrils via a suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect. Benefiting from high specificity in response to A&#946; fibrils and suitable lipophilicity to penetrate BBB, DMP2 achieves in vivo visualization of A&#946; plaques in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for in vivo visualization of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) pathology, which can facilitate characterization and deep understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it has been rarely exploited. Herein, we report the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent reporters with a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) architecture for specific detection of A&#946; plaques in AD&#8208;model mice. Among all the designed probes, DMP2 exhibits the highest affinity to A&#946; fibrils and can specifically activate its NIR&#8208;II fluorescence after binding to A&#946; fibrils via suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. With suitable lipophilicity for ideal blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability and deep&#8208;tissue penetration of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, DMP2 possesses specific detection of A&#946; plaques in in vivo AD&#8208;model mice. Thus, this study presents a potential agent for non&#8208;invasive imaging of A&#946; plaques and deep deciphering of AD progression.

         <title>Enhanced Activity of Enzyme Immobilized on Hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 Modified by Ni2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize enzyme on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor, which can significantly promote the recyclability and activity of the enzyme.







Abstract
The development of efficient enzyme immobilization to promote their recyclability and activity is highly desirable. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been proved to be an effective platform for enzyme immobilization due to its easy preparation and biocompatibility. However, the intrinsic hydrophobic characteristic hinders its further development in this filed. Herein, a facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize pepsin (PEP) on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni). By contrast, the direct coating of PEP on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP) generated significant conformational changes. Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was employed to study the catalytic activity of immobilized PEP. The ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni composite attains remarkable OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of only 127&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is much lower than the 690 and 919&#8197;mV overpotential values of ZIF&#8208;8@PEP and PEP, respectively.

         <title>Quantitative Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay which allows imaging of single biomolecules with nanometer resolution based on localizing the repeated electrochemiluminescence reactions. Quantification of biomolecules is achieved by merging the clustered reactions at one molecule site and then counting the merged molecule numbers.







Abstract
A single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is developed here which allows imaging and direct quantification of single biomolecules. Imaging single biomolecules is realized by localizing the electrochemiluminescence events of the labeled molecules. Such an imaging system allows mapping the spatial distribution of biomolecules with electrochemiluminescence and contains quantitative single&#8208;molecule insights. We further quantify biomolecules by spatiotemporally merging the repeated reactions at one molecule site and then counting the clustered molecules. The proposed single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is used to detect carcinoembryonic antigen, showing a limit of detection of 67 attomole concentration which is 10&#8201;000 times better than conventional electrochemiluminescence bioassays. This spatial resolution and sensitivity enable single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay a new toolbox for both specific bioimaging and ultrasensitive quantitative analysis.

         <title>Direct Excitation of Aldehyde to Activate the C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond by Cobaloxime Catalysis toward Fluorenones Synthesis with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct excitation of aldehydes to activate their C(sp2)&#8722;H bond through cobaloxime catalysis has been successfully developed. Upon irradiation, the highly reactive photoexcited triplet state of aromatic aldehyde intermediates is intercepted by the catalyst in the ground state, thus leading to the synthesis of a series of fluorenones, xanthones and thioxanthones in good to excellent yields without any external oxidants and with hydrogen as the byproduct.







Abstract
A new way to form fluorenones via the direct excitation of substrates instead of photocatalyst to activate the C(sp2)&#8722;H bond under redox&#8208;neutral condition is reported. Our design relies on the photoexcited aromatic aldehyde intermediates that can be intercepted by cobaloxime catalyst through single electron transfer for following &#946;&#8208;H elimination. The generation of acyl radical and successful interception by a metal catalyst cobaloxime avoid the use of a photocatalyst and stoichiometric external oxidants, affording a series of highly substituted fluorenones, including six&#8208;membered ketones, such as xanthone and thioxanthone derivatives in good to excellent yields, and with hydrogen as the only byproduct. This catalytic system features a readily available metal catalyst, mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope, in which sunlight reaction and scale&#8208;up experiments by continuous&#8208;flow approach make the new methodology sustainable and amenable for potentially operational procedures.

         <title>Mechanisms and Synthetic Strategies in Visible Light&#8208;Driven [2+2]&#8208;Heterocycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between alkenes and carbonyls is a formidable strategy for the synthesis of complex strained 3D architectures. This Review provides an overview on the recent development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions driven by visible light. The diverse synthetic approaches are presented with special emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms along with possible future directions of the field.







Abstract
The synthesis of four membered heterocycles usually requires multi&#8208;step procedures and prefunctionalized reactants. A straightforward alternative is the photochemical [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between an alkene and a carbonyl derivative, conventionally based on the photoexcitation of this latter. However, this approach is limited by the absorption profile of the carbonyl, requiring in most of the cases the use of high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;light, that often results in undesired side reactions and/or the degradation of the reaction components. The development of new and milder visible light&#8208;driven [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions is, therefore, highly desirable. In this Review, we highlight the most relevant achievements in the development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions promoted by visible light, with a particular emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms. The open challenges will also be discussed, suggesting new possible evolutions, and stimulating new methodological developments in the field.

         <title>Wacker Oxidation of Methylenecyclobutanes: Scope and Selectivity in an Unusual Setting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylenecyclobutanes undergo Wacker oxidation towards cyclopentanones under mild reaction conditions. A semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;type rearrangement is proposed to be responsible for the intermediary 1,2&#8208;shift, which not only explains the formation of the products, but also rationalizes the reaction outcomes in terms of site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Methylenecyclobutanes are found to undergo Wacker oxidation via a semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;type rearrangement. Key to a successful process is the use of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as oxidant, which not only enables efficient catalyst turn&#8208;over but also ensures high Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions. Thus, cyclopentanones (26 examples) can be accessed in an overall good yield and excellent selectivity (up to 97&#8201;% yield, generally &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 ketone:aldehyde ratio). Stereochemical analysis of the reaction sequence reveals migration aptitudes in line with related 1,2&#8208;shifts. By introducing a pyox ligand to palladium, prochiral methylenecyclobutanes can be desymmetrized, thus realizing the first enantioselective Wacker oxidation.

         <title>A Widely Distributed Biosynthetic Cassette Is Responsible for Diverse Plant Side Chain Cross&#8208;Linked Cyclopeptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopeptide alkaloids are a diverse class of plants natural products, yet little is known of their biosynthesis. By combining transcriptomics and genome mining, we uncover a widespread biosynthetic cassette responsible for side chain cross&#8208;linked cyclopeptides. We validate these observations by isolating a new cyclopeptide from Coffea arabica and reconstituting enzymatic activity for the family defining split BURP peptide cyclase.







Abstract
Cyclopeptide alkaloids are an abundant class of plant cyclopeptides with over 200 analogs described and bioactivities ranging from analgesic to antiviral. While these natural products have been known for decades, their biosynthetic basis remains unclear. Using a transcriptome&#8208;mining approach, we link the cyclopeptide alkaloids from Ceanothus americanus to dedicated RiPP precursor peptides and identify new, widely distributed split BURP peptide cyclase containing gene clusters. Guided by our bioinformatic analysis, we identify and isolate new cyclopeptides from Coffea arabica, which we named arabipeptins. Reconstitution of the enzyme activity for the BURP found in the biosynthesis of arabipeptin A validates the activity of the newly discovered split BURP peptide cyclases. These results expand our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for diverse cyclic plant peptides and suggest that these side chain cross&#8208;link modifications are widely distributed in eudicots.

         <title>Constructing Mechanical Shuttles in a Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Porous Architecture for Selective Transport of Lithium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crown ether mechanically interlocked three&#8208;dimensional porous architecture is prepared as the porous filler of mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The mechanical shuttles speed up the ion transport in the adsorbent solid, leading to a rapid and selective transport of lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) extraction from brines is a major barrier to the sustainable development of batteries and alloys; however, current separation technology suffers from a trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and permeability. Herein, a crown ether mechanically interlocked 3D porous organic framework (Crown&#8208;POF) was prepared as the porous filler of thin&#8208;film nanocomposite membranes. Crown&#8208;POF with penta&#8208;coordinated (four Ocrown atoms and one Ntert&#8208;amine atom) adsorption sites enables a special recognition for Li+ ion. Moreover, the four Ntert&#8208;amine atoms on each POF branch facilitate the flipping motion of Li+ ion along the skeletal thread, while retaining the specified binding pattern. Accordingly, the crown ether interlocked POF network displays an ultrafast ion transfer rate, over 10&#8197;times that of the conventional porous materials. Notably, the nanocomposite membrane gives high speed and selectivity for Li+ ion transport as compared with other porous solid&#8208;based mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Peptidyl&#8208;Cysteine Oxidation by the Copper&#8208;Dependent Formylglycine&#8208;Generating Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM calculations reveal the reaction mechanism of the FGE&#8208;catalyzed oxidative conversion of peptidyl&#8208;cysteines into formylglycine. Triplet&#8208;singlet crossing initiates the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom abstraction from substrate to generate a CuII&#8722;OOH species. A nearby water molecule plays a vital role in the formation of the CuI&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, which is the key species that can undergo O&#8722;O bond cleavage to give formylglycine.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;dependent formylglycine&#8208;generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxygen&#8208;dependent oxidation of specific peptidyl&#8208;cysteine residues to formylglycine. Our QM/MM calculations provide a very likely mechanism for this transformation. The reaction starts with dioxygen binding to the tris&#8208;thiolate CuI center to form a triplet CuII&#8208;superoxide complex. The rate&#8208;determining hydrogen atom abstraction involves a triplet&#8208;singlet crossing to form a CuII&#8722;OOH species that couples with the substrate radical, leading to a CuI&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate. This is accompanied by proton transfer from the hydroperoxide to the S atom of the substrate via a nearby water molecule. The subsequent O&#8722;O bond cleavage is coupled with the C&#8722;S bond breaking that generates the formylglycine and a CuII&#8208;oxyl complex. Moreover, our results suggest that the aldehyde oxygen of the final product originates from O2, which will be useful for future experimental work.

         <title>Porous Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced porous materials (APMs) including MOFs, COFs, and POPs, have seen tremendous development as effective adsorbents for the segregation of components of interest. In this Review, recent advancements of APMs applied for water purification are overviewed systematically according to the type of water contaminant.







Abstract
Water pollution is a growing threat to humanity due to the pervasiveness of contaminants in water bodies. Significant efforts have been made to separate these hazardous components to purify polluted water through various methods. However, conventional remediation methods suffer from limitations such as low uptake capacity or selectivity, and current water quality standards cannot be met. Recently, advanced porous materials (APMs) have shown promise in improved segregation of contaminants compared to traditional porous materials in uptake capacity and selectivity. These materials feature merits of high surface area and versatile functionality, rendering them ideal platforms for the design of novel adsorbents. This Review summarizes the development and employment of APMs in a variety of water treatments accompanied by assessments of task&#8208;specific adsorption performance. Finally, we discuss our perspectives on future opportunities for APMs in water purification.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Afterglow from Classical Aggregation&#8208;Caused Quenching Compounds for White&#8208;Light&#8208;Manipulated Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>

         <dc:description>
Luminescent materials with dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence were developed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate, respectively. It is found that their afterglow can be excited by ultraviolet and white light, and the persistent luminescence colors can be tuned by varying temperatures and dopant concentrations.







Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow excited by ultraviolet (UV) and white light was achieved from classical aggregation&#8208;caused quenching compounds for the first time. Specifically, two luminescent systems, which could produce significant organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence under ambient conditions, were constructed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate. Their lifetimes surpassed 600&#8197;ms, and the dopant concentrations were as low as 5&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Moreover, the persistent luminescence colors of the materials could be tuned from blue to green and then to yellow by simply varying the concentrations of guest compounds or the temperature in the range of 260&#8211;340&#8197;K. Inspired by these exciting results, the afterglow materials were used for UV&#8208; and white&#8208;light&#8208;manipulated anti&#8208;counterfeiting and preparation of elastomers with different colors of persistent luminescence.

         <title>Organoboron Reagent&#8208;Controlled Selective (Deutero)Hydrodefluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein reported an electrochemical selective (deutero)hydrodefluorination reaction of trifluoroacetamides. The reaction which exhibits a remarkable chemoselectivity control and delivers (deuterium&#8208;labeled) CF2H&#8208; and CFH2&#8208;products in good yields with high level of deuterium incorporation, respectively, is enabled by the addition of different organoboron sources and (deuterated)water as the deuterium or hydrogen source.







Abstract
(Deuterium&#8208;labeled) CF2H&#8208; and CFH2&#8208;moieties are of high interest in drug discovery. The high demand for the incorporation of these fluoroalkyl moieties into molecular structures has witnessed significant synthetic progress, particularly in the (deutero)hydrodefluorination of CF3&#8208;containing compounds. However, the controllable replacement of fluorine atoms while maintaining high chemoselectivity remains challenging. Herein, we describe the development of a selective (deutero)hydrodefluorination reaction via electrolysis. The reaction exhibits a remarkable chemoselectivity control, which is enabled by the addition of different organoboron sources. The procedure is operationally simple and scalable, and provides access in one step to high&#8208;value building blocks for application in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to investigate the reaction mechanism and to rationalize the chemoselectivity observed.

         <title>Altering Oxygen Binding by Redox&#8208;Inactive Metal Substitution to Control Catalytic Activity: Oxygen Reduction on Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles as a Model System
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted manganese oxide nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M, were studied as a model system to generalize the electronic effect of redox&#8208;inactive substituents on the electrocatalytic activity of the oxides. The oxygen reduction activity of Mn3O4:M correlates with the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ site. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of materials that influence their performance will advance the rational engineering of new catalytic materials. In this study, by investigating metal&#8208;substituted manganese oxide (spinel) nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M (M=Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), we rationalize the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide, &#916;fH&#176;(MO), and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M with low &#916;fH&#176;(MO) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which affects its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis relying on the rational substitution/doping by redox&#8208;inactive elements.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent MxAl3 Cluster Salts with Tetrahedral [SiAl3]+ and Trigonal&#8208;Bipyramidal [M2Al3]2+ Cores (M=Si/Ge)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive tetrahedral [Cp*Si(AlCp*)3]+ cation is prepared as its aluminate salts starting from Jutzi's [SiCp*]+ cation and Schn&#246;ckel's [(AlCp*)4]. Owing to its good accessibility, [SiAl3]+ can act as starting point towards the synthesis of low&#8208;valent silicon&#8208;doped aluminium&#8208;cluster cores as shown by the preparation of the larger [Si2(AlCp*)5]2+ cluster cation.







Abstract
Schn&#246;ckel's [(AlCp*)4] and Jutzi's [SiCp*][B(C6F5)4] (Cp*=C5Me5) are landmarks in modern main&#8208;group chemistry with diverse applications in synthesis and catalysis. Despite the isoelectronic relationship between the AlCp* and the [SiCp*]+ fragments, their mutual reactivity is hitherto unknown. Here, we report on their reaction giving the complex salts [Cp*Si(AlCp*)3][WCA] ([WCA]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The tetrahedral [SiAl3]+ core not only represents a rare example of a low&#8208;valent silicon&#8208;doped aluminium&#8208;cluster, but also&#8212;due to its facile accessibility and high stability&#8212;provides a convenient preparative entry towards low&#8208;valent Si&#8722;Al clusters in general. For example, an elusive binuclear [Si2(AlCp*)5]2+ with extremely short Al&#8722;Si bonds and a high negative partial charge at the Si atoms was structurally characterised and its bonding situation analysed by DFT. Crystals of the isostructural [Ge2(AlCp*)5]2+ dication were also obtained and represent the first mixed Al&#8722;Ge cluster.

For example, an elusive binuclear [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(AlCp*)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with extremely short Al&#8722;Si bonds and a high negative partial charge at the Si atoms was structurally characterised and its bonding situation analysed by DFT.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Screening Custom&#8208;Designed Warhead&#8208;Armed Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general strategy for a yeast&#8208;based screening platform that we call custom&#8208;designed warhead&#8208;armed cyclic peptide screening (or CWCPS). This platform has led to the discovery of a potent inhibitor CY5&#8208;6Q that targets human histone deacetylase 8 with a KD value in the double&#8208;digit nanomolar range. This strategy can be a versatile platform for peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.







Abstract
Demand for peptide&#8208;based pharmaceuticals has been steadily increasing, but only limited success has been achieved to date. To expedite peptide&#8208;based drug discovery, we developed a general scheme for cell&#8208;based screening of cyclic peptide inhibitors armed with a user&#8208;designed warhead. We combined unnatural amino acid incorporation and split intein&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization techniques and integrated a yeast&#8208;based colorimetric screening assay to generate a new scheme that we call the custom&#8208;designed warhead&#8208;armed cyclic peptide screening platform (CWCPS). This strategy successfully discovered a potent inhibitor, CY5&#8208;6Q, that targets human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) with a KD value of 15&#8197;nM. This approach can be a versatile and general platform for discovering cyclic peptide inhibitors.

         <title>Simultaneous Harvesting of Multiple Hot Holes via Visible&#8208;Light Excitation of Plasmonic Gold Nanospheres for Selective Oxidative Bond Scission of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harvesting of multiple hot holes has been demonstrated using Au nanospheres for the plasmonic photocatalytic oxidative scission of olefin to carbonyls through a step&#8208;down process. Interband photoexcitation of Au nanospheres beyond a threshold intensity leads to a spurt in hot&#8208;carrier generation, enabling multifold enhancement in substrate activation compared to a dark process.







Abstract
Using visible photoexcitation of gold nanospheres we successfully demonstrate the simultaneous harvesting of plasmon&#8208;induced multiple hot holes in the complete oxidative scission of the C=C bond in styrene at room temperature to selectively form benzaldehyde and formaldehyde, which is a reaction that requires activation of multiple substrates. Our results reveal that, while extraction of hot holes becomes efficient for interband excitation, harvesting of multiple hot holes from the excited Au nanospheres becomes prevalent only beyond a threshold light intensity. We show that the alkene oxidation proceeded via a sequence of two consecutive elementary steps; namely, a binding step and a cyclic oxometallate transition state as the rate&#8208;determining step. This demonstration of plasmon&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated harvesting of multiple hot holes without the use of an extra hole transport media opens exciting possibilities, notably for difficult catalytic transformations involving multielectron oxidation processes.

         <title>A Configurationally Confined Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Two&#8208;Coordinate CuI Complex for Efficient Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) two&#8208;coordinate CuI complex is designed by configurationally confined strategy. With proper twist angle around 45&#176; between ligands, fast radiative decay is achieved with balanced &#916;EST and kr of S1, meanwhile, knr is also depressed. As demonstrated in efficient OLED with high EQE over 20&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off less than 2&#8201;%, configurationally confined strategy is practical for developing novel CuI TADF emitters.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from linear two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes is sensitive to the geometric arrangement of the ligands. Herein we realize the tuning of configuration from coplanar to orthogonal gradually by variation of substituents. In a complex with confined twist configuration, its blue emission peaking at 458&#8197;nm presents a high &#934;PL of 0.74 and a short &#964;TADF of 1.9 &#956;s, which indicates a fast enough kr,TADF of 3.9&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a depressed knr of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Such outstanding luminescent properties are attributed to the proper overlap of HOMO and LUMO on CuI d orbitals that guarantees not only small &#916;EST but also sufficient transition oscillator strength for fast 
. Vacuum&#8208;deposited blue OLEDs with either doped or host&#8208;free emissive layer present external quantum efficiencies over 20&#8201;% and 10&#8201;%, respectively, demonstrating the practicality of the configurationally confined strategy for efficient linear CuI TADF emitters.

         <title>Monitoring Transformations of Catalytic Active States in Photocathodes Based on MoSx Layers on CuInS2 Using In Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical state of a CuInS2/MoSx photocathode surface was investigated by Raman spectroscopy under actual photoelectrochemical H2 evolution reaction conditions. In operando Raman spectroscopy revealed the nature of MoSx activation during PEC H2 evolution, which was not revealed by ex situ XPS or Raman spectroscopy. In operando Raman spectroscopy characterization is a promising tool for photoelectrochemical cells.







Abstract
The electrochemical activation of CuInS2/MoSx for photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production was revealed for the first time through in operando Raman spectroscopy. During the activation process, the initial metallic MoSx phase was transformed to semiconducting MoSx, which facilitates charge carrier transfer between CuInS2 and MoSx. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy suggest the existence of MoO3 after the activation process. However, apart from contradicting these results, in operando Raman spectroscopy revealed some of the intermediate steps of the activation process.

         <title>Swelling&#8208;induced Mechanochromism in Multinetwork Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Swelling&#8208;force&#8208;induced mechanochemical reactions were observed in multinetwork polymers. Sequential swelling of network polymers stretches the network strands, and finally induces selective mechanical scission events at the difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN) mechano&#8208;responsive units, which generate air&#8208;stable radicals with pink color. The increased thermal reactivity of DFSN and kinetic stability of the resulting radicals were also discovered.







Abstract
We report a novel and versatile approach to achieving swelling&#8208;induced mechanochemistry using a multinetwork (MN) strategy that enables polymer networks to repeatedly swell with monomers and solvents. The isotropic expansion of the first network (FN) provides sufficient force to drive the mechanochemical scission of a radical&#8208;based mechanophore, difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN). Although prompt recombination generally occurs in such highly mobile environments, the resulting pink radicals are kinetically stabilized in the gels, probably due to limited diffusion in the extended polymer chains. Moreover, the DFSN embedded in the isotropically strained chain exhibits increased thermal reactivity, which can be reasonably explained by an entropic contribution of the FN to the dissociation.

     alt="Swelling-induced Mechanochromism in Multinetwork Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swelling-force-induced mechanochemical reactions were observed in multinetwork polymers. Sequential swelling of network polymers stretches the network strands, and finally induces selective mechanical scission events at the difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN) mechano-responsive units, which generate air-stable radicals with pink color. The increased thermal reactivity of DFSN and kinetic stability of the resulting radicals were also discovered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a novel and versatile approach to achieving swelling-induced mechanochemistry using a multinetwork (MN) strategy that enables polymer networks to repeatedly swell with monomers and solvents. The isotropic expansion of the first network (FN) provides sufficient force to drive the mechanochemical scission of a radical-based mechanophore, difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN). Although prompt recombination generally occurs in such highly mobile environments, the resulting pink radicals are kinetically stabilized in the gels, probably due to limited diffusion in the extended polymer chains. Moreover, the DFSN embedded in the isotropically strained chain exhibits increased thermal reactivity, which can be reasonably explained by an entropic contribution of the FN to the dissociation. The utility of the MN polymers is demonstrated not only in terms of swelling-force-induced network modification, but also in the context of tunable reactivity of the dissociative unit through proper design of the hierarchical network architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Relaxivity Gap in pH&#8208;Responsive FeIII&#8208;Based MRI Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferric chelates act as molecular probes for a changing pH by a 21&#8208; and 71&#8208;fold change in their relaxivity. This unprecedented performance became possible thanks to a pendant&#8208;arm design within the hexadentate ligand ensuring virtually complete coordination at high pH and de&#8208;coordination at low pH. Both probes do not show any detectable fatigue over several activation/de&#8208;activation cycles, underscoring the elevated robustness of the system.







Abstract
Two mononuclear ferric complexes are reported that respond to a pH change with a 27&#8208; and 71&#8208;fold jump, respectively, in their capacity to accelerate the longitudinal relaxation rate of water&#8208;hydrogen nuclei, and this starting from a negligible base value of only 0.06. This unprecedented performance bodes well for tackling the sensitivity issues hampering the development of Molecular MRI. The two chelates also excel in the fully reversible and fatigue&#8208;less nature of this phenomenon. The structural reasons for this performance reside in the macrocyclic nature of the hexa&#8208;dentate ligand, as well as the presence of a single pendant arm displaying a five&#8208;membered lactam or carbamate which show (perturbed) pKa values of 3.5 in the context of this N6
N5O1 coordination motif.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroarenes are abundant and readily available feedstocks. However, due to the high reduction potentials of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes, their photoreduction remains a continuing challenge, motivating the development of efficient activation modes to address this issue. This report presents the blue light&#8208;induced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed single electron reduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings. We discovered that under blue light irradiation, NHC/tBuOK combination could construct powerful photoactive architectures to promote single electron transfer for Caryl&#8211;F bond reduction via forming highly reducing NHC radical anion. Notably, the strategy was also successful to reduce Caryl&#8211;O, Caryl&#8211;N, and Caryl&#8211;S bonds for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine Dimers and Their Low&#8208;Temperature Isomerization: A High&#8208;Resolution Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding between two neutral aromatic compounds, especially small ones, has been controversially debated in the last decades, and terms like &#8220;&#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; had to be revised. Surprisingly, despite of many experimental and computational work, there is still no clear consensus about the structure of and the bonding in the pyridine dimer. In this work, for different isomeric forms of the pyridine dimer, the structures and bonding were elucidated by combining high&#8208;resolution matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic results with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. High&#8208;resolution IR spectra of Ne matrices at 4 K containing pyridine were recorded for different concentrations and upon annealing to 10 and 12 K, relying on three isotopologues of pyridine. The spectra show the presence of hydrogen&#8208;bonded, T&#8208;shaped, and stacked forms of weakly&#8208;bound pyridine dimers. Among these, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded isomer is identified as the lowest&#8208;energy form. The results provide for the first time conclusive information about the interaction between two pyridine dimers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is of great significance for the fabrication of miniaturized optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting transistors. However, great challenge exists in designing key materials, especially those who integrates triplet exciton utilization ability. Herein, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs), with 2,6&#8208;extended anthracene donor, and 3&#8217;&#8208; or 4&#8217;&#8208;substituted naphthalene monoimide acceptors were designed and synthesized. By introducing acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor structure, both materials show high electron mobility. Moreover, by fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26%, high electron mobility of 0.02 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, and the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence was obtained in 4&#8217;&#8208;DNADI.

         <title>De&#8208;Linker&#8208;Enabled Exceptional Volumetric Acetylene Storage Capacity and Benchmark C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An ideal adsorbent for separation requires optimizing both storage capacity and selectivity, but maximizing both or achieving a desired balance remain challenging. Herein, a de&#8208;linker strategy is proposed to address this issue for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Broadly speaking, the de&#8208;linker idea targets a class of materials that may be viewed as being intermediate between zeolites and MOFs. Its feasibility is shown here by a series of ultra&#8208;microporous MOFs (SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;M, M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn). SNNU&#8208;98 exhibit high volumetric C2H2 uptake capacity under low and ambient pressures (175.3 cm3 cm&#8208;3 @ 0.1 bar, 222.9 cm3 cm&#8208;3 @ 1 bar, 298 K), as well as extraordinary selectivity (2405.7 for C2H2/C2H4, 22.7 for C2H2/CO2). Remarkably, SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;Mn can efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with a benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) breakthrough time of 2325 min g&#8208;1, and produce 99.9999% C2H4 with a productivity up to 64.6 mmol g&#8208;1, surpassing values of reported MOF adsorbents.</dc:description>

Its feasibility is shown here by a series of ultra-microporous MOFs (SNNU-98-M, M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn). SNNU-98 exhibit high volumetric C2H2 uptake capacity under low and ambient pressures (175.3 cm3 cm-3 @ 0.1 bar, 222.9 cm3 cm-3 @ 1 bar, 298 K), as well as extraordinary selectivity (2405.7 for C2H2/C2H4, 22.7 for C2H2/CO2). Remarkably, SNNU-98-Mn can efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with a benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) breakthrough time of 2325 min g-1, and produce 99.9999% C2H4 with a productivity up to 64.6 mmol g-1, surpassing values of reported MOF adsorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Acetylene Sorption through Induced&#8208;fit Transformations in a Chemically Stable Microporous Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid/base&#8208;resistant framework with adaptive pores was prepared; it could effectively capture C2H2 with a record&#8208;high storage density but a very low adsorption enthalpy. Mechanism studies demonstrate that such excellent performance comes from the synergism of active sites, flexible framework, and matched pores, where the adsorbed&#8208;C2H2 can drive framework to undergo continuous induced&#8208;fit transformations, finally leading to dense packing of C2H2.







Abstract
Developing practical storage technologies for acetylene (C2H2) is important but challenging because C2H2 is useful but explosive. Here, a novel metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (FJI&#8208;H36) with adaptive channels was prepared. It can effectively capture C2H2 (159.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3) at 1&#8197;atm and 298&#8197;K, possessing a record&#8208;high storage density (561&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) but a very low adsorption enthalpy (28&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) among all the reported MOFs. Structural analyses show that such excellent adsorption performance comes from the synergism of active sites, flexible framework, and matched pores; where the adsorbed&#8208;C2H2 can drive FJI&#8208;H36 to undergo induced&#8208;fit transformations step by step, including deformation/reconstruction of channels, contraction of pores, and transformation of active sites, finally leading to dense packing of C2H2. Moreover, FJI&#8208;H36 has excellent chemical stability and recyclability, and can be prepared on a large scale, enabling it as a practical adsorbent for C2H2. This will provide a useful strategy for developing practical and efficient adsorbents for C2H2 storage.

         <title>Superlattice&#8208;based Plasmonic Catalysis: Concentrating Light at the Nanoscale to Drive Efficient Nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Fixation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organizing anisotropic plasmonic nanoparticles into a two&#8208;dimensional superlattice is important to intensify the electromagnetic field at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels for efficient nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photoconversion at ambient conditions. Our unique superlattice&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts boost the ammonia formation rate and apparent quantum efficiency by up to &#8776;15&#8208;fold and &#8776;103&#8208;fold, respectively, when compared to traditional photocatalytic and hybrid plasmonic&#8208;photocatalytic designs.







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis promises green ammonia synthesis but is limited by the need for co&#8208;catalysts and poor performances due to weak electromagnetic field enhancement. Here, we use two&#8208;dimensional plasmonic superlattices with dense electromagnetic hotspots to boost ambient nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photoconversion without needing co&#8208;catalyst. By organizing Ag octahedra into a square superlattice to concentrate light, the ammonia formation is enhanced by &#8776;15&#8208;fold and 4&#8208;fold over hexagonal superlattice and disorganized array, respectively. Our unique catalyst achieves superior ammonia formation rate and apparent quantum yield up to &#8776;15&#8208;fold and &#8776;103&#8208;fold, respectively, better than traditional designs. Mechanistic investigations reveal the abundance of intense plasmonic hotspots is crucial to promote hot electron generation and transfer for nitrogen reduction. Our work offers valuable insights to design electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts for diverse chemical and energy applications.

         <title>Probing the Nature of Zinc in Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Zirconium Catalysts by Operando Spectroscopies for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Cu&#8722;Zn&#8722;Zr catalysts, interfaces between Cu and atomically dispersed Zn species are established by separating Zn and Zr from Cu in the double nozzles utilized during flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). Operando spectroscopies confirm that the structure is created during CO2 hydrogenation, and it boosts methanol production by suppressing formate decomposition to CO and decreasing the H2 dissociation energy.







Abstract
Active Zn species in Cu&#8208;based methanol synthesis catalysts have not been clearly identified yet due to their complex nature and dynamic structural changes during reactions. Herein, atomically dispersed Zn on ZrO2 support is established in Cu&#8208;based catalysts by separating Zn and Zr components from Cu (Cu&#8722;ZnZr) via the double&#8208;nozzle flame spray pyrolysis (DFSP) method. It exhibits superiority in methanol selectivity and yield compared to those with Cu&#8722;ZnO interface and isolated ZnO nanoparticles. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the atomically dispersed Zn species are induced during the reaction due to the strengthened Zn&#8722;Zr interaction. They can suppress formate decomposition to CO and decrease the H2 dissociation energy, shifting the reaction to methanol production. This work enlightens the rational design of unique Zn species by regulating coordination environments and offers a new perspective for exploring complex interactions in multi&#8208;component catalysts.

         <title>Stainless Steel&#8208;Like Passivation Inspires Persistent Silicon Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional bulk&#8208;passivated and surface&#8208;coated Si films were developed to mitigate volume expansion of Si anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and study the stainless steel&#8208;like passivation mechanism by various characterizations.







Abstract
Passivation of stainless steel by additives forming mass&#8208;transport blocking layers is widely practiced, where Cr element is added into bulk Fe&#8722;C forming the Cr2O3&#8208;rich protective layer. Here we extend the long&#8208;practiced passivation concept to Si anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, incorporating the passivator of LiF/Li2CO3 into bulk Si. The passivation mechanism is studied by various ex situ characterizations, redox peak contour maps, thickness evolution tests, and finite element simulations. The results demonstrate that the passivation can enhance the (de)lithiation of Li&#8208;Si alloys, induce the formation of F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, stabilize the Si/LiF/Li2CO3 composite, and mitigate the volume change of Si anodes upon cycling. The 3D passivated Si anode can fully retain a high capacity of 3701&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles and tolerate high rates up to 50C. This work provides insight into how to construct durable Si anodes through effective passivation.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Halogen Bonding in an Ionic Cavity of a Coordination Cage Based on a Copper(I) Iodide Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual Cu3I4&#8722; based coordination cage was synthesized by a reaction between copper(I) iodide and a tripodal cationic ligand. X&#8208;ray structural evidence demonstrates that this cage can selectively encapsulate bromomethanes by concerted ligand&#8208;iodide&#8208;bromomethane ionic and halogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
The design of molecular containers capable of selectively binding specific guest molecules presents an interesting synthetic challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report the synthesis and structure of a coordination cage assembled from Cu3I4&#8722; clusters and tripodal cationic N&#8208;donor ligands. Owing to the localized permanent charges in the ligand core the cage binds iodide anions in specific regions within the cage through ionic interactions. This allows the selective binding of bromomethanes as secondary guest species within the cage promoted by halogen bonding, which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;assembly of Gold(I) Complexes by Multiple Kinetic Aggregation States with Nonlinear Optical and Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the preparation of AuI self&#8208;assembled structures by controlling the equilibrium among multiple kinetic traps. Multiple kinetic traps are important in influencing its supramolecular chirality transfer process. Moreover, the achiral and chiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies showed interesting photonic properties, including optical waveguides, strong emission polarization and non&#8208;linear optical functionalities.







Abstract
Introduction of multiple kinetic aggregation states (Aggs) into the self&#8208;assembly pathway could bring complexity and flexibility to the self&#8208;assemblies, which is difficult to realize due to the delicate equilibria established among different Aggs bonded by weak noncovalent interactions. Here, we describe a series of chiral and achiral d10 AuI bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, NHC) complexes, and the achiral complex could undergo self&#8208;assembly with multiple kinetic Aggs. Generation of multiple kinetic Aggs was realized by applying chiral or achiral seeds exhibiting large differences in elongation temperatures for their respective cooperative self&#8208;assembly processes. We further showed that the chiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies having non&#8208;centrosymmetric packing forms exhibit nonlinear optical response of second harmonic generation (SHG), while the SHG signal is absent in the achiral analogue. The crystalline achiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies could function as optical waveguides with strong emission polarization.

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to Vinyl Cyclopropanes Enabled by Air&#8208;stable Palladium(I) Dimer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report showcases the stereospecific and modular synthesis of vinyl cyclopropanes in less than 30&#8197;min at room temperature, employing air&#8208;stable dinuclear PdI catalysis.







Abstract
While vinyl cyclopropanes are valuable functional groups in drugs or natural products as well as established precursors to trigger a rich variety of synthetic transformations, their reactive nature can make their installation via direct catalytic approaches challenging. We herein present a modular access to (di)vinyl cyclopropanes under very mild conditions and full conservation of stereochemistry, allowing access to the cis or trans cyclopropane&#8208; as well as E or Z vinyl&#8208;stereochemical relationships. Our protocol relies on air&#8208;stable dinuclear PdI catalysis, which enables rapid (&lt;30&#8197;min) and selective access to a diverse range of vinyl cyclopropane motifs at room temperature, even on gram scale.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic Cooperativity Through a Hydrogen Bonding Spacer in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the active site of CO dehydrogenase (CODH), a novel metalloporphyrin&#8208;based mimic has been synthesized combining a multipoint hydrogen bond donor and a bimetallic active centre. The cooperativity between the two metal centres of the catalyst was evidenced for both homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic analogues leading to a significant enhancement of the catalytic performances of the heterogeneous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction in water.







Abstract
At the core of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) active site two metal ions together with hydrogen bonding scheme from amino acids orchestrate the interconversion between CO2 and CO. We have designed a molecular catalyst implementing a bimetallic iron complex with an embarked second coordination sphere with multi&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. We found that, when immobilized on carbon paper electrode, the dinuclear catalyst enhances up to four fold the heterogeneous CO2 reduction to CO in water with an improved selectivity and stability compared to the mononuclear analogue. Interestingly, quasi&#8208;identical catalytic performances are obtained when one of the two iron centers was replaced by a redox inactive Zn metal, questioning the cooperative action of the two metals. Snapshots of X&#8208;ray structures indicate that the two metalloporphyrin units tethered by a urea group is a good compromise between rigidity and flexibility to accommodate CO2 capture, activation, and reduction.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Indium&#8208;Nickel Atomic Pair as Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites Enabling Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

An atomically dispersed heteronuclear dual&#8208;site catalyst with an axial oxygen atom bridged In&#8208;N6&#8208;Ni moiety anchored on nitrogenated carbon for InNi diatomic sites synergistically accelerating reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts offer a promising pathway for electrochemical CO2 conversion. However, it is still a challenge to optimize the electrochemical performance of dual&#8208;atom catalysts. Here, an atomic indium&#8208;nickel dual&#8208;sites catalyst bridged by an axial oxygen atom (O&#8208;In&#8208;N6&#8208;Ni moiety) was anchored on nitrogenated carbon (InNi DS/NC). InNi DS/NC exhibits superior CO selectivity with Faradaic efficiency higher than 90&#8201;% over a wide potential range from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;0.8&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). Moreover, an industrial CO partial current density up to 317.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE in a flow cell. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS combined with theory calculations reveal that the synergistic effect of In&#8208;Ni dual&#8208;sites and O atom bridge not only reduces the reaction barrier for the formation of *COOH, but also retards the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides a feasible strategy to construct dual&#8208;site catalysts towards energy conversion.

         <title>Anomalously Large Antiphase Signals from Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen Using a MOF&#8208;Based SABRE Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of parahydrogen to particles comprised of an iridium&#8208;based catalyst supported on a metal&#8211;organic framework produces dissolved orthohydrogen, but with a twist: a strongly hyperpolarized state is achieved that is enriched in the T0 sublevel, giving rise to a surprising anti&#8208;phase signal with enhancement up to &#8776;500&#8208;fold and significantly increased hyperpolarization lifetime.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized orthohydrogen (o&#8208;H2) is a frequent product of parahydrogen&#8208;based hyperpolarization approaches like signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE), where the hyperpolarized o&#8208;H2 signal is usually absorptive. We describe a novel manifestation of this effect wherein large antiphase o&#8208;H2 signals are observed, with 1H enhancements up to &#8776;500&#8208;fold (effective polarization PH&#8776;1.6&#8201;%). This anomalous effect is attained only when using an intact heterogeneous catalyst constructed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and is qualitatively independent of substrate nature. This seemingly paradoxical observation is analogous to the &#8220;partial negative line&#8221; (PNL) effect recently explained in the context of Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP) by Ivanov and co&#8208;workers. The two&#8208;spin order of the o&#8208;H2 resonance is manifested by a two&#8208;fold higher Rabi frequency, and the lifetime of the antiphase HP o&#8208;H2 resonance is extended by several&#8208;fold.

&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarized orthohydrogen (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a frequent product of parahydrogen-based hyperpolarization approaches like signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE), where the hyperpolarized &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signal is usually absorptive. We describe a novel manifestation of this effect wherein large antiphase &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signals are observed, with &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H enhancements up to &#8776;500-fold (effective polarization &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;1.6&#8201;%). This anomalous effect is attained only when using an intact heterogeneous catalyst constructed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and is qualitatively independent of substrate nature. This seemingly paradoxical observation is analogous to the &#8220;partial negative line&#8221; (PNL) effect recently explained in the context of Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP) by Ivanov and co-workers. The two-spin order of the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resonance is manifested by a two-fold higher Rabi frequency, and the lifetime of the antiphase HP &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resonance is extended by several-fold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Melt&#8208;Quenched Luminescent Glass of an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Manganese Halide as a Large&#8208;Area Scintillator for Radiation Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zero&#8208;dimensional manganese&#8208;based metal halide capable of forming a stable melt is reported. Large&#8208;area luminescent metal halide glasses can be conveniently synthesized by the melt&#8208;quenching method and used as scintillators for radiation detection.







Abstract
Glass is a group of materials with appealing qualities, including simplicity in fabrication, durability, and high transparency, and they play a crucial role in the optics field. In this paper, a new organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide luminescent glass exhibiting &gt;78&#8201;% transmittance at 506&#8211;800&#8197;nm range together with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 28.5&#8201;% is reported through a low&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;quenching approach of pre&#8208;synthesized (HTPP)2MnBr4 (HTPP=hexyltriphenylphosphonium) single crystal. Temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, polarizing microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were combined to investigate the glass&#8208;crystal interconversion process, revealing the disordered nature of the glassy state. Benefiting from the transparent nature, (HTPP)2MnBr4 glass yields an outstanding spatial resolution of 10&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. The superb optical properties and facility of large&#8208;scale fabrication distinguish the organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide glass as a highly promising class of materials for optical devices.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Cross&#8208;Electrophile Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Couplings of Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a unified protocol for the regiodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two distinct alkyl bromides has been established, providing access to &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208;alkylated amides. This catalytic protocol relies on a good practical regiocontrol for installing alkyl groups and provides orthogonal access to diverse branched architectures with remote saturated carbon centers while starting from identical substrates.







Abstract
Functionalizing specific positions on a saturated alkyl molecule is a key challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent alkylations of alkyl bromides at different positions by Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with the second alkyl bromides has been developed. The reaction undergoes site&#8208;selective isomerization on one alkyl bromides in a controlled manner, providing switchable access to diverse alkylated structures at different sites of alkyl bromides. The reaction occurs at three similar positions with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, representing a remarkable ligand tuned reactivity between alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling and nickel migration along the hydrocarbon side chain. This reaction offers a catalytic platform to diverse saturated architectures by alkyl&#8208;alkyl bond&#8208;formation from identical starting materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Re&#8208;Organization Enables Polythiophene as an Extraordinary Cathode Material for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries with a Cycle Life of 100&#8201;000&#8197;Cycles</title>

         <dc:description>
A polythiophene (PT) with the ability of self&#8208;adaptive re&#8208;organization is used for the cathode of aluminum ion battery. The polymerization mode can change from C&#945;&#8722;C&#945; (&#945;&#8208;PT) to C&#946;&#8722;C&#946; (&#946;&#8208;PT) which makes the PT obtain fast kinetics and small steric hindrance. PT cathode achieves a high capacity and super long cycle life of 100&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have attracted great attentions in recent years. Organic materials such as polythiophene (PT) are promising cathode for AIBs. However, the capacity and cyclic stability of conventional organic cathode such as PT are limited by the inadequate degree of reaction and the unstable nature of organic materials. To obtain high&#8208;performance organic cathode, a new PT with the ability of self&#8208;adaptive re&#8208;organization was prepared. During cycling, its molecular chain can be re&#8208;organized, and the polymerization mode will change from C&#945;&#8722;C&#945; (&#945;&#8208;PT) to C&#946;&#8722;C&#946; (&#946;&#8208;PT). This change leads to smaller steric hindrance and faster kinetics during ion insertion which can lower the reaction energy barrier and stabilize the molecular structure. Benefited by this, AIBs with this cathode can deliver a specific capacity of 180&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (@2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a superb stability of 100&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. High energy density and power density can also be achieved with this cathode.

Variation in anion and cation structure upon changing from crystalline solid to glass to liquid dimeric lanthanide&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the preparation of liquid dimeric lanthanide(III)&#8208;containing compounds. Starting from the design of dimeric solids, we demonstrate that by tuning of anion and cation structures we can lower the melting points below room temperature, whilst maintaining the dimeric structure. Magnetic measurements could establish the spin&#8208;spin interactions of the neighboring lanthanide(III) ions in the liquid state at low temperatures, and matched the interactions of the analogous crystalline solid compounds.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Hydrogenation of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Lactams Enabled by Switching the N&#8208;Chirality of Iridium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central chirality is an important chiral element used in the design of chiral ligands and catalysts. Mostly, the attention of organic chemists is focused on the development of chiral ligands with stable stereogenic centers. However, the N&#8208;chirality in chiral ligand design has been ignored for long time due to its flexibility. Here we demonstrate that the design, synthesis and application of a class of simple P,N&#8208;ligands with flexible N&#8208;based stereogenic center and their derived iridium complexes with fixed N&#8208;based stereogenic center. Both fixed configurations of the N&#8208;stereocenter of the iridium complexes could be selectively formed from the same chiral ligand. This pair of diastereoisomeric iridium complexes showed good performance in the enantiodivergent asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated lactams. The N&#8208;based stereocenter plays an impressive role in enantio&#8208;inducing control. Computational studies emphasized the importance of N&#8208;chirality in the design/development of chiral ligands in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids by Manganese Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a straightforward synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid molecules via an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and primary alcohols. A bench&#8208;stable manganese complex catalyzed the reaction, which is scalable, with the product being isolated with high yields and selectivities under mild conditions. The protocol is environmentally benign, producing water and hydrogen gas as the only byproducts. Methanol can also be used as a C1 source for producing the platform molecule lactic acid, with a high turnover of &gt;104. The methodology was also used to functionalize alcohols derived from natural products and fatty acids. Furthermore, it was applied for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;amino acid, &#945;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acid, and several drugs and bioactive molecules, including endogenous metabolites, Danshensu, Enalapril, Lisinopril, and Rosmarinic acid. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed to shed light on the mechanism involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multifluorination Strategy Toward Wide Bandgap Polymers for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating new electron&#8208;deficient unit is highly demanded to develop high&#8208;performance polymer donors for non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we reported a multifluorinated unit 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluoronaphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithio&#8208;phene (FNT) and its polymers PFNT&#8208;F and PFNT&#8208;Cl. The advantages of multifluorination: (1) it enables the polymers to exhibit low&#8208;lying HOMO (~ &#8208;5.5 eV) and wide bandgap (~ 2.0 eV); (2) the short interactions (F&#183;&#183;&#183;H, F&#183;&#183;&#183;F) endow the polymers with properties of high film crystallinity and efficient hole transport; (3) well miscibility with NFAs that leads to a more well&#8208;defined nanofibrous morphology and face&#8208;on orientation in the blend films. Therefore, the PFNT&#8208;F/Cl:N3 based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53 % and 18.10 %, which make them ranked the best donor materials in OSCs. This work offers new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance polymers by multifluorination strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Evoke Pyroptosis for High&#8208;Efficiency Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been applied in various tumor therapies, the intrinsic immunogenicity remains unclear. Here, we initiatively discover that ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (NPs) can intrinsically induce pyroptosis by a caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;dependent pathway. The pyroptotic cell death is accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD) simultaneously for efficient in situ immunity initiation. Meanwhile, carbonyl cyanide m&#8208;chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial depolarizing agent, is successfully loaded into ZIF&#8208;8 NPs and found to further enhance the pyroptosis process. Collectively, the obtained Pluronic F127&#8208;modified CCCP&#8208;incorporated ZIF&#8208;8 NPs (F127ZIF&#8208;8CCCP NPs) activate antitumor immunity and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), realizing high&#8208;efficiency tumor growth inhibition. This work will facilitate biomedicine applications of ZIF&#8208;8 and provide good inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;induced cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Ni/V2O3 Heterostructure Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline fuel cells can permit the adoption of platinum group metal&#8208;free (PGM&#8208;free) catalysts and cheap bipolar plates, thus further lowering the cost. With the exploration of PGM&#8208;free hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts, nickel&#8208;based compounds have been considered as the most promising HOR catalysts in alkali. Here we report an interfacial engineering through the formation of nickel&#8208;vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) heterostructures to activate Ni for efficient HOR catalysis in alkali. The strong electron transfer from Ni to V2O3 could modulate the electronic structure of Ni sites. The optimal Ni/V2O3 catalyst exhibits a high intrinsic activity of 0.038 mA cm&#8208;2 and outstanding stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni/V2O3 interface as the active sites can enable to optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable activity and durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Receptors with&#160;Micromolar Affinity for Chloride in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A water&#8208;soluble coordination cage was obtained by reaction of Pd(NO3)2 with a 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligand featuring a short PEG chain. The cavity of the metal&#8208;organic cage contains one nitrate anion, which is readily replaced by chloride. The apparent association constant for chloride binding in buffered aqueous solution is Ka = 1.8(&#177;0.1)&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#160;M&#8211;1. This value is significantly higher than what has been reported for other macrocyclic chloride receptors. The heavier halides Br&#8211; and I&#8211; compete with binding or self&#8208;assembly, but the receptor displays very good selectivity over common anions such as phosphate, acetate, carbonate, and sulfate. A further increase of the chloride binding affinity by a factor of 3 was achieved using a fluorinated dipyridyl ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Formal Double C&#8211;H Oxidation of Prenylated Molecules to Alkylidene Oxetanes and Azetidines by Strain&#8208;Enabled Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prenylation is a ubiquitous late&#8208;stage modification in nature that often confers significantly improved bioactivity for secondary metabolites. While this lipophilic modification renders enhanced potency, the lipophilic tag(s) can diminish bioavailability and adversely alter drug transportation and metabolism. Thus, a functional group tolerant, mild, and selective late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization of prenyl tags would present a great potential in drug discovery programs but could also impact other fields, such as agrochemistry and chemical biology. Herein we report an exocyclic strain driven cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of prenyl tags, a formal double C&#8211;H oxidation protocol, that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This methodology avoids the need of pre&#8208;functionalization of target molecules and affords an easy access to an unprecedented library of oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;prenylated complex molecules. Thus, in a broader context, this methodology extends late&#8208;stage functionalization beyond that available to nature</dc:description>

We herein present proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments at 100&#160;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning and at high static magnetic&#8208;field strengths (28.8&#160;T) enabling the detection of a single water molecule fixed in the calix[4]arene cavity of a lanthanide complex by a combination of three types of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The water proton resonances are detected at a chemical&#8208;shift value close to zero ppm, which we further confirm by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Density Functional Theory calculations pinpoint to the sensitivity of the proton chemical&#8208;shift value for hydrogen&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our study highlights how proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR is turning into the method&#8208;of&#8208;choice in probing weak non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events in chemistry and biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic Borromean Rings and [2]Catenanes Featuring Di&#8208;NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a series of organometallic Borromean rings (BRs) and [2]catenanes prepared from benzobiscarbene ligands. The reaction of dinickel complexes of the benzobiscarbenes 1a&#8210;1c with a thiazolothiazole bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 led by self&#8208;assembly to a series of organometallic BRs. Solvophobic effects played a crucial role in the formation and stability of the interlocked species. The stability of BRs is related to the N&#8208;alkyl substituents at the precursors 1a&#8210;1c, where longer alkyl substitutes improve stability and inter&#8208;ring interactions. Solvophobic effects are also important for the stability of [2]catenanes prepared from 1a&#8210;1c and a flexible bipyridyl ligand L3. In solution, an equilibrium between the [2]catenanes and their macrocyclic building blocks was observed. High proportions of [2]catenanes were obtained in concentrated solutions or polar solvents. The proportion of [2]catenanes in solution could be further enhanced by lengthening of the N&#8208;alkyl substitutes.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Bacterial Adenosine&#8208;Derived Nucleoside as an Example of RNA Modification Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fields of RNA modification and RNA damage both exhibit a plethora of non&#8208;canonical nucleoside structures. While RNA modifications have evolved to improve RNA function, the term RNA damage implies detrimental effects. Based on stable isotope labelling and mass spectrometry, we report the identification and characterisation of 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenosine (ms2&#949;A), which is related to 1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenine, a lesion resulting from exposure of nucleic acids to alkylating chemicals in vivo. In contrast, a sophisticated isoprene labelling scheme revealed that ms2eA biogenesis involves cleavage of a prenyl moiety in the known transfer RNA (tRNA) modification 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (ms2i6A). The relative abundance of ms2&#949;A in tRNAs from translating ribosomes suggests reduced function in comparison to its parent RNA modification, establishing the nature of the new structure in a newly perceived overlap of the two previously separate fields, namely an RNA modification damage.</dc:description>

         <title>Speed Tuning of Formation/Dissociation of a Metallorotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switching between the formation/dissociation of rotaxanes is important in order to control the function of various types of rotaxane&#8208;based materials. We developed a convenient and simple strategy, the so&#8208;called &#8220;accelerator addition&#8221;, to make a static rotaxane dynamic without apparently affecting the chemical structure. As an interlocked molecule that enables tuning of the formation/dissociation speed, a metallorotaxane was quantitatively generated&#160;by the complexation of a triptycene&#8208;based dumbbell&#8208;shaped mononuclear complex, [PdL2]2+ (L = 2,3&#8208;diaminotriptycene), with 27C9. Due to the inertness of the Pd2+&#8208;based coordination structure, the metallorotaxane was slowly formed (the static state). This rotaxane formation was accelerated 27 times simply by adding Br&#8211; as an accelerator (the dynamic state). A similar drastic acceleration was also demonstrated during the dissociation process when Cs+ was added to the metallorotaxane to form the free axle [PdL2]2+ and the 27C9&#8211;Cs+ complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Biological Activities of Antifungal Agents with Chemical Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing number of fungal infections caused by pathogens resistant to one or more classes of antifungal drugs emphasizes the threat that these microorganisms pose to animal and human health and global food security. Open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of action of the limited repertoire of antifungal agents, making it challenging to rationally develop more efficacious therapeutics. In recent years, the use of chemical biology approaches has resolved some of these questions and has provided new promising concepts to guide the design of antifungal agents. By focusing on examples from studies carried out in recent years, this minireview describes the key roles that probes based on antifungal agents and their derivatives have played in uncovering details about their activities, in detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between these agents and their targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Isomeric Naphthalene&#8208;Based 2D Kagome Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted synthesis of kagome (kgm) topologic 2D covalent organic frameworks remains challenging, presumably due to the severe dependence on building units and synthetic conditions. Herein, two isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different lengths of substituted arms based on naphthalene core (p&#8208;Naph and m&#8208;Naph) are elaborately designed and utilized for the defined synthesis of isomeric kgm Naph&#8208;COFs. The two isomeric frameworks exhibit splendid crystallinity and showcase the same chemical composition and topologic structure with, however, different pore channels. Interestingly, C60 is able to uniformly be infiltrated into the triangle channels of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF via in&#8208;situ incorporation method, while not the isomeric p&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, likely due to the different pore structures of the two isomeric COFs. The resulting stable C60@m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF composite exhibits much higher photoconductivity than the m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF owing to charge transfer between the conjugated skeletons and C60 guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Switching of CO2 Hydrogenation Pathway towards CH3OH Production over Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Co)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly desired to achieve controllable product selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. Herein, we report light&#8208;induced switching of reaction pathways of CO2 hydrogenation towards CH3OH production over actomically dispersed Co decorated Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. CO, being the main product in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) pathway under thermocatalysis condition, is switched to CH3OH via the formate pathway with the assistance of light irradiation. Impressively, the space&#8208;time yield of CH3OH in photo&#8208;assisted thermocatalysis (1916.3 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) is about 7.8 times higher than that without light at 240 &#176;C and 1.5 MPa. Mechanism investigation indicates that upon light irradiation, excited UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can transfer electrons to Pt nanoparticles and Co sites, which can efficiently catalyze the critical elementary steps (i.e., CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*HCOO conversion), thus suppressing the RWGS pathway to achieve a high CH3OH selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fundamental Understanding&#160;of Electronic Structure in FeN4 Site on Electrocatalytic Activity via&#160;dz2&#8208;Orbital Driven Charge Tuning&#160;for Acidic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural diversities of active sites in the traditional pyrolysis regularly restricted the fundamental understanding of the local coordination environment (LCE) around the active sites on their oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction (ORR) performance. Herein, we create a series of FeN4&#160;active&#8208;site configurations with clear LCE based on initial covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;polymers (COPs)&#8208;based paradigm catalysts via pyrolysis&#8208;free approach. Our results suggest that&#160;more positive charges were carried by iron atoms around electron&#8208;withdrawing side&#8208;chain thus forming the active high&#8208;valence configuration (FeH+N4) in&#160;COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs&#160;catalyst under&#160;dz2&#8208;orbital regulation. A new descriptor&#160;&#958;, defined as the band center of iron atoms projected on the&#160;3dz2&#8208;orbital, was&#160;innovatively introduced&#160;and quantitively explains emerged volcano&#8208;like regulation mechanism.&#160;When &#958;&#160;is distributed between &#8208;1.887 and &#8208;1.862 eV, catalytic performance of COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs electrocatalysts reaches optimal.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Potent and Exquisitely Selective Inhibitors of Kinase CK1 with Tunable Isoform Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Casein kinases 1 (CK1) are key signaling molecules that have emerged recently as attractive therapeutic targets in particular for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Herein, we report the identification of a new class of potent and highly selective inhibitors of CK1&#945;, &#948; and &#949;. Based on their optimal in vitro and in vivo profiles and their exclusive selectivity, MU1250, MU1500 and MU1742 were selected as quality chemical probes for those CK1 isoforms. At proper concentrations, MU1250 and MU1500 allow for specific targeting of CK1&#948; or dual inhibition of CK1&#948;/&#949; in cells. The compound MU1742 also efficiently inhibits CK1&#945; and, to our knowledge, represents the first potent and highly selective inhibitor of this enzyme. In addition, we demonstrate that the central 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;imidazole pharmacophore can be used as the basis of highly selective inhibitors of other therapeutically relevant protein kinases, e.g. p38&#945;, as exemplified by the compound MU1299.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of FeIV=O and its Contribution to Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions on a Single&#8208;Atom Iron&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generating FeIV=O on single&#8208;atom catalysts by Fenton&#8208;like reaction has been established for water treatment; however, its generation pathway and oxidation behavior remain obscure. Here, using a Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with typical Fe&#8211;N4 moiety to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS), we demonstrate that generating FeIV=O is mediated by the first&#8208;formed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;PMS* complex, a well&#8208;recognized nonradical species inducing electron&#8208;transfer oxidation, and determined by the adjacent Fe sites with specific Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance. After the Fe atoms with Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance &lt;4 &#197; are PMS&#8208;saturated, Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;PMS* formed on those with Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance of 4&#8211;5 &#197; can coordinate with the adjacent FeII&#8211;N4, forming an inter&#8208;complex with enhanced charge transfer to produce FeIV=O. FeIV=O enables the Fenton&#8208;like system to efficiently oxidize various pollutants in a substrate&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;tolerated and sustainable manner, where its prominent contribution manifests for the pollutants with higher one&#8208;electron oxidation potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Adduct of Atomic P(&#8208;1) as a Source of Phosphinidenes (PR), Diphosphorus (P2), and Indium Phosphide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report phosphinidenes (PR) stabilized by an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelate. These adducts include the parent phosphinidene, PH, which is accessed via thermolysis of coordinated HPCO. The reported FLP&#8208;PH species acts as a springboard to other phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds, such as FLP&#8208;adducts of diphosphorus (P2) and InP3. Our new adducts participate in thermal&#8208; or light&#8208;induced phosphinidene elimination (of both PH and PR, R = organic group), transfer P2 units to organic substrates, and yield the useful semiconductor InP at only 110 &#176;C from solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nickel on Carbon Nitride Photocatalyst Achieves Semihydrogenation of Alkynes with Water Protons via Monovalent Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prospect in light&#8208;driven water activation prompts rapid progress in hydrogenation reactions. Herein we describe the Ni2+&#8211;N4 site built on carbon nitride catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes with water supplying protons powered by visible irradiation. Importantly, the photocatalytic approach developed here enabled access to diverse deuterated alkenes in D2O with excellent deuterium incorporation. Under visible irradiation, a water&#8208;participated evolution of four&#8208;coordinated Ni2+ to three&#8208;coordinated Ni+ was spectroscopically identified. In combination with theoretical calculation, the photo&#8208;evolved Ni+ was suggested to be HO&#8211;Ni+&#8211;N2 with an uncoordinated, protonated pyridinic nitrogen formed by coupled Ni2+ reduction&#8208;water dissociation and conducted semihydrogenation. The paired Ni&#8211;N not only prompts hydrogen liberation from water, also renders preferred desorption of alkene over further hydrogenation to alkane, ensuring excellent semihydrogenation selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocrystallization Regulation Enabled&#160;Stacked Hexagonal Platelet Growth toward Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing durative flattened and dendrite&#8208;free zinc (Zn) metal configuration is the key to resolving premature battery failure caused by the internal short circuit, which is highly determined by the crystal growth in the electrocrystallization process. Herein, we report that regulating the molecular structure of the inner Helmholtz plane (HIP) can effectively convert the deposition into activation control by weakening the solvated ion adsorption at the interface. The moderated electrochemical reaction kinetics lower than the adatom self&#8208;diffusion rate steers conformal stratiform Zn growth and dominant Zn (0001) texture, achieving crystallographic optimization. Through in&#8208;situ mediation of electrolyte engineering, orientational plating and stripping behaviors at edge&#8208;sites and tailored solvation structure immensely improve the utilization efficiency and total charge passed of Zn metal, even under extreme conditions, including high areal capacity (3 mAh cm&#8208;2) and wide temperature range (&#8208;40~60 &#176;C).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To conquer the bottleneck of sluggish kinetics in cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of metal&#8211;air batteries, catalysts with dual&#8208;active centers have stood out. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is firstly conceived to fabricate a N,S&#8208;dual doped honeycomb&#8208;like carbon matrix inlaid with CoN4 sites and wrapped Co2P nanoclusters as dual&#8208;active centers (Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500).&#160;&#160;A crystalline {CoII2} coordination cluster divided by periphery second organic layers is well&#8208;designed to realize delocalized dispersion before calcination. The optimal Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500 executes excellent 4e&#8722; ORR activity surpassing the benchmark Pt/C.&#160;Theoretical calculation results reveal that the CoN4 sites and Co2P nanoclusters can synergistically quicken the formation of *OOH on Co sites. The rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) assembled by Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500 delivers ultralong cycling stability over 1742 hours (3484 cycles) under 5 mA cm&#8208;2 and can light up a 2.4 V LED bulb for ~264 hours, evidencing the promising practical application potentials in portable devices.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemistry of the Cyaphide Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We review the known chemistry of the cyaphide ion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;. This remarkable diatomic anion has been the subject of study since the late nineteenth century, however its isolation and characterization eluded chemists for almost a hundred years. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore the pioneering and synthetic experiments that first allowed for its isolation, as well as more recent developments demonstrating that cyaphide transfer is viable in well&#8208;established salt&#8208;metathesis protocols. The physical properties of the cyaphide ion are also explored in depth, allowing us to compare and contrast the chemistry of this ion with that of its lighter congener cyanide (an archetypal strong field ligand and important organic functional group). Recent studies show that the cyaphide ion has the potential to be used as a versatile chemical regent for the synthesis of novel molecules and materials hinting at many interesting future avenues of investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multistate Structural Switching of [3]Catenanes with Cyclic Porphyrin Dimers by Complexation with Amine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catenanes with multistate switchable properties are promising components for next&#8208;generation molecular machines and supramolecular materials. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled switching method, a novel method for the multistate switching of catenanes controlled by complexation with added amine ligands. To verify this method, a [3]catenane comprising cyclic porphyrin dimers with a rigid p&#8208;system is synthesized. Owing to their rigidity, the relative positions among the cyclic components of the [3]catenane can be precisely controlled by complexation with various amine ligands. Moreover, ligand&#8208;controlled multistate switching affects the optical properties of the [3]catenanes; the emission intensity can be tuned by modulating the sizes and coordination numbers of integrated amine ligands. This work shows the utility of using organic ligands for structural switching of catenanes, and will contribute to the further development of multistate switchable mechanically interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks as Gas Diffusion Layers for Multi&#8208;atmosphere Lithium&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8208;air batteries, despite their high energy density and low cost, have not been deployed practically due to their instability in ambient air, where moisture causes parasitic reactions and shortens their life drastically. Here, we demonstrate the rational design of nanoporous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as effective gas diffusion layers (GDLs) to address this constraint. The COF GDLs, with a tailor&#8208;made pore size of ~1.4 nm and superhydrophobicity can limit the intrusion of organic electrolytes and moisture into the gas diffusion channels, enabling high capacity, fast kinetics, and excellent stability of the Li&#8208;air batteries. Moreover, we achieve multi&#8208;atmosphere Li&#8208;air batteries, which can stably cycle under open ambient air (relative humidity up to 95%) and even in various atmospheres with looping oxygen, humid air, and carbon dioxide. The design principles of our COF GDLs can be universally applied in energy storage and electrochemical systems using organic electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation and Improvement of the Stability of Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based Solid&#8208;state Batteries with High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathode active materials (CAMs) such as LiNi1&#8208; x &#8208; y Co x Mn y O2 (NCM) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) suffer from &#8220;noisy voltage&#8221; related cell failure. Moreover, reports on their long&#8208;term cycling performance with high&#8208;voltage CAMs are not consistent. In this work, we verified that the penetration of lithium dendrites through the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) indeed causes such &#8220;noisy voltage cell failure&#8221;. This problem can be overcome by a simple modification of the SPE using higher molecular weight PEO, resulting in an improved cycling stability compared to lower molecular weight PEO. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirms the formation of oxidative degradation products after cycling with NCM, for what Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is not suitable as an analytical technique due to its limited surface sensitivity. Overall, our results help to critically evaluate and improve the stability of PEO&#8208;based SSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Energy Storage Devices: Novel Benzothiadiazole Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Olefin&#8208;Linked COFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials for energy storage applications exhibiting enhanced electrochemical performance. While most of the reported organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries use carbonyl groups as electrochemically&#8208;active sites, their high hydrophilicity in aqueous electrolytes represents a critical drawback. Herein, we report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT synthesized via the aldol condensation between 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TMT) and 4,4'&#8208;(benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)dibenzaldehyde (BT), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT exhibits an outstanding Zn2+&#160;storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.1 A g&#8208;1. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the charge&#8208;storage mechanism in COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT electrodes is based on the supramolecularly engineered and reversible Zn2+&#160;coordination by the benzothiadiazole units.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aromatic oligoamide sequences programmed to fold into stable helical conformations were designed to display a linear array of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors at their surface. Sequences were synthesized on solid phase synthesis. Solution 1H NMR spectroscopic studies and solid state crystallographic structures demonstrated the formation of stable hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated dimeric helix bundles that could be either heterochiral (with a P and an M helix) or homochiral (with two P or two M helices). Formation of the hetero&#8208; or homochiral dimers could be driven quantitatively using different chlorinated solvents &#8211; exemplifying a remarkable case of either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting or upon imposing absolute handedness to the helices to forbid PM species.</dc:description>

         <title>Oral Anticancer Heterobimetallic PtIV&#8208;AuI Complexes Show High In Vivo Activity and Low Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AuI&#8208;carbene and PtIV&#8208;AuI&#8208;carbene prodrugs display low to sub&#8208;mM activity against several cancer cell lines and overcome cisplatin (cisPt) resistance. Linking a cisPt&#8208;derived PtIV(phenylbutyrate) complex to a AuI&#8208;phenylimidazolylidene complex 2, yielded the most potent prodrug. While in vivo tests against Lewis Lung Carcinoma showed that the prodrug PtIV(phenylbutyrate)&#8208;AuI&#8208;carbene (7) and the 1:1:1 co&#8208;administration of cisPt: phenylbutyrate:2 efficiently inhibited tumor growth (~95%), much better than 2 (75%) or cispPt (84%), 7 exhibited only 5% body weight loss compared to 14% for 2, 20% for cisPt and &gt;30% for the co&#8208;administration. 7 was much more efficient than 2 at inhibiting TrxR activity in the isolated enzyme, in cells and in the tumor, even though it was much less efficient than 2 at binding to selenocysteine peptides modeling the active site of TrxR. Organ distribution and laser&#8208;ablation (LA)&#8208;ICP&#8208;TOFMS imaging suggest that 7 arrives intact at the tumor and is activated there.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Separation of Lithium, Magnesium and Calcium using 4&#8208;Phosphoryl Pyrazolones as pH&#8208;Regulated Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ensuring continuous and sustainable lithium supply requires the development of highly efficient separation processes such as LLE (liquid&#8208;liquid extraction) for both primary sources and certain waste streams. In this work, 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones are used in an efficient pH&#8208;controlled stepwise separation of Li+ from Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+. The factors affecting LLE process, such as the substitution pattern of the extractant, diluent/water distribution, co&#8208;ligand, pH, and speciation of the metal complexes involved, were systematically investigated. The maximum extraction efficiency of Li+ at pH 6.0 was 94% when Mg2+ and Ca2+ were previously separated at pH &lt; 5.0, proving that the separation of these ions is possible by simply modulating the pH of the aqueous phase. Our study points a way to separation of lithium from acid brine or from spent lithium ion battery leaching solutions, which supports the future supply of lithium in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited State Absorption Upconversion Induced by Structural Defects for Photocatalysis with a Breakthrough Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decade, great progresses have been gained for up&#8208;conversion materials. However, there are still shortcomings in quantum efficiency, excitation and emission ranges and the cost of the materials. Herein, a new excited state absorption (ESA) up&#8208;conversion mode is discovered, which is directly induced by structural defects, showing distinct chemical characteristics from those based on lanthanide ions and triplet states chromophores. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept model, the abundant N2C vacancies in graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets work as the crucial intermediate excitation states, which lead to graphitic carbon nitride up&#8208;conversely emitting the light at the wavelength of 436 nm excited by the light with the wavelength larger than 800 nm. This process is proven to proceed via a two&#8208;photon involved ESA mode with a breakthrough quantum efficiency of 0.64%. Moreover, compared with most classic up&#8208;conversion materials, graphitic carbon nitride features easy preparation, low cost and low toxicity. Further, we combine N2C vacancies enriched graphitic carbon nitride with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts such as In2S3 and CdS, and successfully achieved an infrared light driven photocatalytic reactions. These findings offered a new family of up&#8208;conversion materials; more semiconductors with various structural defects are potential complementary members.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating between Acidic and Basic Surface Hydroxyls on Metal Oxides by Fluoride Substitution: A Case Study on Blue TiO2&#160;from Laser Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. &#160;Herein, we prepare two series of TiO&#173;2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser&#8208;generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near&#8208;surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activated carbon catalyst having weak acid sites hydrolyzes chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides selectively in the presence of mechanical milling. Our system preferentially cleaves large molecules over small oligomers, thus maximizing the selectivity and yield of chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides. The product mixture is a promising plant biostimulant for environmentally friendly agriculture.







Abstract
Oligosaccharides possess fascinating functions that are applicable in a variety of fields, such as agriculture. However, the selective synthesis of oligosaccharides, especially chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides, has remained a challenge. Chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides activate the plant immune system, enabling crops to withstand pathogens without harmful agrichemicals. Here, we demonstrate the conversion of chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides using a carbon catalyst with weak acid sites and mechanical milling. The catalyst produces chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides with up to 94&#8201;% selectivity in good yields. Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations indicate that our system preferentially hydrolyzes larger chitin molecules over oligomers, thus providing the desired high selectivity. This unique kinetics is in contrast to the fact that typical catalytic systems rapidly hydrolyze oligomers to monomers. Unlike other materials carbons more strongly adsorb large polysaccharides than small oligomers, which is suitable for the selective synthesis of small oligosaccharides.

         <title>Decorating Single&#8208;Atomic Mn Sites with FeMn Clusters to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coexisting single&#8208;atomic Mn and FeMn atomic clusters sites have been fabricated by the innovative combination of post&#8208;adsorption and secondary pyrolysis approach. This material has been demonstrated theoretically to be conducive to the adsorption of molecular O2 and the cleavage of O&#8722;O bond during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process, thus improving the intrinsic ORR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The regulation of electron distribution of single&#8208;atomic metal sites by atomic clusters is an effective strategy to boost their intrinsic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

&lt;p&gt;Coexisting single-atomic Mn and FeMn atomic clusters sites have been fabricated by the innovative combination of post-adsorption and secondary pyrolysis approach. This material has been demonstrated theoretically to be conducive to the adsorption of molecular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the cleavage of O&#8722;O bond during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process, thus improving the intrinsic ORR activity and selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation of electron distribution of single-atomic metal sites by atomic clusters is an effective strategy to boost their intrinsic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein we report the construction of single-atomic Mn sites decorated with atomic clusters by an innovative combination of post-adsorption and secondary pyrolysis. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of Mn sites via Mn-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordination bonding to FeMn atomic clusters (FeMn&lt;sub&gt;ac&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C), which has been demonstrated theoretically to be conducive to the adsorption of molecular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the break of O&#8722;O bond during the ORR process. Benefiting from the structural features above, the FeMn&lt;sub&gt;ac&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with half-wave potential of 0.79&#8197;V in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.90&#8197;V in 0.1&#8197;M KOH as well as preeminent Zn-air battery performance. Such synthetic strategy may open up a route to construct highly active catalysts with tunable atomic structures for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dynamic Supramolecular H&#8208;bonding Network with Orthogonally Tunable Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic synergy strategy provides a novel example of supramolecular dual&#8208;tunable clusteroluminescence. The unique &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation endows materials with efficient luminescence as well as mechanical adaptivity and robustness. Moreover, dual dynamic polymeric networks provide an ideal platform for the orthogonal regulation of clusteroluminescence and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling.







Abstract
Enabling dynamically tunable emissive systems offers opportunities for constructing smart materials. Clusteroluminescence, as unconventional luminescence, has attracted increasing attention in both fundamental and applied sciences. Herein, we report a supramolecular poly(disulfides) network with tunable clusteroluminescence. The reticular H&#8208;bonds synergize the rigidity and mobility of dynamic networks, and endow the resulting materials with mechanical adaptivity and robustness, simultaneously enabling efficient clusteroluminescence and phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. Orthogonally tunable luminescence are achieved in two manners, i.e., slow backbone disulfide exchange and fast side&#8208;chain metal coordination. Further exploration of the reprocessability and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of intrinsic dynamic networks for sustainable materials is feasible. We foresee that the synergistic strategy of dynamic chemistry offers a novel pathway and potential opportunities for smart emissive materials.

         <title>A Ferroelectric Aminophosphonium Cyanoferrate with a Large Electrostrictive Coefficient as a Piezoelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric Iron (III) cyanometallate complex stabilized by organo&#8208;aminophosphonium cations was synthesized and utilized for efficient piezoelectric energy harvesting and storage applications.







Abstract
Hybrid materials possessing piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric properties emerge as excellent alternatives to conventional piezoceramics due to their merits of facile synthesis, lightweight nature, ease of fabrication and mechanical flexibility. Inspired by the structural stability of aminophosphonium compounds, here we report the first A3BX6 type cyanometallate [Ph2(iPrNH)2P]3[Fe(CN)6] (1), which shows a ferroelectric saturation polarization (Ps) of 3.71&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Compound 1 exhibits a high electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.73&#8197;m4&#8197;C&#8722;2, far exceeding those of piezoceramics (0.034&#8211;0.096&#8197;m4&#8197;C&#8722;2). Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) analysis demonstrates the polarization switching and domain structure of 1 further confirming its ferroelectric nature. Furthermore, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer composite films of 1 were prepared and employed as piezoelectric nanogenerators. Notably, the 15&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1&#8208;TPU device gave a maximum output voltage of 13.57&#8197;V and a power density of 6.03&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Pd0&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Carbonitratation Reaction Featuring an H&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Driven Alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 Reductive Elimination</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd0&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonitratation reaction between (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,6&#8208;diene and AgNO3 has been developed with the use of [PyH][BF4] as H&#8208;bonding donor under the toluene/H2O biphasic conditions, which provides a complementary method towards alkyl nitrates with high enantioselectivity. Experimental studies suggest a reaction mechanism involving an H&#8208;bonding&#8208;driven SN2&#8208;type alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 reductive elimination.







Abstract
Reductive elimination of alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;O is a synthetically useful yet underdeveloped elementary reaction. Here we report that the combination of an H&#8208;bonding donor [PyH][BF4] and AgNO3 additive under toluene/H2O biphasic system can enable such elementary step to form alkyl nitrate. This results in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonitratations of (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,6&#8208;dienes with (R)&#8208;BINAP as the chiral ligand, affording alkyl nitrates up to 96&#8201;% ee. Mechanistic studies disclose that the reaction consists of oxidative addition of Pd0 catalyst to vinyl iodide, anion ligand exchange between I&#8722; and NO3&#8722;, alkene insertion and SN2&#8208;type alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 reductive elimination. Evidences suggest that H&#8208;bonding interaction of PyH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;ONO2 can facilitate dissociation of O2NO&#8722; ligand from the alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 species, thus enabling the challenging alkyl&#8722;PdII&#8722;ONO2 reductive elimination to be feasible.

         <title>The Role of Cytochrome&#8197;P450 AbyV in the Final Stages of Abyssomicin&#8197;C Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme AbyV catalyses a key epoxidation in the final stages of the biosynthesis of the spirotetronate antibiotic abyssomicin&#8197;C. Combining structural and computational data with a 13C labelling strategy was found to be a powerful approach to interrogate the biotransformation and determine the precise function of the enzyme.







Abstract
Abyssomicin&#8197;C and its atropisomer are potent inhibitors of bacterial folate metabolism. They possess complex polycyclic structures, and their biosynthesis has been shown to involve several unusual enzymatic transformations. Using a combination of synthesis and in vitro assays we reveal that AbyV, a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme from the aby gene cluster, catalyses a key late&#8208;stage epoxidation required for the installation of the characteristic ether&#8208;bridged core of abyssomicin&#8197;C. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of AbyV has been determined, which in combination with molecular dynamics simulations provides a structural framework for our functional data.

&lt;p&gt;The cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme AbyV catalyses a key epoxidation in the final stages of the biosynthesis of the spirotetronate antibiotic abyssomicin&#8197;C. Combining structural and computational data with a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labelling strategy was found to be a powerful approach to interrogate the biotransformation and determine the precise function of the enzyme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abyssomicin&#8197;C and its atropisomer are potent inhibitors of bacterial folate metabolism. They possess complex polycyclic structures, and their biosynthesis has been shown to involve several unusual enzymatic transformations. Using a combination of synthesis and in vitro assays we reveal that AbyV, a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme from the &lt;i&gt;aby&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster, catalyses a key late-stage epoxidation required for the installation of the characteristic ether-bridged core of abyssomicin&#8197;C. The X-ray crystal structure of AbyV has been determined, which in combination with molecular dynamics simulations provides a structural framework for our functional data. This work demonstrates the power of combining selective carbon-13 labelling with NMR spectroscopy as a sensitive tool to interrogate enzyme-catalysed reactions in vitro with no need for purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Taming Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters via Remote H&#8208;Bonding Stereoinduction in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropenes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were reported. Various chiral five&#8208;membered oxa&#8208; and aza&#8208;heterocycles were produced, and good yields and high stereoselectivities were obtained. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through H&#8208;bonding from chiral ligands.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening transformations of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes enable the rapid assembly of complex molecules. However, the enantioselective formation of chiral quaternary stereocenters using substrates bearing two different acceptors remains a challenge. Herein, we describe the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition of vinyl cyclopropanes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, a subset of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through hydrogen bond from chiral ligands, which thereby addressed the aforementioned challenge. A variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocycles were produced in good yields and with high stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yields, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er and &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and theoretical calculations, revealed the origin of the stereoselectivity and the importance of H&#8208;bonding in stereocontrol.

         <title>Heterogenization of Salen Metal Molecular Catalysts in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is reported. Co/Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is superior to the previously reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based COF photocatalysts







Abstract
Integrating a molecular catalyst with a light harvester into a photocatalyst is an effective strategy for solar light conversion. However, it is challenging to establish a crystallized framework with well&#8208;organized connections that favour charge separation and transfer. Herein, we report the heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The chemically conjugated bonds between the two units contribute to fast photogenerated electron transfer and thereby promote the proton reduction reaction. The Salen cobalt&#8208;based COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is superior to the previously reported nonnoble metal based COF photocatalysts. This work provides a strategy to construct atom&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by the heterogenization of molecular catalysts into covalent organic frameworks.

         <title>Chemoselective Decarboxylative Protonation Enabled by Cooperative Earth&#8208;Abundant Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining simple iron and thiol catalysts allows carboxylic acids to be directly converted to C&#8722;H bonds under visible light irradiation. The cocatalytic system exhibits a wide scope, is scalable, and preliminary mechanistic studies suggest it functions via a tandem ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mechanism.







Abstract
Decarboxylative protonation is a general deletion tactic to replace polar carboxylic acid groups with hydrogen or its isotope. Current methods rely on the pre&#8208;activation of acids, non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen sources, and/or expensive/highly oxidizing photocatalysts, presenting challenges to their wide adoption. Here we show that a cooperative iron/thiol catalyst system can readily achieve this transformation, hydrodecarboxylating a wide range of activated and unactivated carboxylic acids and overcoming scope limitations in previous direct methods. The reaction is readily scaled in batch configuration and can be directly performed in deuterated solvent to afford high yields of d&#8208;incorporated products with excellent isotope incorporation efficiency; characteristics not attainable in previous photocatalyzed approaches. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a radical mechanism and kinetic results of unactivated acids (KIE=1) are consistent with a light&#8208;limited reaction.

         <title>Enriching Surface&#8208;Accessible CO2 in the Zero&#8208;Gap Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor called the surface&#8208;accessible CO2 concentration ([CO2]SA) is developed, which enables to indicate the transient state of the local [CO2]/[OH&#8722;] ratio and helps define the limits of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Three general tactics are developed to enrich [CO2]SA for high current electrolysis: (1)&#8197;increasing the catalyst layer thickness, (2)&#8197;elevating CO2 pressure, and (3)&#8197;employing the pulse electrochemical method.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;gap anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based CO2 electrolysis is a promising technology for CO production, however, their performance at elevated current densities still suffers from the low local CO2 concentration due to heavy CO2 neutralization. Herein, via modulating the CO2 feed mode and quantitative analyzing CO2 utilization with the aid of mass transport modeling, we develop a descriptor denoted as the surface&#8208;accessible CO2 concentration ([CO2]SA), which enables us to indicate the transient state of the local [CO2]/[OH&#8722;] ratio and helps define the limits of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To enrich the [CO2]SA, we developed three general strategies: (1)&#8197;increasing catalyst layer thickness, (2)&#8197;elevating CO2 pressure, and (3)&#8197;applying a pulsed electrochemical (PE) method. Notably, an optimized PE method allows to keep the [CO2]SA at a high level by utilizing the dynamic balance period of CO2 neutralization. A maximum jCO of 368&#177;28&#8197;mA&#8201;cmgeo&#8722;2 was achieved using a commercial silver catalyst.

         <title>Structurally Defined Water&#8208;Soluble Metallofullerene Derivatives towards Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular metallobuckytrio (MBT) platform provides a family of structurally defined, water&#8208;soluble metallofullerene derivatives that can safely carry rare&#8208;earth elements in tailorable molecules, showing promise in biomedicines including MRI contrast agents and photosensitizers.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) are excellent carriers of rare&#8208;earth element (REE) ions in biomedical applications because they preclude the release of toxic metal ions. However, existing approaches to synthesize water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives yield mixtures that inhibit precise drug design. Here we report the synthesis of metallobuckytrio (MBT), a three&#8208;buckyball system, as a modular platform to develop structurally defined water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives with ligands by choice. Demonstrated with PEG ligands, the resulting water&#8208;soluble MBTs show superb biocompatibility. The Gd MBTs exhibit superior T1 relaxivity than typical Gd complexes, potentially superseding current clinical MRI contrast agents in both safety and efficiency. The Lu MBTs generated reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation, showing promise as photosensitizers. With their modular nature to incorporate other ligands, we anticipate the MBT platform to open new paths towards bio&#8208;specific REE drugs.

         <title>A Semi&#8208;solid Zinc Powder&#8208;based Slurry Anode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, for the first time, we design a semi&#8208;solid zinc slurry anode consisting of zinc powder and the intrinsically zincophilic tin additive dispersed in a conductive elastic rheological network. Experimental observations and theoretical simulations reveal that zinc can be deposited homogeneously on the dispersed tin particles, which avoids agglomerative zinc deposition and alleviates volume change during repeated zinc stripping/plating.







Abstract
The booming of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) draws the researchers&#8217; attention to issues of zinc metal anodes, such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, corrosion, and volume effects. Zinc powder anode is more suitable for the industrial application of AZIBs than the widely used zinc foil anode due to its low cost, tunability and processability. However, the related solutions are rarely studied because the above issues of zinc metal anode are more serious in zinc powder anode. Herein, for the first time, we design a semi&#8208;solid zinc slurry anode consisting of zinc powder and zincophilic tin additive dispersed in a conductive elastic rheological network. Zinc can be deposited homogeneously on the dispersed tin particles, which avoids agglomerative zinc deposition and alleviates volume change during repeated zinc stripping/plating. Moreover, the practical application of the full cell with slurry is very promising since its operating life can be easily extended by facile slurry renewal.

         <title>NaCdSb: An Orthorhombic Zintl Phase with Exceptional Intrinsic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance Zintl phase thermoelectric material NaCdSb has a peak figure of merit zT=1.3 at 673&#8197;K without any doping optimization or structural modification. This compound exhibits intrinsic semiconductor behavior, and the hole concentration approaches optimal as the temperature rises, leading to high power factors. The ultralow thermal conductivity is achieved through the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds.







Abstract
Many Zintl phases are promising thermoelectric materials owning to their features like narrow band gaps, multiband behaviors, ideal charge transport tunnels, and loosely bound cations. Herein we show a new Zintl phase NaCdSb with exceptional intrinsic thermoelectric performance. Pristine NaCdSb exhibits semiconductor behaviors with an experimental hole concentration of 2.9&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 and a calculated band gap of 0.5&#8197;eV. As the temperature increases, the hole concentration rises gradually and approaches its optimal one, leading to a high power factor of 11.56&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. The ultralow thermal conductivity is derived from the small phonon group velocity and short phonon lifetime, ascribed to the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds. As a consequence, a maximum zT of 1.3 at 673&#8197;K has been achieved without any doping optimization or structural modification, demonstrating that NaCdSb is a remarkable thermoelectric compound with great potential for performance improvement.

         <dc:description>
Through a newly developed Cu/CPA co&#8208;catalytic system, the direct hydrophosphinylation of alkynes with nucleophilic phosphine oxides was achieved to access novel axially chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing alkenes in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction pathway and the enantiocontrol model.

DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction pathway and the origin of enantiocontrol.

         <title>Maximum Impact of Ionic Strength on Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Rates Induced by a Zeolite Microporous Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confined hydronium ions in zeolite create an intraporous ionic environment, which increases acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction rates in a volcanic pattern at both saturated and low concentrations of substrates in the pores.







Abstract
The intracrystalline ionic environment in microporous zeolite can remarkably modify the excess chemical potential of adsorbed reactants and transition states, thereby influencing the catalytic turnover rates. However, a limit of the rate enhancement for aqueous&#8208;phase dehydration of alcohols appears to exist for zeolites with high ionic strength. The origin of such limitation has been hypothesized to be caused by the spatial constraints in the pores via, e.g., size exclusion effects. It is demonstrated here that the increase in turnover rate as well as the formation of a maximum and the rate drop are intrinsic consequences of the increasingly dense ionic environment in zeolite. The molecularly sized confines of zeolite create a unique ionic environment that monotonically favors the formation of alcohol&#8208;hydronium ion complexes in the micropores. The zeolite microporous environment determines the kinetics of catalytic steps and tailors the impact of ionic strength on catalytic rates.

         <title>Ammonia Synthesis at Room Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure from N2: A Boron&#8208;Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;centered radicals, generated by reduction of R2BCl derivatives, react with N2 all the way to borylamine formation. DFT calculations rationalize the reduction/functionalization process, involving N&#8722;N bond splitting. Hydrolysis of the mixture yields NH4+. Radical addition to N2 provides a new strategy for N2 fixation.







Abstract
Ammonia, NH3, is an essential molecule, being part of fertilizers. It is currently synthesized via the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, from the very stable dinitrogen molecule, N2 and dihydrogen, H2. This process requires high temperatures and pressures, thereby generating ca 1.6&#8201;% of the global CO2 emissions. Alternative strategies are needed to realize the functionalization of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions. Here, we show that boron&#8208;centered radicals provide a means of activating N2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure whilst allowing a radical process to occur, leading to the production of borylamines. Subsequent hydrolysis released NH4+, the acidic form of NH3. EPR spectroscopy supported the intermediacy of radicals in the process, corroborated by DFT calculations, which rationalized the mechanism of the N2 functionalization by R2B radicals.

         <title>Surface Water as an Initial Proton Source for the Electrochemical CO Reduction Reaction on Copper Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces was investigated with in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT). Direct spectroscopic evidence for surface *CO, Cu&#8722;Oad, and Cu&#8722;OHad species was observed and confirmed with isotopic experiments. Surface *H2O is the dominant proton source for the initial protonation steps in alkaline electrolytes (pH=13).







Abstract
We have employed in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces under various conditions. Coadsorbed and structure&#8208;/potential&#8208;dependent surface species, including *CO, Cu&#8722;Oad, and Cu&#8722;OHad, were identified using electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope labeling. The relative abundance of *OH follows a &#8220;volcano&#8221; trend with applied potentials in aqueous solutions, which is yet absent in absolute alcoholic solutions. Combined with DFT calculations, we propose that the surface H2O can serve as a strong proton donor for the first protonation step in both the C1 and C2 pathways of CORR at various applied potentials in alkaline electrolytes, leaving adsorbed *OH on the surface. This work provides fresh insights into the initial protonation steps and identity of key interfacial intermediates formed during CORR on Cu surfaces.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonlinear Optical Crystal with a Building Block Containing Expanded &#960;&#8208;Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugation delocalization from traditional functional building block (B3O6)3&#8722; to the long overlooked (HxC6N7O3)(3&#8722;x)&#8722; (x=0, 1, 2) induces significantly enhanced second&#8208;order nonlinear optical response of Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8&#8201;H2O.







Abstract
Common nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals consist of traditional functional building blocks with inherent optical limitation. Herein, inspired by traditional (B3O6)3&#8722; inorganic building block, we theoretically identified a new type of organic functional building blocks and then successfully synthesized the first cyamelurate NLO crystal, Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8&#8201;H2O. To our surprise, the constituent (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; building block is not in structurally optimal arrangement, but Ba(H2C6N7O3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8&#8201;H2O exhibits excellent optical properties including wide band gap of 4.10&#8197;eV, very large birefringence of 0.24@550&#8197;nm, and exceptionally strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response of about 12&#215;KH2PO4. Both the SHG response and birefringence are much larger than those of commercial NLO crystal &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 with optimally aligned (B3O6)3&#8722; building block. Theoretical calculations suggest that the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugation delocalization within (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; vs (B3O6)3&#8722; should be responsible to the enhanced performance. This work implies that there is still much room to develop new NLO crystals with excellent functional building blocks that may be longly neglected.

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Conventional Polyureas into Dynamic Covalent Poly(aminoketoenamide)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an approach for the chemical upcycling of urea bonds&#8208;containing materials. Our strategy is mediated by acetylacetone and ultimately affords dynamic covalent aminoketoenamide bonds. The here reported conversion scheme allows for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(aminoketoenamide) networks, which can be healed and reprocessed via catalyst&#8208;free thermal treatments.







Abstract
The chemical upcycling of polymers is an emerging strategy to transform post&#8208;consumer waste into higher&#8208;value chemicals and materials. However, on account of the high stability of the chemical bonds that constitute their main chains, the chemical modification of many polymers proves to be difficult. Here, we report a versatile approach for the upcycling of linear and cross&#8208;linked polyureas, which are widely used because of their high chemical stability. The treatment of these polymers or their composites with acetylacetone affords di&#8208;vinylogous amide&#8208;terminated compounds in good yield. These products can be reacted with aromatic isocyanates, and the resulting aminoketoenamide bonds are highly dynamic at elevated temperatures. We show here that this conversion scheme can be exploited for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(aminoketoenamide) networks, which are healable and reprocessable through thermal treatment without any catalyst.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Powered Asymmetric Hydrogel Nanomotors for Enhanced Immunochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using copper sulfides (Cu2&#8722;xS) with a strong absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region and a microfluidic chip in flow&#8208;focusing configuration with magnet&#8208;assisted photopolymerization, a 1064&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor with encapsulated DOX (AHNM&#8208;DOX) was developed. It demonstrated high motion efficiency and facilitated deep tissue penetration for enhanced in vivo immunochemotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomotors are appealing drug carriers, and the strength of the propelling force is important for their motion capability. Though high motion efficiency has been achieved with 808&#8197;nm light driven Janus&#8208;structured noble metal nanomotors, the NIR&#8208;I light penetration depth and material biocompatibility limit their broad application. Herein, we develop a 1064&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor (AHNM) with high motion capability and load it with doxorubicin for enhanced immunochemotherapy. Magnetic field assisted photopolymerization generates an asymmetric distribution of Fe3O4@Cu9S8 nanoparticles in the AHNM, producing self&#8208;thermophoresis as driving force under NIR&#8208;II irradiation. The AHNM is also functionalized with dopamine for the capture and retention of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to boost immune activation. The as&#8208;obtained NIR&#8208;II light driven AHNM has a high tumor tissue penetration capability and enhances immunochemotherapy, providing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

         <title>Stereoselective Construction of Tertiary Homoallyl Alcohols and Ethers by Nucleophilic Substitution at Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles is reported. A variety of highly sterically hindered tertiary alkyl ethers and alcohols with adjacent tertiary carbon stereocenters are obtained in good yields with excellent diastereopurity.







Abstract
An efficient method for the stereoselective construction of tertiary C&#8722;O bonds via a stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles has been developed. This substitution reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates several functional groups, providing a new access to the stereoselective formation of highly congested tertiary homoallyl alcohols and ethers.

         <title>Predicting Collagen Triple Helix Stability through Additive Effects of Terminal Residues and Caps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen model peptides are like a construction set. The stability of collagen triple helices is critically determined by the frame, terminal residues, capping groups, and their charge state. The effects are additive and can be used to predict the melting temperatures of new collagen trimers. Combined experimental and theoretical studies shed light on the origins of these effects at the molecular level.







Abstract
Collagen model peptides (CMPs) consisting of proline&#8208;(2S,4R)&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;glycine (POG) repeats have provided a breadth of knowledge of the triple helical structure of collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals. Predictive tools for triple helix stability have, however, lagged behind since the effect of CMPs with different frames ([POG]n, [OGP]n, or [GPO]n) and capped or uncapped termini have so far been underestimated. Here, we elucidated the impact of the frame, terminal functional group and its charge on the stability of collagen triple helices. Combined experimental and theoretical studies with frame&#8208;shifted, capped and uncapped CMPs revealed that electrostatic interactions, strand preorganization, interstrand H&#8208;bonding, and steric repulsion at the termini contribute to triple helix stability. We show that these individual contributions are additive and allow for the prediction of the melting temperatures of CMP trimers.

Abstract
Disclosed herein is a RhCl3&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;substituted naphthalenes, which provides a highly efficient and streamlined approach to chalcogen&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes from readily available starting materials. Introducing O, S, and Se into the anthanthrene skeleton leads to gradually increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distances but significantly enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlaps with the growth of the hetero&#8208;atom radius. Moderate &#960;&#8211;&#960; distance, overlap area, and intermolecular S&#8722;S interactions endow S&#8208;embedded anthanthrene (PTT) with excellent 2D charge&#8208;transport properties. Moreover, the transformation of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type S&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes is realized for the first time via the S&#8208;atom oxidation from PTT to PTT&#8208;O4. In organic field&#8208;effect transistor devices, PTT derivatives exhibit hole transport with mobilities up to 1.1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, while PTT&#8208;O4 shows electron transport with a mobility of 0.022&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregates Formed by NaCl Treatment of Aza&#8208;Coating Heptamethine Cyanines and Their Application to Monitoring Salt Stress of Plants and Promoting Photothermal Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>

Two J&#8208;aggregates formed by NaCl treatment of aza&#8208;coating hepetamine cyanines act as functional fluorescent probes for monitoring salt stress of plants and promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.







Abstract
The cationic nature of heptamethine cyanines gives them the capacity to form aggregates with salts by electrostatic interactions. In this work, NaCl promoted J&#8208;aggregate formation of aza&#8208;coating heptamethine cyanines is explored. NaCl can induce the N&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl Cy&#8208;CO2Bz to assemble into a J&#8208;aggregate having an absorption at 890&#8197;nm. Its excellent fluorescence response to NaCl implies that it has great potential for use as a probe for tracing salt stress in plants.

&lt;p&gt;Two J-aggregates formed by NaCl treatment of aza-coating hepetamine cyanines act as functional fluorescent probes for monitoring salt stress of plants and promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cationic nature of heptamethine cyanines gives them the capacity to form aggregates with salts by electrostatic interactions. In this work, NaCl promoted J-aggregate formation of aza-coating heptamethine cyanines is explored. NaCl can induce the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzyloxycarbonyl &lt;b&gt;Cy-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bz&lt;/b&gt; to assemble into a J-aggregate having an absorption at 890&#8197;nm. Its excellent fluorescence response to NaCl implies that it has great potential for use as a probe for tracing salt stress in plants. Moreover, NaCl also promotes formation of J-aggregates from the N-ethyloxycarbonyl &lt;b&gt;Cy-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et&lt;/b&gt;. The aggregate shows an intense absorption at 910&#8197;nm compared to the monomer which absorbs at 766&#8197;nm. Its J-aggregated form can serve as a photothermal agent. And the photothermal conversion efficiency is increased from 29.37&#8201;% to 57.59&#8201;%. This effort leads to the development of two applications of new cyanine J-aggregates including one for tracing salt stress of plants and the other for promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Decarbonylation of Oxetanone and Azetidinone: Spectroscopy, Computational Models, and Synthetic Applications

Upon irradiation with UV light, strained heterocyclic ketones expel carbon monoxide through a Norrish type I mechanism. Ylides formed in this way cyclize with a variety of double bonds.







Abstract
Photoexcitation of cyclic ketones leads to the expulsion of carbon monoxide and a mixture of products derived from diradical intermediates. Here we show that synthetic utility of this process is improved if strained heterocyclic ketones are used. Photochemistry of 3&#8208;oxetanone and N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;azetidinone has not been previously described. Decarbonylation of these 4&#8208;membered rings proceeds through a step&#8208;wise Norrish type&#8197;I cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond from the singlet excited state. Ylides derived from both compounds are high&#8208;energy species that are kinetically stable long enough to undergo [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of alkenes and produce substituted tetrahydrofurans and pyrrolidines. The reaction has a sufficiently wide scope to produce scaffolds that were either previously inaccessible or difficult to synthesize, thereby providing experimental access to new chemical space.

         <title>Nitrite Electroreduction to Ammonia Promoted by Molecular Carbon Dioxide with Near&#8208;unity Faradaic Efficiency</title>

Electrochemical reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) offers an energy&#8208;efficient route for ammonia (NH3) synthesis and reduction of nitrite pollution. However, the near 100&#8201;% reaction selectivity has yet to be achieved due to the complicated reduction route. Here, we report that carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the nitrite electroreduction to ammonia with near 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency on copper nanowire (Cu NW) catalysts in a broad potential range.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) offers an energy&#8208;efficient route for ammonia (NH3) synthesis and reduction of the level of nitrite, which is one of the major pollutants in water. However, the near 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) has yet to be achieved due to the complicated reduction route with several intermediates. Here, we report that carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the nitrite electroreduction to ammonia on copper nanowire (Cu NW) catalysts. In a broad potential range (&#8722;0.7&#8764;&#8722;1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE), the FE of nitrite to ammonia is close to 100&#8201;% with a 3.5&#8208;fold increase in activity compared to that obtained without CO2. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that CO2 acts as a catalyst to facilitate the *NO to *N step, which is the rate determining step for ammonia synthesis. The promotion effect of CO2 can be expanded to electroreduction of other nitro&#8208;compounds, such as nitrate to ammonia and nitrobenzene to aniline.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode with 96&#8201;% Utilization Rate Enabled by Solvation Structure Design</title>

The introduction of sulfolane forms a new solvation structure of Zn2+ ions in aqueous electrolytes, which significantly inhibits the side reactions of the Zn anode and realizes a stable Zn anode with high areal capacity and high utilization rate.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZBs) show promises for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is generally low due to side reactions in the aqueous electrolyte caused by the active water molecules. Here, we design a novel solvation structure in the electrolyte by introduction of sulfolane (SL). Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and experimental tests show that SL remodels the primary solvation shell of Zn2+, which significantly reduces the side reactions of Zn anode and achieves high ZUR under large capacities. Specifically, the symmetric and asymmetric cells could achieve a maximum of &#8764;96&#8201;% ZUR at an areal capacity of 24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In a ZUR of &#8764;67&#8201;%, the developed Zn&#8722;V2O5 full cell can be stably cycled for 500&#8197;cycles with an energy density of 180&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and Zn&#8208;AC capacitor is stable for 5000&#8197;cycles. This electrolyte structural engineering strategy provides new insight into achieving high ZUR of Zn anodes for high performance AZBs.

Abstract
An amphiphilic block copolymer of polyphosphinoborane has been prepared by a mechanism&#8208;led strategy of the sequential catalytic dehydropolymerization of precursor monomers, H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2 (R=Ph, n&#8208;hexyl), using the simple pre&#8208;catalyst [Rh(Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2)2]Cl. Speciation, mechanism and polymer chain growth studies support a step&#8208;growth process where reversible chain transfer occurs, i.e. H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2/oligomer/polymer can all coordinate with, and be activated by, the catalyst. Block copolymer [H2BPPhH]110&#8208;b&#8208;[H2BP(n&#8208;hexyl)H]11 can be synthesized and self&#8208;assembles in solution to form either rod&#8208;like micelles or vesicles depending on solvent polarity.

         <title>Balancing Activity and Stability in Spinel Cobalt Oxides through Geometrical Sites Occupation towards Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through tuning geometrical sites occupation, (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs with Mnoct, Nioct, Nitet shows excellent OER activity. The Ni/Mn substitution modulates the normal surface states of CoCo2O4 from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficient and thus leading to the decoupled proton&#8208;electron transfer to reconstruct a more stable surface. The optimal balance between the electroactivity and stability ensures a remarkable OER performance.







Abstract
Designing active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are vitally important to various energy conversion devices. Herein, we introduce elements Ni and Mn into (Co)tet(Co2)octO4 nanosheets (NSs) at fixed geometrical sites, including Mnoct, Nioct, and Nitet, to optimize the initial geometrical structure and modulate the CoCo2O4 surface from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficiency. The pristine (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs shows excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 281.6&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, without damaging their initial activity, the activated (Act)&#8208;(Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs after surface reconstruction exhibit long&#8208;term stability of 100&#8197;h under 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, or even 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The optimal balance between electroactivity and stability leads to remarkable OER performances, providing a pivotal guideline for designing ideal electrocatalysts and inspiring more works to focus on the dynamic change of each occupation site component.

         <title>Reduction of Na+ within a {Mg2Na2} Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg2Na2} assembly with basic molecules that are less prone to reduction than the sodium cation itself induces the complete extrusion of the elemental alkali metal.







Abstract
Ionic compounds containing sodium cations are notable for their stability and resistance to redox reactivity unless highly reducing electrical potentials are applied. Here we report that treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg2Na2} species with non&#8208;reducible organic bases induces the spontaneous and completely selective extrusion of sodium metal and oxidation of the MgI centers to the more conventional MgII state. Although these processes are also characterized by a structural reorganisation of the initially chelated diamide spectator ligand, computational quantum chemical studies indicate that intramolecular electron transfer is abetted by the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) of the {Mg2Na2} ensemble, which arise exclusively from the 3s valence atomic orbitals of the constituent sodium and magnesium atoms.

         <title>Highly Efficient Organosulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Hosts Enabled by C@Fe3N Sponge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C@Fe3N with both lithiophilic property and catalytic feature can simultaneously address the growth of dendritic Li in the anode and intermediates shuttling from the cathode. These synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;organosulfur full cell with practically necessary parameters.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;organosulfur (Li&#8208;OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li&#8208;OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well&#8208;designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe3N nanoparticles (C@Fe3N) is introduced into the Li&#8208;OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe3N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;OS full cell under realistic conditions.

         <title>Assessing the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Mice Using a Fluorescence Nanosensor for the Simultaneous Detection and Imaging of pH and Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we constructed a fluorescence nanosensor based on MOFs for the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation level in mouse models of atherosclerosis. Blood tests and two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging were used to monitor changes of blood pH and phosphate levels at different stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.







Abstract
The inflammatory microenvironment involves changes in pH and protein phosphorylation state and is closely related to the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis (AS). Herein, we constructed a dual&#8208;detection fluorescence nanosensor PCN&#8208;NP&#8208;HPZ based on post modification of MOFs, which realized the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation through the pH&#8208;sensitive group piperazine and the ZrIV node of the MOFs. The sensors were used to monitor changes in blood pH and phosphate levels at different time stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was also performed in the vascular endothelium. Blood tests combined with two&#8208;photon fluorescence images indicated that in the early stage of AS, blood and tissue pH levels were lower than that of the normal mice, while phosphate and tissue phosphorylation levels were higher than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.

         <title>Boosting Benzene Oxidation with a Spin&#8208;State&#8208;Controlled Nuclearity Effect on Iron Sub&#8208;Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic layer deposition approach precisely tunes the nuclearity of Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts anchored on N,O&#8208;doped carbon nanorods. The electronic properties and spin configuration of the sub&#8208;nanocatalysts are nuclearity dependent and dominate H2O2 activation modes and the adsorption strength of active O species on Fe sites during C&#8722;H oxidation. The single&#8208;atom catalyst, Fe1&#8208;NOC, achieves state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for benzene oxidation.







Abstract
A fundamental understanding of the nature of nuclearity effects is important for the rational design of superior sub&#8208;nanocatalysts with low nuclearity, but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Using atomic layer deposition, we precisely synthesized Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts with tunable nuclearity (Fe1&#8211;Fe4) anchored on N,O&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (NOC). The electronic properties and spin configuration of the Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts were nuclearity dependent and dominated the H2O2 activation modes and adsorption strength of active O species on Fe sites toward C&#8722;H oxidation. The Fe1&#8208;NOC single atom catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for benzene oxidation to phenol, which is ascribed to its unique coordination environment (Fe1N2O3) and medium spin state (t2g4eg1); turnover frequencies of 407&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1869&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C were obtained, which is 3.4, 5.7, and 13.6 times higher than those of Fe dimer, trimer, and tetramer catalysts, respectively.

         <title>A Nanocomposite of Bismuth Clusters and Bi2O2CO3 Sheets for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst derived from Bi2S3 is very powerful for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, achieving a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass formate yield of 67&#8201;%. The active catalyst is composed of Bi nanoclusters on Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the interfacial Bi site plays a pivotal role.







Abstract
The renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid would contribute to establishing a carbon&#8208;neutral society. The current catalyst suffers from limited activity and stability under high selectivity and the ambiguous nature of active sites. Herein, we report a powerful Bi2S3&#8208;derived catalyst that demonstrates a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% at &#8722;0.95&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The energy conversion efficiency and single&#8208;pass yield of formate reach 80&#8201;% and 67&#8201;%, respectively, and the durability reaches 100&#8197;h at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density. Pure formic acid with a concentration of 3.5&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 has been produced continuously. Our operando spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal the dynamic evolution of the catalyst into a nanocomposite composed of Bi0 clusters and Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the pivotal role of Bi0&#8722;Bi2O2CO3 interface in CO2 activation and conversion.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Halosulfonylation of Strain&#8208;Release Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of strained hydrocarbons is described that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. Sulfonyl halides featuring aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents are generated in situ from sulfinate salts and convenient halogen atom sources. This chemistry enables the synthesis of an array of halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale. Hal=Halogen.







Abstract
Sulfonylated aromatics are commonplace motifs in drugs and agrochemicals. However, methods for the direct synthesis of sulfonylated non&#8208;classical arene bioisosteres, which could improve the physicochemical properties of drug and agrochemical candidates, are limited. Here we report a solution to this challenge: a one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of [1.1.1]propellane, [3.1.1]propellane and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. The sulfonyl halides used in this chemistry feature aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents, and are conveniently generated in situ from readily available sulfinate salts and halogen atom sources. This methodology enables the synthesis of an array of pharmaceutically and agrochemically relevant halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale.

         <title>A Shuttle&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Cu&#8722;Li Battery Based on a Sandwich&#8208;Structured Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost Cu&#8722;Li batteries leveraging Cu cathode dissolution/deposition have been hindered by electrolyte related issues, including Cu crossover, low conductivity, etc. Here the authors design a sandwich solid&#8208;state electrolyte by sandwiching a Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 pellet with two deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gels to address these issues. The as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li battery exhibits significantly improved cyclability and practical energy density.







Abstract
Cu&#8722;Li batteries leveraging the two&#8208;electron redox property of Cu can offer high energy density and low cost. However, Cu&#8722;Li batteries are plagued by limited solubility and a shuttle effect of Cu ions in traditional electrolytes, which leads to low energy density and poor cycling stability. In this work, we rationally design a solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte for solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li batteries, in which a deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gel with high Cu&#8208;ion solubility is devised as a Cu&#8208;ion reservoir while a ceramic Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 interlayer is used to block Cu&#8208;ion crossover. Because of the high ionic conductivity (0.55&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), and high Cu ion solubility of solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte, a solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li battery demonstrates a high energy density of 1&#8201;485&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgCu&#8722;1and long&#8208;term cyclability with 97&#8201;% capacity retention over 120 cycles. The present study lays the groundwork for future research into low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li batteries.

         <dc:description>
Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (AFGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the C(sp3)&#8722;F bond at C2 to enable &#945;&#8208;stereocontrolled glycosylation that eliminates the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. Reactions display extremely high levels of efficiency and selectivity, and the method has been demonstrated in the synthesis of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannoses.







Abstract
Automated glycan assembly (AGA) on solid support has become invaluable in reconciling the biological importance of complex carbohydrates with the persistent challenges associated with reproducible synthesis. Whilst AGA platforms have transformed the construction of many natural sugars, validation in the construction of well&#8208;defined (site&#8208;selectively modified) glycomimetics is in its infancy. Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, the biomedical prominence of 2&#8208;fluoro sugars and the remarkable selectivities observed in fluorine&#8208;directed glycosylation, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (FDAGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the fluorine atom for stereocontrolled glycosylation on solid support, thereby eliminating the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. The logical design of C2&#8208;fluorinated mannose building blocks, and their application in the fully (&#945;&#8208;)stereocontrolled automated assembly of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannosides, is disclosed. This operationally simple strategy can be integrated into existing AGA and post&#8208;AGA protocols to augment the scope of programmed carbohydrate synthesis.

         <title>Oligothiophene&#8208;Ring&#8208;Strapped Perylene Bisimides: Functionalizable Coaxial Donor&#8211;Acceptor Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new macrocycle consisting of oligothiophene&#8208;ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide was synthesized, and the perpendicular donor&#8211;acceptor orientation was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal analysis. This functionalizable macrocycle enabled the synthesis of the corresponding linear dimer and 2D polymer. The precise positioning and preferred orientation of donor and acceptor units in this macrocycle led to ultrafast electron transfer and long&#8208;lived charge separation.







Abstract
Aesthetic designs from nature enable new knowledge to be gained and, at the same time, inspire scientific models. In this context, multicomponent macrocycles embody the advantage of precisely positioning the structural units to achieve efficient communication between them. However, the construction of a functionalizable macrocycle for ultrafast charge separation and stabilization has not been attempted. Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and transient absorption of a new functionalizable macrocycle consisting of an oligothiophene&#8208;ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide. Transient absorption results point to a sequential improvement in charge separation and stabilization from the macrocycle to the corresponding linear dimer and 2D polymer due to the unique design. Our macrocycle design with a supportive spatial arrangement of the donor and acceptor units will inspire the development of more complex synthetic systems with exciting electron&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;separation features.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Enhanced Potentiometric Aptasensing with Magneto&#8208;Controlled Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer&#8208;assembled magnetic beads can be directly measured by using a magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric ion sensor. The potentiometric aptasensing system enables rapid, efficient discrimination and quantification of multiple analytes with the assistance of deep learning models.







Abstract
Bioelectronic sensors that report charge changes of a biomolecule upon target binding enable direct and sensitive analyte detection but remain a major challenge for potentiometric measurement, mainly due to Debye Length limitations and the need for molecular&#8208;level platforms. Here, we report on a magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric method to directly and sensitively measure the target&#8208;binding induced charge change of DNA aptamers assembled on magnetic beads using a polymeric membrane potentiometric ion sensor. The potentiometric responses of the negatively charged aptamer, serving as a receptor and reporter, were dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field. Based on a potentiometric array, this non&#8208;equilibrium measurement technique combined with deep learning algorithms allows for rapidly and reliably classifying and quantifying diverse small molecules using antibiotics as models. This potentiometric strategy opens new modalities for sensing applications.

         <title>Di&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenidecaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) and Its Bis&#8208;Organopalladium Complexes: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins containing 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene as key structural elements have been prepared. The resulting macrocycle showed unexpected coordination modes toward PdII. The two bis&#8208;Pd complexes characterized in this study exhibited noteworthy chiroptical properties, including dissymmetry factors (gabs) as high as 0.038 at 763&#8197;nm, and low energy absorption bands extending into the NIR&#8208;II region.







Abstract
A non&#8208;aromatic expanded carbaporphyrinoid, incorporating two built&#8208;in 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene moieties was synthesized. The intrinsically labile structure was demonstrated by proton&#8208;triggered conformational changes between the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and quasi&#8208;M&#246;bius conformers. Upon treatment with Pd(OAc)2, the reaction produces two bis&#8208;PdII complexes with distinct coordination modes. Metal coordination serves to fix the macrocyclic frameworks with the net result that both bis&#8208;PdII complexes could be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a chiral stationary phase. The isolated enantiomers showed persistent chiroptical properties as evidenced by the intense response in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and the record high absorption dissymmetry factors (gabs of up to 0.038) seen in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. Moreover, the mutual interconversion of these two PdII complexes was found to be stereospecific and to favor the more stable isomers under weakly acidic conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptidyl Aggregates for the Fluorogenic Recognition of Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled peptidyl fluorogenic probe (CV2) able to selectively light&#8208;up parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA over other topologies is presented. CV2 allows for the staining of G4s in mitochondria over the nucleus in living cells, and is further employed for tracking the folding and unfolding of G4s in living cells, and for monitoring mitochondrial DNA damage.







Abstract
The selective monitoring of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures in living cells is important to elucidate their functions and reveal their value as diagnostic or therapeutic targets. Here we report a fluorogenic probe (CV2) able to selectively light&#8208;up parallel G4 DNA over antiparallel topologies. CV2 was constructed by conjugating the excimer&#8208;forming CV dye with a peptide sequence (l&#8208;Arg&#8208;l&#8208;Gly&#8208;glutaric acid) that specifically recognizes G4s. CV2 forms self&#8208;assembled, red excimer&#8208;emitting nanoaggregates in aqueous media, but specific binding to G4s triggers its disassembly into rigidified monomeric dyes, leading to a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, selective permeation of CV2 stains G4s in mitochondria over the nucleus. CV2 was employed for tracking the folding and unfolding of G4s in living cells, and for monitoring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. These properties make CV2 appealing to investigate the possible roles of mtDNA G4s in diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction.

         <title>Medium/High&#8208;Entropy Amalgamated Core/Shell Nanoplate Achieves Efficient Formic Acid Catalysis for Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HP) with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell has been successfully achieved. The HEA HP not only displays the record formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) performance, but also readily achieves much higher peak power density (321.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) along with the long&#8208;term lifetime under the operating fuel cell conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have been attracting extensive research interests in designing advanced nanomaterials, while their precise control is still in the infancy stage. Herein, we have reported a well&#8208;defined PtBiPbNiCo hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HPs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Structure analysis decodes that the HEA HP is constructed with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell. Significantly, the HEA HPs can reach the specific and mass activities of 27.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 7.1&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), being the record catalyst ever achieved in Pt&#8208;based catalysts, and can realize the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power density (321.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in fuel cell. Further experimental and theoretical analyses collectively evidence that the hexagonal intermetallic core/atomic layer shell structure and multi&#8208;element synergy greatly promote the direct dehydrogenation pathway of formic acid molecule and suppress the formation of CO*.

         <title>Photocatalytic Deuterium Atom Transfer Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes with High Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetically benign deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has been achieved. This DAT protocol realized higher functional group (FG) tolerance and chemoselectivity than the existing method, and allowed access to complex deuterated compounds including a heavy drug and deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids.







Abstract
Due to its mild reaction conditions and unique chemoselectivity, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) hydrogenation represents an indispensable method for the synthesis of complex molecules. Its analog using deuterium, deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration, is expected to enable access to complex deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds. However, DAT deuteration has been scarcely studied for synthetic purposes, and a method that possesses the favorable characteristics of HAT hydrogenations has remained elusive. Herein, we report a protocol for the photocatalytic DAT deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. In contrast to the previous DAT deuteration, this method tolerates a variety of synthetically useful functional groups including haloarenes. The late&#8208;stage deuteration also allows access to deuterated amino acids as well as donepezil&#8208;d2. Thus, this work demonstrates the potential of DAT chemistry to become the alternative method of choice for preparing deuterium&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Aminoalkylative Amination of Unactivated Aminoenynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective aminoalkylative amination of unactivated aminoenynes by using aminals or aldehydes and amines as coupling partners has been developed, which permits facile synthesis of various chiral exocyclic allenic amines bearing 5 to 12&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. Synthetic transformations of the chiral products were also conducted to afford structurally unique chiral spirodiamines via axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for preventing the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of alkylpalladium species by ligation of the palladium with adjacent amino&#8208;group was developed, which enabled a novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing aminoalkylative amination of unactivated aminoenynes. The reaction is amenable to aminals, as well as aliphatic aldehydes with secondary amines, which provides straightforward access to structurally diverse exocyclic allenic amines bearing 5 to 12&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. With chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated palladium complex as the catalyst, an enantioselective variant was achieved with up to 93&#8201;% ee. Simultaneously, synthetic transformations of the chiral products were also conducted to afford structurally unique spirodiamines including one pharmaceutically active molecule via axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Electrochemical C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Arenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective approach for the electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes with CO2 has been developed to obtain the valuable aromatic carboxylic acids with excellent atom economy. High levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity were achieved by this electrochemical reductive activation strategy.







Abstract
Herein, a direct, metal&#8208;free, and site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes by reductive activation using CO2 as the economic and abundant carboxylic source was reported. The electrocarboxylation was carried out in an operationally simple manner with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, setting the stage for the challenging site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of unactivated (hetero)arenes. The robust nature of the electrochemical strategy was reflected by a broad scope of substrates with excellent atom economy and unique selectivity. Notably, the direct and selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of various challenging arenes worked well in this approach, including electron&#8208;deficient naphthalenes, pyridines, simple phenyl derivatives, and substituted quinolines. The method benefits from being externally catalyst&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free, which makes it extremely attractive for potential applications.

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations and Implications for Catalysis of Quasi&#8208;d10 Configurations in Formal Gold(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the interplay of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computational analysis, we show that gold +I and +III complexes, despite their physically distinct electronic structures, tend to activate substrates to similar extents. We focus in particular on the role of electron&#8208;sharing covalency of the metal&#8208;ligand bonds and provide an explanation for the often&#8208;similar reactivities observed for gold complexes in these physical oxidation states.







Abstract
Several gold +I and +III complexes are investigated computationally and spectroscopically, focusing on the d&#8208;configuration and physical oxidation state of the metal center. Density functional theory calculations reveal the non&#8208;negligible electron&#8208;sharing covalent character of the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#963;&#8208;bonding framework. The bonding of gold(III) is shown to be isoelectronic to the formal CuIII complex [Cu(CF3)4]1&#8722;, in which the metal center tries to populate its formally unoccupied 3dx2&#8208;y2 orbital via &#963;&#8208;bonding, leading to a reduced d10 CuI description. However, Au L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals excitation into the d&#8208;orbital of the AuIII species is still possible, showing that a genuine d10 configuration is not achieved. We also find an increased electron&#8208;sharing nature of the &#963;&#8208;bonds in the AuI species, relative to their AgI and CuI analogues, due to the low&#8208;lying 6s orbital. We propose that gold +I and +III complexes form similar bonds with substrates, owing primarily to participation of the 5dx2&#8208;y2 or 6s orbital, respectively, in bonding, indicating why AuI and AuIII complexes often have similar reactivity.

The bonding of gold(III) is shown to be isoelectronic to the formal Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex [Cu(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, in which the metal center tries to populate its formally unoccupied 3d&lt;sub&gt;x2-y2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital via &#963;-bonding, leading to a reduced d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; description. However, Au L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals excitation into the d-orbital of the Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; species is still possible, showing that a genuine d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; configuration is not achieved. We also find an increased electron-sharing nature of the &#963;-bonds in the Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species, relative to their Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; analogues, due to the low-lying 6s orbital. We propose that gold +I and +III complexes form similar bonds with substrates, owing primarily to participation of the 5d&lt;sub&gt;x2-y2&lt;/sub&gt; or 6s orbital, respectively, in bonding, indicating why Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes often have similar reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Mass Transport in Electrocatalysis Down to Sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm through Nanoscale Grade Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy to achieve confined mass transport at the few&#8208;nanometer scale through utilization of ordered 3d interconnected sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium, the 3d arrangement of pores was superior to the 2d system in maximizing catalyst performance.







Abstract
Nano and single&#8208;atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis. However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic&#8208;scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites. Herein, a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass&#8208;transport problem by utilizing ordered three&#8208;dimensional (3d) interconnected sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores with grade separation allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium (Ru), the 3d mesopores are on a superior level to two&#8208;dimensional system at maximizing the catalyst performance and the obtained Ru catalyst outperforms most of the other HER catalysts. This work provides a potential route to fine&#8208;tuning few&#8208;nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis.

         <title>Non&#8208;trivial Contribution of Carbon Hybridization in Carbon&#8208;based Substrates to Electrocatalytic Activities in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we investigated the correlation between carbon hybridization and sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). We reveal that the nitrogen atom doped in graphitic carbon possesses a higher local charge density and a lower Gibbs free energy towards the formation of polysulfides than in amorphous carbon. The carbon is not only limited as conductive support but also plays a non&#8208;trivial contribution to the electrocatalytic activities of SRR.







Abstract
Appling an electrochemical catalyst is an efficient strategy for inhibiting the shuttle effect and enhancing the S utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. Carbon&#8208;based materials are the most common conductive agents and catalyst supports used in Li&#8208;S batteries, but the correlation between the diversity of hybridizations and sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) catalytic activity remains unclear. Here, by establishing two forms of carbon models, i.e., graphitic carbon (GC) and amorphous carbon (AC), we observe that the nitrogen atom doped in the GC possesses a higher local charge density and a lower Gibbs free energy towards the formation of polysulfides than in the AC. And the GC&#8208;based electrode consistently inherits considerably enhanced SRR kinetics and superior cycling stability and rate capability in Li&#8208;S batteries. Therefore, the function of carbon in Li&#8208;S batteries is not only limited as conductive support but also plays an unignorable contribution to the electrocatalytic activities of SRR.

Guanidinium tetrafluoroborate (1) is a crystal that shows malleability and multiaxial ferroelectricity. Powder samples of 1 can be transformed by press forming or melt growing into transparent bulk crystalline plates that exhibit high ferroelectric performance, including the largest spontaneous polarization hitherto reported for bulk polycrystals of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics.







Abstract
Among ferroelectric crystals based on small molecules, plastic/ferroelectric crystals are currently receiving particular attention because they can be used as bulk polycrystals. Herein, we show that an ionic molecular ferroelectric crystal, guanidinium tetrafluoroborate, exhibits significant malleability and multiaxial ferroelectricity despite the absence of a plastic crystal phase. Powder samples of this crystal can be processed into transparent bulk crystalline plates either by press&#8208;forming or by melt&#8208;growing. The plates show high ferroelectric performance and related properties, demonstrating the largest hitherto reported spontaneous polarization for bulk polycrystals of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Owing to the ready availability of large&#8208;scale materials and processability into various bulk crystalline forms, this ferroelectric crystal represents a highly promising functional material that will boost research on diverse applications as bulk crystals.

         <title>Liquid Fluxional Ga Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we discover the fluxional property of single atom catalysts (SACs) could effectively influence the catalytic performance. Ga SACs was firstly systematically synthesized to be used in efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction for CO. The Ga SACs with the P, S atomic coordination environment displays specific fluxional properties, showing CO products with FE of &#8776;92&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Precise design and tuning of the micro&#8208;atomic structure of single atom catalysts (SACs) can help efficiently adapt complex catalytic systems. Herein, we inventively found that when the active center of the main group element gallium (Ga) is downsized to the atomic level, whose characteristic has significant differences from conventional bulk and rigid Ga catalysts. The Ga SACs with a P, S atomic coordination environment display specific flow properties, showing CO products with FE of &#8776;92&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the adaptive dynamic transition of Ga optimizes the adsorption energy of the *COOH intermediate and renews the active sites in time, leading to excellent CO2RR selectivity and stability. This liquid single atom catalysts system with dynamic interfaces lays the foundation for future exploration of synthesis and catalysis.

The challenging gold&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization of tertiary amine was achieved via the intermediacy of a reactive &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene. The use of a malonate group exerting electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects was key to the success of the transformation. The tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products could be subsequently oxidized to access structural motifs found in bioactive natural products.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization is a useful strategy for the straightforward formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Heteroatom bonds. In the present work, a unique approach for the challenging electrophilic Au&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization of tertiary amines is presented. Electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects exerted by the use of a malonate unit in the substrate were key to the success of this transformation. This new reactivity was applied to the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products which, under oxidative conditions, could be converted into valuable structural motifs found in bioactive alkaloid natural products.

Fullerenes. In their Research Article (e202211704), Jianyuan Zhang et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of metallobuckytrio (MBT), a three&#8208;buckyball system, as a modular platform for a family of structurally defined metallofullerene derivatives that can safely carry rare&#8208;earth elements.

A site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes with CO2 is reported by Youai Qiu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214710). A direct metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, and site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes by reductive activation using CO2 as an economic and abundant carboxyl source was developed. The robust nature of this strategy is reflected in a broad scope of substrates, excellent atom economy, and unique selectivity.

Synergy between salt and sugar Nanometric ions like Keggin polyoxometalates are revealed to induce the cross&#8208;linking and hydrogel formation of polymeric sugars, namely non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers, as reported by Max Hohenschutz, Walter Richtering, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202210208). This novel gelation phenomenon exceeds the thickening effects of typical additives like classical salts and surfactants by orders of magnitude and is due to the superchaotropicity of the nano&#8208;ions, which drives them out of the water bulk onto the polymers.

         <title>Cover Picture: Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 3/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical approaches enable the efficient synthesis of a variety of chemicals. Hirokazu Kobayashi, Atsushi Fukuoka et&#8197;al. report in their Research Article (e202214229) that an activated carbon catalyst with weak acid sites converts chitin, an abundant but highly recalcitrant biomass, selectively into chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides under ball&#8208;milling conditions. Large chitin molecules are hydrolyzed more rapidly than small oligomers, leading to a high selectivity. The produced oligosaccharides enhance plant immune systems so that crops can withstand pathogens with low agrochemical use.

         <title>Towards a Cradle&#8208;to&#8208;Cradle Polyolefin Lifecycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective depolymerization of polyethylene to propylene was achieved by two independent studies using a tandem catalysis approach. By combining a dehydrogenation, an isomerization and an ethenolysis catalyst under an ethylene atmosphere, propylene was the favoured product which could be further used as precursor for polypropylene production.







Abstract
Achieving efficient chemical depolymerization of waste polyolefins to monomers remains an unsolved challenge, while it could be an effective means to avoid further waste accumulation in the environment and generate economic benefits. In a recent publication by Conk et&#8197;al., polyethylene (PE) is converted to propylene, the second most used monomer in the polymer industry. The conversion is achieved via a tandem catalysis approach in which partially unsaturated PE chains react with ethylene to generate propylene with yields as high as 87&#8201;%. The study is a first proof of concept showcasing a selective chemical depolymerization of PE to a monomer. Future research is expected to focus on the catalyst optimization, process design, and compatibility with contaminated and multi&#8208;polymer waste streams.

         <title>Kinetics Driven by Hollow Nanoreactors: An Opportunity for Controllable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of hollow nanoreactors offers new opportunities for developing controllable catalysis. This Review presents the basic context of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory of hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the structure&#8211;performance relation for kinetics within hollow nanoreactors. The proposed perspectives may contribute to further theoretical innovations in controllable catalysis.







Abstract
As a novel class of catalytic materials, hollow nanoreactors offer new opportunities for improving catalytic performance owing to their higher controllability on molecular kinetic behavior. Nevertheless, to achieve controllable catalysis with specific purposes, the catalytic mechanism occurring inside hollow nanoreactors remains to be further understood. In this context, this Review presents a focused discussion about the basic concept of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory for hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the intrinsic correlation between key structural parameters of hollow nanoreactors and molecular kinetic behaviors. We aim to provide in&#8208;depth insights into understanding kinetics occurred within typical hollow nanoreactors. The perspectives proposed in this paper may contribute to the development of the fundamental theoretical framework of hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) show potential for a wide range of applications based on their unique characteristics, such as interpenetrated channels, low densities, high surface areas, and high chemical stabilities. In this Minireview, we summarize the strategies for the preparation of functional 3D COFs, including crystallization methods and functionalization pathways, and provide an overview of their potential applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with spatially periodic networks demonstrate significant advantages over their 2D counterparts, including enhanced specific surface areas, interconnected channels, and more sufficiently exposed active sites. Nevertheless, research on these materials has met an impasse due to serious problems in crystallization and stability, which must be solved for practical applications. In this Minireview, we first summarize some strategies for preparing functional 3D COFs, including crystallization techniques and functionalization methods. Hereafter, applications of these functional materials are presented, covering adsorption, separation, catalysis, fluorescence, sensing, and batteries. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for the development of 3D COFs are discussed.

         <title>Doping/Alloying Pathways to Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskites with Ultimate Photoluminescence Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites emit broadband visible photoluminescence originating from self&#8208;trapped excitonic states. Introduction of &#8220;alien&#8221; metals via doping or alloying into perovskite matrices often results in a dramatic enhancement of both light absorbance and emission. Mechanisms, challenges, and applications of these phenomena constitute the topic of the present Minireview.







Abstract
Tailored modifications of halide lead&#8208;free perovskites (LFPs) via doping/alloying with metal cations have been recognized as a promising pathway to highly efficient inorganic phosphors with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of up to 100&#8201;%. Such materials typically display selective sensitivity to UV light, a broad PL range, and long PL lifetimes as well as a unique compositional variability and stability&#8212;an ideal combination for many light&#8208;harvesting applications. This Minireview presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in doped LFPs, focusing on the reports published mostly in the last two to three years. We discuss the factors determining the efficiency and spectral parameters of the broadband PL of doped LFPs depending on the dopant and host matrix, both in micro&#8208; and nanocrystalline states, address the most relevant challenges this rapidly developing research area is facing, and outline the most promising concepts for further progress in this field.

         <dc:description>
Bioinspired total synthesis of A201A, A201D and A201E is presented, as modeled on the biosynthetic pathway reported previously. The L&#8208;galactofuranose was obtained from a cheap and readily available D&#8208;galactopyranose through a C1/C6 head&#8208;to&#8208;tail oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;switch strategy. The challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside, an essential core structure of the A201 family, was accessed through remote 2&#8208;quinolinecarbonyl&#8208;assisted glycosylation.

Herein, bioinspired total syntheses of A201A, A201D, and A201E based on a previously reported biosynthetic pathway are presented. The challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside, a core structure of the A201 family, was obtained by remote 2&#8208;quinolinecarbonyl&#8208;assisted glycosylation. We accomplished the total synthesis of A201A and A201E based on the critical 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside moiety through late&#8208;stage glycosylation without any interference from basic dimethyl adenosine. We also confirmed the absolute configuration of A201E by total synthesis. This modular synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of A201 family antibiotics, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action. This study satisfies the increasing demand for developing novel antibiotics inspired by the A201 family.

&lt;p&gt;Bioinspired total synthesis of A201A, A201D and A201E is presented, as modeled on the biosynthetic pathway reported previously. The L-galactofuranose was obtained from a cheap and readily available D-galactopyranose through a C1/C6 head-to-tail oxidation-state-switch strategy. The challenging 1,2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-furanoside, an essential core structure of the A201 family, was accessed through remote 2-quinolinecarbonyl-assisted glycosylation.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalizations: Divergent Synthesis of Indole[a]&#8208; and [b]&#8208;Fused Polycycles

The exposure of (alkylphenyl)ethynyl substituted phenyl azides to JohnPhosAu(I) catalysts leads to the divergent synthesis of indole&#8208;fused polycycles via N&#8208; or C&#8208;cyclization facilitated via benzyl to &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbene 1,5&#8208;hydride shift. The chemoselectivity depends on the counter&#8208;anion, the reactivity of the carbene, and the attached alkyl groups at the benzylic position.







Abstract
Phenyl azides substituted by an (alkylphenyl)ethynyl group facilitate benzylic sp3(C&#8722;H) functionalization in the presence of a JohnPhosAu catalyst, resulting in indole&#8208;fused tetra&#8208; and pentacycles via divergent N&#8208; or C&#8208;cyclization. The chemoselectivity is influenced depending on the counter&#8208;anion, the electron density of the &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbene, and the alkyl groups stabilizing the benzylic carbocation originating from a 1,5&#8208;hydride shift. An isotopic labeling experiment demonstrates the involvement of an indolylgold(I) species resulting from a tautomerization that is much faster than the deauration. The formation of a benzylic sp3(C&#8722;H) functionalization leading to an indole&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.

         <title>Structural Influence of Lone Pairs in GeP2N4, a Germanium(II) Nitridophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the discovery of the first germanium(II) nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, we present a way to use the stereochemical influence of lone pairs to modify crystal structures. This approach could be applied to other literature&#8208;known nitridophosphates by cation exchange, altering the crystal structures and thus further increasing their already widespread properties and field of application.







Abstract
Owing to their widespread properties, nitridophosphates are of high interest in current research. Explorative high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature investigations yielded various compounds with stoichiometry MP2N4 (M=Be, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cd), which are discussed as ultra&#8208;hard or luminescent materials, when doped with Eu2+. Herein, we report the first germanium nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, synthesized from Ge3N4 and P3N5 at 6&#8197;GPa and 800&#8201;&#176;C. The structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, IR and NMR spectroscopy. The highly condensed network of PN4&#8208;tetrahedra shows a strong structural divergence to other MP2N4 compounds, which is attributed to the stereochemical influence of the lone pair of Ge2+. Thus, the formal exchange of alkaline earth cations with Ge2+ may open access to various compounds with literature&#8208;known stoichiometry, however, new structures and properties.

         <title>(SCp)Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura Reaction for Building&#8208;up Axial Chirality: Counteranion&#8208;Directed Switching of Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction enabled by a chiral tri&#8208;substituted SCpRh(III)&#8208;catalyst is described. The desired axially chiral products can be afforded in moderate to excellent yields (up to 85&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). Meanwhile, DFT calculations provide rationales behind this unique phenomenon of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of the pathways in C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction is an important method for extending &#960;&#8208;systems by forging multi&#8208;substituted benzene rings via double aryl C&#8722;H activation and annulation with alkynes. However, the development of highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction remains rather challenging. Herein, we report an asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction between 1&#8208;aryl benzo[h]isoquinolines and internal alkynes enabled by a SCpRh&#8208;catalyst. Judiciously choosing the counteranion of the Rh&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the desired reactivity over the competitive formation of azoniahelicenes. Detailed mechanistic studies support the proposal of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of reaction pathways in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Rational Design of a Facially Coordinating P,N,N Ligand for Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn catalyst has been rationally redesigned to repel sp3hybridised substituents while attracting sp2 substituents, and hence enable enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic ketones. DFT calculations enable a robust prediction of the level of enantiocontrol across a range of substrates.







Abstract
DFT calculations on the full catalytic cycle for manganese catalysed enantioselective hydrogenation of a selection of ketones have been carried out at the PBE0&#8208;D3PCM//RI&#8208;BP86PCM level. Mn complexes of an enantiomerically pure chiral P,N,N ligand have been found to be most reactive when adopting a facial coordination mode. The use of a new ligand with an ortho&#8208;substituted dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine motif has been calculated to completely transform the levels of enantioselectivity possible for the hydrogenation of cyclic ketones relative to the first&#8208;generation Mn catalysts. In silico evaluation of substrates has been used to identify those likely to be reduced with high enantiomer ratios (er), and others that would exhibit less selectivity; good agreements were then found in experiments. Various cyclic ketones and some acetophenone derivatives were hydrogenated with er's up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Dendritic Quaternary&#8208;Encoded Oligourethanes for Data Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes bearing self&#8208;immolative linkages are developed for high&#8208;strength data encryption. Specifically, the fragmentation paths of dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes under MALDI&#8208;ToF MS/MS conditions can be translated into 2D matrices with &#8776;1.98&#215;1087 permutations, and each 2772&#8208;bit code 2D matrix can be further used as a unique decryption key to decipher the QR code for confidential communications.







Abstract
The use of sequence&#8208;defined digital polymers for data storage and encryption has received increasing attention due to their precision structures similar to natural biomacromolecules (e.g., DNA) but increased stability. However, the rapid development of sequencing techniques raises the concern of information leakage. Herein, dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes bearing a photoresponsive trigger, self&#8208;immolative backbones, and a mass spectrometry tag of PEG dendron have been developed for data encryption. Although the sequence information in linear analogs can be readily deciphered by mass spectrometry, sequencing of dendritic oligourethanes cannot be achieved by either primary MS or tandem MS/MS owing to the unique spatial conformation. Intriguingly, the fragmentation pathways of a quaternary dendrimer under MS/MS conditions can be converted to 2772&#8208;bit 2D matrices with &#8776;1.98&#215;1087 permutations, serving as high&#8208;strength encryption keys for highly reliable data encryption.

         <title>Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;ion Binding as a Gelation Motif in Cellulose Ether Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;ions, like polyoxometalates and boron clusters, co&#8208;assemble strongly with non&#8208;ionic solutes in water driven by the chaotropic effect. Here, nano&#8208;ion assembly with non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers (CE) is shown to result in unprecedented thickening effects and gelation of CE&#8208;solutions. An interplay of electrostatic repulsion and attraction between chains arises upon nano&#8208;ion adsorption to the CE&#8208;polymer and provides a facile novel way of gelling CEs.







Abstract
Nanometer&#8208;sized anions (nano&#8208;ions) like polyoxometalates and boron clusters exhibit so&#8208;called superchaotropic behavior, which describes their strong binding to hydrated non&#8208;ionic matter in water. We show here that nano&#8208;ions, at millimolar concentrations, dramatically enhance the viscosity and induce gelation of aqueous solutions of non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers (CEs), a class of widely utilized polymers known for their thickening and gel&#8208;forming ability. These phenomena arise from an interplay of attractive forces and repulsive electrostatic forces between CE&#8208;chains upon nano&#8208;ion binding. The attractive forces manifest themselves as aggregation of CE&#8208;chains into a physically crosslinked polymer network (gel). In turn, the electrostatic repulsions hamper the viscosity increase and gelation. Superchaotropic nano&#8208;ion binding emerges as a novel and general physical crosslinking motif for CE&#8208;solutions and exceeds by far the conventional thickening effects of classical salts and ionic surfactants.

         <title>Nanoporous Films with Oriented Arrays of Molecular Motors for Photoswitching the Guest Adsorption and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regular array of oriented molecular motors is presented by incorporating overcrowded alkene molecules as linker in metal&#8211;organic framework thin films. By switching between the stable and metastable states, the adsorption and diffusion properties of the guest molecules are controlled.







Abstract
Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a severe challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom&#8208;up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oriented overcrowded&#8208;alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded&#8208;alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light&#8208;induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film's transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy. As shown by gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta&#8208;)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the realization of an alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which combines N&#8208;sulfonyl hydrazones and C(sp3)&#8722;H donors through a diarylketone&#8208;enabled photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer and a subsequent fragmentation of the obtained alkylated hydrazide. This metal&#8208;free protocol provides a preparatively useful route to various medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds, such as homobenzylic ethers, aryl ethyl amines, and &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
The ability to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds from easily accessible reagents is a crucial, yet challenging endeavor for synthetic organic chemists. Herein, we report the realization of such a cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which combines N&#8208;sulfonyl hydrazones and C(sp3)&#8722;H donors through a diarylketone&#8208;enabled photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer and a subsequent fragmentation of the obtained alkylated hydrazide. This mild and metal&#8208;free protocol was employed to prepare a wide array of alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupled products and is tolerant of a variety of functional groups. The application of this chemistry further provides a preparatively useful route to various medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds, such as homobenzylic ethers, aryl ethyl amines, &#946;&#8208;amino acids and other moieties which are commonly encountered in approved pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and natural products.

         <title>Identification of Cyclohexadienyl Hydrides as Intermediates in Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insertion of arenes into metal hydride bonds has been proposed a key step in the catalytic hydrogenation of arenes. Using phosphino(imino)pyridine complexes of molybdenum, the selective insertion of benzene into Mo&#8208;hydride bonds has been observed. The isolated molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides are active precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene and release cyclohexadiene upon addition of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Treatment of phosphino(imino)pyridine (PIP) molybdenum cyclooctadiene (COD) complexes [(PIP)Mo(COD)] with dihydrogen in the presence of benzene selectively furnished the molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)], which are precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] arises from a rarely observed insertion of benzene into a molybdenum&#8208;hydride bond, a key step in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation of arenes. The reaction with toluene afforded a single isomer of the corresponding molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydride while para&#8208;xylene predominantly formed the molybdenum &#951;6&#8208;arene complex with the insertion product being a minor component. Addition of carbon monoxide to a cyclohexane&#8208;d12 solution of [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] liberated cyclohexadiene, providing experimental support for a higher kinetic barrier for the subsequent steps en route to cycloalkanes.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)], which are precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. [(PIP)MoH(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)] arises from a rarely observed insertion of benzene into a molybdenum-hydride bond, a key step in the molybdenum-catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation of arenes. The reaction with toluene afforded a single isomer of the corresponding molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydride while &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-xylene predominantly formed the molybdenum &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene complex with the insertion product being a minor component. Addition of carbon monoxide to a cyclohexane-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; solution of [(PIP)MoH(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)] liberated cyclohexadiene, providing experimental support for a higher kinetic barrier for the subsequent steps en route to cycloalkanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Earth Metal Mediated Benzene&#8208;to&#8208;Biphenyl Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attempts to isolate low&#8208;valent (BDI)Ae&#8208;Ae(BDI) complexes led to reduction of the benzene solvent and formation of (BDI)Ae&#8208;(C6H6)&#8208;Ae(BDI); BDI=&#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand, Ae=Ca or Sr. Reaction of bridging C6H62&#8722; with benzene gave (biphenyl)2&#8722; complexes. Ball&#8208;milling is an efficient synthetic tool for this dehydrogenative benzene&#8208;benzene coupling. Calculations suggest attack of C6H62&#8722; at benzene. This is facilitated by Ae2+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;benzene coordination.







Abstract
Complex [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6), with a C6H62&#8722; dianion bridging two Ca2+ ions, reacts with benzene to yield [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(biphenyl) with a bridging biphenyl2&#8722; dianion (DIPePBDI=HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2; DIPeP=2,6&#8208;CH(Et)2&#8208;phenyl). The biphenyl complex was also prepared by reacting [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6) with biphenyl or by reduction of [(DIPePBDI)CaI]2 with KC8 in presence of biphenyl. Benzene&#8208;benzene coupling was also observed when the deep purple product of ball&#8208;milling [(DIPPBDI)CaI(THF)]2 with K/KI was extracted with benzene (DIPP=2,6&#8208;CH(Me)2&#8208;phenyl) giving crystalline [(DIPPBDI)Ca(THF)]2(biphenyl) (52&#8201;% yield). Reduction of [(DIPePBDI)SrI]2 with KC8 gave highly labile [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(C6H6) as a black powder (61&#8201;% yield) which reacts rapidly and selectively with benzene to [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(biphenyl). DFT calculations show that the most likely route for biphenyl formation is a pathway in which the C6H62&#8722; dianion attacks neutral benzene. This is facilitated by metal&#8208;benzene coordination.

         <title>Bayesian Self&#8208;Optimization for Telescoped Continuous Flow Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 3, January 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autonomous continuous flow platform for the rapid development of multistep synthetic pathways is reported. New multipoint sampling and Bayesian optimization techniques were combined, enabling simultaneous identification of optimum reaction conditions within a pharmaceutical process. The short optimization times achieved are promising for development of telescoped reactions in the future.







Abstract
The optimization of multistep chemical syntheses is critical for the rapid development of new pharmaceuticals. However, concatenating individually optimized reactions can lead to inefficient multistep syntheses, owing to chemical interdependencies between the steps. Herein, we develop an automated continuous flow platform for the simultaneous optimization of telescoped reactions. Our approach is applied to a Heck cyclization&#8208;deprotection reaction sequence, used in the synthesis of a precursor for 1&#8208;methyltetrahydroisoquinoline C5 functionalization. A simple method for multipoint sampling with a single online HPLC instrument was designed, enabling accurate quantification of each reaction, and an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathways. Notably, integration of Bayesian optimization techniques identified an 81&#8201;% overall yield in just 14&#8197;h, and revealed a favorable competing pathway for formation of the desired product.
