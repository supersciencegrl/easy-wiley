         <title>Modulating the Microenvironments of Robust Metal Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four robust metal hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of functional groups have been successfully constructed, which exhibit distinctly different photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, for the first time, highlighting the microenvironment modulation in HOFs plays an important role in regulating photocatalysis.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are outstanding candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, most of reported HOFs suffer from poor stability and photocatalytic activity in the absence of Pt cocatalyst. Herein, a series of metal HOFs (Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X, X=COOMe, Br, tBu and OMe) have been rationally constructed based on dinuclear cobalt complexes, which exhibit exceptional stability in the presence of strong acid (12&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (5&#8197;M NaOH) for at least 10&#8197;days. More impressively, by varying the &#8208;X groups of the dinuclear cobalt complexes, the microenvironment of Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X can be modulated, giving rise to obviously different photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#8722;X group sequence of &#8722;COOMe&gt;&#8722;Br&gt;&#8722;tBu&gt;&#8722;OMe. The optimized Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;COOMe shows H2 generation rate up to 12.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers and cocatalysts, which is superior to most reported Pt&#8208;assisted photocatalytic systems. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8722;X groups grafted on Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X possess different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, thus regulating the electronic structures of Co catalytic centres and proton activation barrier for H2 production, and leading to the distinctly different photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5&#8208;bistrifluoromethylphenyl (ArF) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram&#8208;scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p&#8208;block cations.







Abstract
Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Imaging of Precisely&#8208;Defined Redox and Reactive Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex interfacial reactions hinder understanding critical interfacial processes in electrochemical energy and separation systems. This mini&#8208;review explores an emerging field of interfacial engineering that enables preparing precisely defined interfaces and visualizing their reactivity using single&#8208;entity electrochemistry, thereby enabling the predictive understanding of energy&#8208;relevant redox and reactive electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Understanding the diverse electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces (EEIs) is a critical challenge to developing more efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. Establishing a predictive molecular&#8208;level understanding of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) is challenging due to the presence of multiple intertwined chemical and electrochemical processes occurring at battery electrodes. Similarly, chemical conversions in reactive electrochemical systems are often influenced by the heterogeneous distribution of active sites, surface defects, and catalyst particle sizes. In this mini review, we highlight an emerging field of interfacial science that isolates the impact of specific chemical species by preparing precisely&#8208;defined EEIs and visualizing the reactivity of their individual components using single&#8208;entity characterization techniques. We highlight the broad applicability and versatility of these methods, along with current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art instrumentation and future opportunities for these approaches to address key scientific challenges related to batteries, chemical separations, and fuel cells. We establish that controlled preparation of well&#8208;defined electrodes combined with single entity characterization will be crucial to filling key knowledge gaps and advancing the theories used to describe and predict chemical and physical processes occurring at EEIs and accelerating new materials discovery for energy applications.

         <title>Solution State&#8208;Like Reactivity of a Flexible Crystalline Werner&#8208;Type Metal Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible crystalline Werner&#8208;type Cd(II) complex containing photoreactive ligands displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition type reactivity in the solid state, and associated unique properties including a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced development of porosity.







Abstract
Flexible crystalline solids exhibit unique properties in response to external stimuli like heat and light. However, challenges exist in developing crystalline solids that have similar degrees of flexibility as in solution. Herein, we report the preparation of the new flexible crystalline metal complex [Cd(CF3SO3)2(4&#8208;spy)4] (4&#8208;spy=4&#8208;styrylpyridine), which contains photoreactive 4&#8208;spy ligand. Unlike traditional solids, this metal complex displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition reactivity. Specifically, UV irradiation of the crystalline material leads to formation of the same diverse array of dimers and cis isomer that are generated by photoreaction in the solution state. In addition, the photoresponsive flexibility of the solid leads to a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced formation of pores. The origin of the solution state&#8208;like photoreactivity of the solid is related to properties of the Cd(II) cation and fluorinated CF3SO3 anion, and the multi&#8208;orientational arrangement of the 4&#8208;spy ligands.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Gradient Solution Deposition Amends Unfavorable Band Structure of Sb2(S,Se)3 Film for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal deposition applying gradient&#8208;temperature is able to manipulate anion distribution in Sb2(S,Se)3 film, reversing the unfavorable band structure and facilitating carrier transport. Combining with the improved morphology and defect properties, Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 10.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
Band structure of a semiconducting film critically determines the charge separation and transport efficiency. In antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells, the hydrothermal method has achieved control of band gap width of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film through tuning the atomic ratio of S/Se, resulting in an efficiency breakthrough towards 10&#8201;%. However, the obtained band structure exhibits an unfavorable gradient distribution in terms of carrier transport, which seriously impedes the device efficiency improvement. To solve this problem, here we develop a strategy by intentionally regulating hydrothermal temperature to control the chemical reaction kinetics between S and Se sources with Sb source. This approach enables the control over vertical distribution of S/Se atomic ratio in Sb2(S,Se)3 films, forming a favorable band structure which is conducive to carrier transport. Meanwhile, the adjusted element distribution not only ensures the uniformity of grain structure, but also increases the Se content of the films and suppress sulfur vacancy defects. Ultimately, the device delivers a high efficiency of 10.55&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. This study provides an effective strategy towards manipulating the element distribution in mixed&#8208;anion compound films prepared by solution&#8208;based method to optimize their optical and electrical properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Band structure of a semiconducting film critically determines the charge separation and transport efficiency. In antimony selenosulfide (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solar cells, the hydrothermal method has achieved control of band gap width of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin film through tuning the atomic ratio of S/Se, resulting in an efficiency breakthrough towards 10&#8201;%. However, the obtained band structure exhibits an unfavorable gradient distribution in terms of carrier transport, which seriously impedes the device efficiency improvement. To solve this problem, here we develop a strategy by intentionally regulating hydrothermal temperature to control the chemical reaction kinetics between S and Se sources with Sb source. This approach enables the control over vertical distribution of S/Se atomic ratio in Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films, forming a favorable band structure which is conducive to carrier transport. Meanwhile, the adjusted element distribution not only ensures the uniformity of grain structure, but also increases the Se content of the films and suppress sulfur vacancy defects. Ultimately, the device delivers a high efficiency of 10.55&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported efficiency of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells. This study provides an effective strategy towards manipulating the element distribution in mixed-anion compound films prepared by solution-based method to optimize their optical and electrical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for synthesizing thioesters from readily available aryl halides and carboxylic acids is here disclosed. This thiol&#8208;free protocol hinges on the direct excitation of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylthiourea and its multifaceted ability to act as the sulfur source, generate aryl radicals upon SET activation of halides, and trap them to in situ produce reactive isothiouronium ions.







Abstract
Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.

         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Carbooxygenation for the Construction of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Centers: Application to the Synthesis of Hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy to access hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones via i)&#8197;aerobic radical cyclization, ii)&#8197;allylation, and iii)&#8197;translactonization has been developed. The key to this sequence is the highly diastereoselective aerobic carbooxygenation based on the integration of endothermic intramolecular radical addition to geminally disubstituted alkenes with exothermic oxygenation to synthesize &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones.







Abstract
Strategic design for the construction of contiguous tetrasubstituted carbon centers represents a daunting challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational investigation aimed at developing catalytic aerobic carbooxygenation, involving the intramolecular addition of tertiary radicals to geminally disubstituted alkenes, followed by aerobic oxygenation. This reaction provides a straightforward route to various &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones, which can be readily transformed into hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones through allylation/translactonization. Computational analysis reveals that the key mechanistic foundation for achieving the developed aerobic carbooxygenation involves the design of endothermic (energetically uphill) C&#8722;C bond formation followed by exothermic (energetically downhill) oxygenation. Furthermore, we highlight a unique fluorine&#8208;induced stereoelectronic effect that stabilizes the endothermic stereodetermining transition state.

         <title>Construction of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Poly(heptazine Imide) Nanosheets via Hydrogen Bonds for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(heptazine imide) polymer photocatalyst, functionalized with hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs (HM&#8208;FLPs), is developed for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction. The HM&#8208;FLPs enable efficient separation of photogenerated charges, delocalization of electron clouds and selective CO2 deoxygenation in the ambient system.







Abstract
The creation of frustrated Lewis pairs on catalyst surface is an effective strategy for tuning CO2 activation. The critical step in the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs is the spatial effect of proximal Lewis acid&#8208;Lewis base pairs. Here, we demonstrate a facile surface functionalization methodology that enables hydrogen bonding between N and H atoms to mediate the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs in poly(heptazine imide), thereby increasing the propensity to activate CO2 molecules. Experimental and theoretical results show that the construction of active hydrogen bonding regions can facilitate the bending of CO2 molecules. Furthermore, the delocalization of electron clouds induced by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs can promote the heterolytic cleavage and photocatalytic conversion of CO2. This work highlights the potential of utilizing hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated strategy in heterogeneously photocatalytic activation of CO2 over polymer materials.

         <title>Interpretable Data&#8208;Driven Descriptors for Establishing the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a workflow that combines artificial&#8208;intelligence data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery method with density&#8208;functional theory calculations to find descriptors of catalytic activity of Ni&#8208;based MOFs in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The identified data&#8208;driven descriptors do not only guide the rational design of efficient MOF&#8208;based catalysts, but also provide physical insights overarching existing knowledge on physical factors governing OER catalysis by MOFs.







Abstract
The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Through an artificial&#8208;intelligence (AI) data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d&#8208;band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3&#8211;5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF&#8208;based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;Doping Enables Significant Suppression of Conformational Relaxation and Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay for Improved Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study found a solvent atmosphere&#8208;induced suppression of intermolecular and intramolecular nonradiative decay (interNR &amp; intraNR) of a perylene diimide (PDI) derivative, inspiring the development of alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to boost the photoluminescence (PL) of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR probing and long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor.







Abstract
Despite various efforts to optimize the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) performance of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives for bio&#8208;imaging, convenient and efficient strategies to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivatives in biological environment and the intrinsic mechanism studies are still lacking. Herein, we propose an alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR fluorescence imaging.

&lt;p&gt;This study found a solvent atmosphere-induced suppression of intermolecular and intramolecular nonradiative decay (interNR &amp;amp; intraNR) of a perylene diimide (PDI) derivative, inspiring the development of alkyl-doping strategy to boost the photoluminescence (PL) of PDI derivative-based nanoparticles for improved NIR probing and long-term monitoring of tumor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite various efforts to optimize the near-infrared (NIR) performance of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives for bio-imaging, convenient and efficient strategies to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivatives in biological environment and the intrinsic mechanism studies are still lacking. Herein, we propose an alkyl-doping strategy to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivative-based nanoparticles for improved NIR fluorescence imaging. The developed PDI derivative, OPE-PDI, shows much brighter in n-Hexane (HE) compared with that in other organic media, and the excited state dynamics investigation experimentally elucidates the solvent effect-induced suppression of intermolecular energy transfer and intramolecular nonradiative decay as the underlying mechanism for the fluorescence improvement. Theoretical calculations reveal the lowest reorganization energies of OPE-PDI in HE among various solvents, indicating the effectively suppressed conformational relaxation to support the strongest radiative decay. Inspired by this, an alkyl atmosphere mimicking HE is constructed by incorporating the octadecane into OPE-PDI-based nanoparticles, permitting up to 3-fold fluorescence improvement compared with the counterpart nanoparticles. Owing to the merits of high brightness, anti-photobleaching, and low biotoxicity for the optimal nanoparticles, they have been employed for probing and long-term monitoring of tumor. This work highlights a facile strategy for the fluorescence enhancement of PDI derivative-based nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Doped Bismuth Nanosheet Catalyst for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Electrolyte&#8208;Free Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous solid electrolyte reactor efficiently produces pure formic acid (HCOOH) for over 100&#8197;h. The produced HCOOH can be utilized as chemical feedstock and in other applications.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO&#8722;) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal&#8208;doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high&#8208;purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal&#8208;doped Bi catalysts, Co&#8208;doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90&#8201;% HCOO&#8722; selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0&#8197;V at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co&#8208;doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72&#8201;% after a 100&#8208;hour operation under a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, generating 0.1&#8197;M HCOOH at 3.2&#8197;V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co&#8208;doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester and maleic anhydride was found to work as a catalyst for direct esterification of alcohol and carboxylic acid. The key to the unprecedented catalytic activity was the activation of carboxylic anhydride by adjacent boron, and the catalytic function through the cooperation of side chains would collect attention as the simple mimic of enzyme.







Abstract
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Activated Norbornenyl Esters&#8212;A Versatile Platform for Functional Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester is reported, which yielded an active ester&#8208;containing platform material that could undergo post&#8208;polymerization modification with primary amines under mild conditions. Modification with &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, and allylamine allowed preparation of nanoparticles, coated surfaces, and cross&#8208;linked networks, respectively.







Abstract
Elemental sulfur has shown to be a promising alternative feedstock for development of novel polymeric materials with high sulfur content. However, the utilization of inverse vulcanized polymers is restricted by the limitation of functional comonomers suitable for an inverse vulcanization. Control over properties and structure of inverse vulcanized polymers still poses a challenge to current research due to the dynamic nature of sulfur&#8208;sulfur bonds and high temperature of inverse vulcanization reactions. In here, we report for the first time the inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester (NB&#8208;PFPE), allowing for post&#8208;modification of inverse vulcanized polymers via amidation of reactive PFP esters to yield high sulfur content polymers under mild conditions. Amidation of the precursor material with three functional primary amines (&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, allylamine) was investigated. The resulting materials were applicable as sulfur containing poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles in aqueous environment. Cross&#8208;linked mercury adsorbents, sulfur surface coatings, and high&#8208;sulfur content networks with predictable thermal properties were achievable using aminopropyl trimethoxy silane and allylamine for post&#8208;polymerization modification, respectively. With the broad range of different amines available and applicable for post&#8208;polymerization modification, the versatility of poly(sulfur&#8208;random&#8208;NB&#8208;PFPE) as a platform precursor polymer for novel specialized sulfur containing materials was showcased.

         <title>Triindenotriphenylenes: Spin&#8208;Frustrated Triskelion Triradicals with Excellent Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped triindenotriphenylene triradicals with spin&#8208;frustrated doublet ground states are distinguished by good stability in air and a concise synthesis. The accessibility of several ionic forms of these hydrocarbons that possess strong infrared absorption bands was demonstrated.







Abstract
A triskelion&#8208;shaped triradical triindeno[1,2&#8208;a:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;g&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;m]triphenylen&#8208;7&#8208;yl (1) and its internally fused derivative (2) obtained by oxidative cyclization were prepared in a straightforward synthetic sequence. Both compounds were confirmed to be triradicals and to possess intramolecular antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between spins, displaying a spin&#8208;frustrated doublet ground state with doublet&#8208;quartet energy gaps of &#8722;0.14&#8197;kcal/mol for 1 and &#8722;0.06&#8197;kcal/mol for 2. Despite their open&#8208;shell character, they were sufficiently stable to be handled under ambient conditions on a timescale of days. Both compounds could be reversibly reduced to mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trianions and oxidized to 1+ and 22+, with strong NIR absorptions (1800 to over 3200&#8197;nm) observed for all open&#8208;shell ions.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu(I)&#8208;glutathione polymer supported on ZIF&#8208;8 is a robust catalyst for the efficient carboxylation of terminal alkynes and the cyclization of propargylamine with CO2 under atmospheric pressure and mild conditions with a wide range of substrates, converting them into high value&#8208;added chemicals, with strong positive synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst is reused at least 10&#8197;times without significant reduction in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT calculation, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10&#8197;times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>General In Situ Engineering of Carbon&#8208;Based Materials on Carbon Fiber for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ engineering strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of functional carbon fibers was developed by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. This strategy overcomes complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoids the delamination of the modification layer, enabling the fabrication and integration of neurochemical microsensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability.







Abstract
Developing real&#8208;time, dynamic, and in situ analytical methods with high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial for exploring biochemical processes in the brain. Although in vivo electrochemical methods based on carbon fiber (CF) microelectrodes are effective in monitoring neurochemical dynamics during physiological and pathological processes, complex post modification hinders large&#8208;scale productions and widespread neuroscience applications. Herein, we develop a general strategy for the in situ engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials to mass&#8208;produce functional CFs by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors, followed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. This strategy demonstrates exceptional universality and design flexibility, overcoming complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoiding the delamination of the modification layer. This simplifies the fabrication and integration of functional CF&#8208;based microelectrodes. Moreover, we design highly stable and selective H+, O2, and ascorbate microsensors and monitor the influence of CO2 exposure on the O2 content of the cerebral tissue during physiological and ischemia&#8208;reperfusion pathological processes.

         <title>Atomic Level&#8208;Macroscopic Structure&#8208;Activity of Inhomogeneous Localized Aggregates Enabled Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hybrid Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micelle&#8208;like structure electrolyte in macroscopic activity is proposed, featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates. Enabled by low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions, this electrolyte offers exceptional solubility, wide electrochemical window, low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) zinc ion conductivity in aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of hybrid aqueous electrolytes has significantly broadened the electrochemical and temperature ranges of aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the design principles for extreme operating conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically unveil the ternary interaction involving salt&#8208;water&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents and its intricate impacts on both the atomic&#8208;level and macroscopic structural features of the hybrid electrolytes. This highlights a distinct category of micelle&#8208;like structure electrolytes featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates, enabled by appropriate low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions. Remarkably, the electrolyte enables exceptional high solubility, accommodating up to 29.8&#8197;m zinc triflate within aqueous micelles. This configuration maintains an intra&#8208;micellar salt&#8208;in&#8208;water setup, allowing for a broad electrochemical window (up to 3.86&#8197;V), low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultralow&#8208;temperature zinc ion conductivity (1.58&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Building upon the unique nature of the inhomogeneous localized aggregates, this micelle&#8208;like electrolyte facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping, even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled Zn||PANI battery showcases an impressive capacity of 71.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extended lifespan of over 3000 cycles at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. This study opens up a promising approach in electrolyte design that transcends conventional local atomic solvation structures, broadening the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte concept.

         <title>Supramolecular Modifying Nafion with Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Functionalized Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Selective Proton Conduction.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate nanoclusters are used as supramolecular additives to precisely modify the ionic domains of Nafion, which can increase the proton conductivity and selectivity simultaneously. The resulting hybrid membranes show significantly enhanced power density in fuel cells and improved energy efficiency in vanadium flow batteries.







Abstract
Proton exchange membranes with high selectivity are urgently required in energy and electronic technologies. Although Nafion represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial proton exchange membrane material,it still suffers from the permeation of undesirable substances, like hydrogen in fuel cells and vanadium ions in redox flow batteries, due to the unmatched sizes between its ionic domains (3&#8211;5&#8197;nm) and these substances. In this work, we present a supramolecular modification strategy that simultaneously enhances the proton conductivity and selectivity of Nafion. We employ fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate (POMs) nanoclusters as supramolecular additives to modify Nafion via co&#8208;assembly. These POMs can precisely and robustly decorate at Nafion ionic domains, with their fluoroalkyl chains anchoring into the perfluorinated matrix while their inorganic clusters stay in the ionic regions. The hybrid membranes, with continuous proton hopping sites and nanoscale steric hindrance offered by POMs, exhibit a 56&#8201;% increase in proton conductivity and a 100&#8201;% improvement in proton/vanadium selectivity. This leads to significantly enhanced power density and energy efficiency in fuel cells and vanadium flow batteries, respectively. These results underscore the intriguing potential of molecular cluster additives in improving the functions of ion&#8208;conducting membranes.

         <title>Poly(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)&#8208;Capped Alloy and Core&#8208;Shell AuAg Bimetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) are used to covalently immobilize Au and Ag atoms to yield bimetallic random copolymers. Reduction of such polymers results in the formation of polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8211;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles whose structures are governed by the relative metal content in their corresponding metallopolymers. The application of these nanomaterials in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted considerable attention. While most efforts in the field have been devoted to the development of NHC&#8208;tethered monometallic NPs and enhancing their stabilities under various conditions, their bimetallic counterparts are rare in the literature. Herein, we demonstrate that the covalent immobilization of Au and Ag atoms on polymerized NHCs is a powerful method to access bimetallic AuAg NPs. In addition, we show that while AuAg alloy NPs are often obtained via this method, the use of bimetallic polymeric substrates with lower Ag content, relative to Au, results in the formation of core&#8211;shell NPs with Au core and Ag shell. Application of these nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated with all materials exhibiting electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates for the first time that while bimetallic poly(NHC&#8208;metal)s are viable substrates to access NHC&#8208;stabilized bimetallic NPs, careful adjustment of metal content in the polymeric substrates can finetune the microstructure of the resulting NPs, i.e. alloy vs. core&#8211;shell.

In addition, we show that while AuAg alloy NPs are often obtained via this method, the use of bimetallic polymeric substrates with lower Ag content, relative to Au, results in the formation of core&#8211;shell NPs with Au core and Ag shell. Application of these nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated with all materials exhibiting electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates for the first time that while bimetallic poly(NHC-metal)s are viable substrates to access NHC-stabilized bimetallic NPs, careful adjustment of metal content in the polymeric substrates can finetune the microstructure of the resulting NPs, i.e. alloy vs. core&#8211;shell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the coupling of N&#8208;nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids.







Abstract
A strategy for transition metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl nitroso&#8208;carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The N&#8208;nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp3&#8722;Csp2 cross&#8208;coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

         <title>A Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Terarylene Hybrid: Visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II Absorption via Sequential Photochromic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photochromic molecule that consists of HABI and terarylene exhibits the sequential four&#8208;state photochromism. The delocalization of a &#960;&#8208;electron spin on the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system of the terarylene unit is crucially efficient in increasing the photosensitivity to NIR&#8208;II light. A recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer.







Abstract
A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi&#8208;state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four&#8208;state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8722;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring&#8208;closing reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system in the terarylene unit, leading to two terarylene radical molecules. The photogenerated terarylene radical further exhibits the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization reaction by UV irradiation. The delocalized &#960;&#8208;radical on the closed&#8208;ring form of the terarylene is efficient to enhance the photosensitivity to the NIR&#8722;I and &#8208;II region. Furthermore, a recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer as a structural isomer of the initial molecule. This is a consequence of the sequential hybrid photochromic system involving the HABI and terarylene units.

         <title>Modifying the Charge&#8208;Density of Tetrahedral Cobalt(II) Centers through Carbon&#8208;Layer Modulation Promotes C&#8208;H Activation in the Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction (PDH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer, which is generated from the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt sites, decreases the charge density of tetrahedral cobalt(II) centers, which makes the d&#8208;band center closer to the Fermi level, thus facilitating C&#8722;H activation in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
The electronic structure of active metal centers plays an indispensable role in regulating catalytic reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis, developing other metals as promoters to decorate electronic state is a common strategy, while non&#8208;metal component of carbon as electronic additives to regulate d&#8208;band center has rarely been studied in thermal&#8208;catalysis field. Herein, we report electron&#8208;deficient tetrahedral Co(II) (Td&#8208;cobalt(II)) centers through carbon&#8208;layer modulation for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is indicated that bifunctional sites of both Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and metallic&#8208;cobalt are designed, and the in situ generated carbon through the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt can cover the inactive metallic&#8208;cobalt and tailor d&#8208;band of active Td&#8208;cobalt(II) simultaneously. More importantly, the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer is proposed to decrease electron density of Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and make d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level, consequently promotes C&#8722;H activation in PDH reaction. This study provides new perspective for the utilization of inactive carbon as electronic promoters and unlocks new opportunity to fabricate efficient PDH and other heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence from Dual&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptors in a single molecule led to a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers that displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands, and single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized light (CPL) with |glum| of 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on those emitters exhibited single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with |gEL| of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and EQEmax of up to 15.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
The strategy of integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptors in a single molecule was proposed to construct white circularly polarized luminescence (WCPL) materials in this work. Consequently, a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers, namely (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ, were designed and synthesized, which displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands in solution and solid films with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.30, 0.33) and (0.33, 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ exhibited a high PLQY of up to 67&#8201;% in doped films and clear mirror&#8208;image WCPL signals with a |glum| value of 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. Moreover, white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) based on organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ as emitters were also achieved with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.37) and EQEmax of 4.7&#8201;%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level of white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters. By optimizing the device structure, warm WCPEL devices were further obtained with a |gEL| value of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;3, CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.48) and EQEmax of up to 15.6&#8201;%. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters.

         <dc:description>
A novel platform of P,N&#8208;coordinating phosphine ligands featuring an ylide substituent with an aminophosphonium group is reported. The ligands are easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and highly modular enabling a facile adjustment of their electronic and steric properties as well as the N&#8208;donor strength. This flexibility allowed the development of a mild and highly efficient protocol for the selective monoarylation of acetone, ketones, amides, ammonia and amines.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of small nucleophiles are of great interest, but challenging due to difficulties in selectivity control. Herein, we report the development of a new platform of P,N&#8208;ligands consisting of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines with aminophosphonium groups (NYPhos) to address this challenge. These phosphine ligands are easily accessible in a wide structural diversity with highly modular electronic and steric properties. Based on a family of 14 ligands the selective monoarylation of acetone as well as other challenging ketones and amides was accomplished with record&#8208;setting activities even for aryl chlorides at room temperature including late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug molecules. Moreover, ammonia and other small primary amines could be coupled at mild conditions. Isolation and structure analyses of palladium complexes within the catalytic cycle confirmed that the P,N&#8208;coordination mode is necessary to achieve the observed selectivities. It also demonstrated the facile adjustability of the N&#8208;donor strength, which is beneficial for the targeted design of tailored P,N&#8208;ligands for future applications.

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Intermediates of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SAzyme via Second&#8208;Shell Coordination for Selective Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from the refined structures of cytochromes P450 with tetrapyrrolic FeN4 active sites and sulfur&#8208;containing ligand, we report Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SAzyme with tunable second&#8208;shell sulfur&#8208;functionalization could regulate ROS production pathways. It was disclosed such functionalization enhanced electron transfer from active sites in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby determining the type of ROS in aerobic reactions.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation for single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), e.g., Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, is a key scientific issue that determines the activity, selectivity, and stability of aerobic reaction. However, the poor understanding of ROS formation mechanism on SAzymes greatly hampers their wider deployment. Herein, inspired by cytochromes P450 affording bound ROS intermediates in O2 activation, we report Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C containing the same FeN4 but with tunable second&#8208;shell coordination can effectively regulate ROS production pathways. Remarkably, compared to the control Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sample, the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalized Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C delivered a 2.4&#8208;fold increase of oxidase&#8208;like activity via the bound Fe=O intermediate. Conversely, free ROS (&#8901;O2&#8722;) release was significantly reduced after functionalization, down to only 17&#8201;% of that observed for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C. The detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalization significantly altered the electronic structure of FeN4 sites, leading to an increase of electron density at Fermi level. It enhanced the electron transfer from active sites to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the type of ROS in aerobic oxidation process. The proposed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with different second&#8208;shell anion were further applied to three aerobic oxidation reactions with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability.

         <title>Trace Fluorinated Carbon Dots Driven Li&#8208;Garnet Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pristine garnet surface exhibits poor wettability with Li metal, resulting in the formation of voids and gaps at the garnet/Li interface, which contributes to uneven electric field distribution and further leads to Li dendrite formation. A straightforward method is presented to construct a Li&#8208;FCD composite for garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries by the reaction between molten Li and a trace amount of FCDs (0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The Li&#8208;FCD composite transforms the weak interface connection into intimate contact with garnet and inhibits electron leakage, thereby enhancing Li+ transfer across the interface and promoting dendrite&#8208;free operation.







Abstract
Garnet solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) holds significant promise. However, the practical utilization has been seriously impeded by the poor contact of Li|garnet and electron leakage. Herein, one new type of garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state battery is proposed with high performance through the disparity in interfacial energy, induced by the reaction between trace fluorinated carbon dots (FCDs) and Li. The work of adhesion of Li|garnet is increased by the acquired Li&#8208;FCD composite, which facilitates an intimate Li|garnet interface with the promoted uniform Li+ deposition, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is further validated that a concentrated C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF component at the Li|garnet interface is spontaneously constructed, due to the significant disparity in interfacial energy between C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF|LLZTO and C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF|Li. Furthermore, The electron transport and Li dendrites penetration are effectively hindered by the formed Li2O and LiF. The Li&#8208;FCD|LLZTO|Li&#8208;FCD symmetrical cells demonstrate stable cycling performance for over 3000&#8197;hours at 0.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the LFP|garnet|Li&#8208;FCD full cell exhibits remarkable cycling performance (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C). Our research has revealed a novel approach to establish a dendrite&#8208;free Li|garnet interface, laying the groundwork for future advancements in garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Antifouling Asymmetric Block Copolymer Nanofilms via Freestanding Interfacial Polymerization for Efficient and Sustainable Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This freestanding IP fabrication approach eventually endows the resultant asymmetric BCP nanofilms with far higher PEG brushes grafting ratio and highly denser hydrophilic PEG layer compared to conventional surface post&#8208;modification, leading to not only superior water permeability and ion selectivity, but also extraordinary antifouling capability far beyond commercial polyamide membranes in water purification.







Abstract
Membrane materials that resist nonspecific or specific adsorption are urgently required in widespread practical applications, such as water purification, food processing, and life sciences. In water purification, inevitable membrane fouling not only limits membrane separation performance, leading to a decline in both permeance and selectivity, but also remarkably increases operation requirements, and augments extra maintenance costs and higher energy consumption. In this work, we report a freestanding interfacial polymerization (IP) fabrication strategy for in situ creation of asymmetric block copolymer (BCP) nanofilms with antifouling properties, greatly outperforming the conventional surface post&#8208;modification approaches. The resultant free&#8208;standing asymmetric BCP nanofilms with highly&#8208;dense, highly&#8208;hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) brushes on one side, can be readily formed via a typical IP process of a well&#8208;defined double&#8208;hydrophilic BCP composed of a highly&#8208;efficient antifouling PEG block and a membrane&#8208;forming multiamine block. The asymmetric BCP nanofilms have been applied for efficient and sustainable natural water purification, demonstrating extraordinary antifouling capabilities accompanied with superior separation performance far beyond commercial polyamide nanofiltration membranes. The antifouling behaviors of asymmetric BCP nanofilms derived from the combined effect of the hydration layer, electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were further elucidated by water flux and fouling resistance in combination with all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This work opens up a new avenue for the large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost creation of broad&#8208;spectrum, asymmetric membrane materials with diverse functional &#8220;defect&#8208;free&#8221; surfaces in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Complex of Cucurbit[7]uril with Diketopyrrolopyrole Dye: Fluorescence Boost, Biolabeling and Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright and stable assembly of cucurbit[7]uril as a host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) as a guest was functionalized. In conjugates with proteins, DPP dye shows up to 12&#8208;fold emission gain upon addition of CB7. In two&#8208;color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595&#8197;nm or 655&#8197;nm STED depletion lasers, the presence of CB7 is recommended for improving brightness and image quality. With CB7, DPP dye becomes cell&#8208;permeable.

New photostable and bright supramolecular complexes based on cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) guest dyes having two positively charged 4&#8208;(trimethylammonio)phenyl groups were prepared and characterized. The dye core displays large Stokes shift (in H2O, abs./emission max. 480/550&#8197;nm; &#1013;~19&#8201;000, &#964;fl&gt;4 ns), strong binding with the host (~560&#8197;nM Kd) and a linker affording fluorescence detection of bioconjugates with antibody and nanobody. Combination of protein&#8208;functionalized DPP dye with CB7 improves photostability and affords up to 12&#8208;fold emission gain. Two&#8208;color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595&#8197;nm or 655&#8197;nm STED depletion lasers shows that the presence of CB7 not only leads to improved brightness and image quality, but also results in DPP becoming cell&#8208;permeable.

&lt;p&gt;Bright and stable assembly of cucurbit[7]uril as a host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) as a guest was functionalized. In conjugates with proteins, DPP dye shows up to 12-fold emission gain upon addition of CB7. In two-color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595&#8197;nm or 655&#8197;nm STED depletion lasers, the presence of CB7 is recommended for improving brightness and image quality.

         <title>Enhanced UV Nonlinear Optical Properties in Layered Germanous Phosphites through Functional Group Sequential Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide nonlinear optical crystal, GeHPO3, featuring a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, has been successfully synthesized through an innovative strategy of sequential functional group construction. It achieves an optimal balance in the UV solar&#8208;blind region, demonstrating extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation&#8212;10.3&#8197;times that of KDP&#8212;with a short UV absorption edge at 211&#8197;nm and moderate birefringence measured at 0.062 at 546&#8197;nm.







Abstract
This study pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals through functional groups sequential construction, effectively addressing the inherent trade&#8208;offs among broad transmittance, enhanced second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and optimal birefringence. We have developed two innovative van der Waals layered germanous phosphites: GeHPO3, the first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide NLO crystal which exhibits a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, and K(GeHPO3)2Br, distinguished by its exceptional birefringence and graphene&#8208;like structure. Significantly, GeHPO3 exhibits a remarkable array of NLO properties, including the highest SHG coefficient recorded among all NLO crystals for phase&#8208;matching and generating 266&#8197;nm coherent light via quadruple frequency conversion. It delivers a potent SHG intensity, surpassing KH2PO4 (KDP) by 10.3&#8197;times at 1064&#8197;nm and &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 by 1.3&#8197;times at 532&#8197;nm, complemented by a distinct UV absorption edge at 211&#8197;nm and moderate birefringence of 0.062 at 546&#8197;nm. Comprehensive theoretical analysis links these exceptional characteristics to the unique NLO&#8208;active GeO34&#8722; units and the distinctive, highly ordered layered structures. Our findings deliver essential experimental insights into the development of Ge(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic materials and present a strategic blueprint for engineering structure&#8208;driven functional materials with customized properties.

         <title>Strained Au skin on Mesoporous Intermetallic AuCu3 Nanocoral for Electrocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia across a Wide Concentration Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered mesoporous intermetallic AuCu3 nanocoral with ultrathin strained Au&#8208;skin layer (meso&#8208;i&#8208;AuCu3@ultra&#8208;Au) was synthesized as an efficient and concentration&#8208;universal NitRR catalyst. The unique structure of catalyst not only offers a substantial exposed active area and enhances electron/mass transfer kinetics, but also effectively modulates the surface electronic structure to optimize the adsorption behavior of different intermediates (*NOx&#8722; and *H) and facilitate the hydrogenation process over a wide concentration range.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) uses nitrate from wastewater, offering a hopeful solution for environmental issues and ammonia production. Yet, varying nitrate levels in real wastewater greatly affect NitRR, slowing down its multi&#8208;step process. Herein, a multi&#8208;strategy approach was explored through the design of ordered mesoporous intermetallic AuCu3 nanocorals with ultrathin Au skin (meso&#8208;i&#8208;AuCu3@ultra&#8208;Au) as an efficient and concentration&#8208;versatile catalyst for NitRR. The highly penetrated structure, coupled with the compressive stress exerted on the skin layer, not only facilitates rapid electron/mass transfer, but also effectively modulates the surface electronic structure, addressing the concentration&#8208;dependent challenges encountered in practical NitRR process. As expected, the novel catalyst demonstrates outstanding NitRR activities and Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 95&#8201;% across a real and widespread concentration range (10&#8211;2000&#8197;mM). Notably, its performance at each concentration matched or exceeded that of the best&#8208;known catalyst designed for that concentration. Multiple operando spectroscopies unveiled the catalyst concurrently optimized the adsorption behavior of different intermediates (adsorbed *NOx and *H) while expediting the hydrogenation steps, leading to an efficient overall reduction process. Moreover, the catalyst also displays promising potential for use in ammonia production at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities and in conceptual zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries, serving trifunctional nitrate conversion, ammonia synthesis and power supply.

         <dc:description>The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Micro/meso&#8208;porous Double&#8208;shell Hollow Carbon Spheres through Spatially Confined Pyrolysis for Supercapacitors and Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy storage in supercapacitors and hybrid zinc ion capacitors (ZIC) using porous carbon materials offers a promsing alternative method for clean energy solutions. The unique combination of hierarchical porous structure and nitrogen doping in these materials has demonstrated significant capacity for energy storage. Nevertheless, the full potential of these materials, particularly the relationship between pore structure configuration and performance, remains underexplored. Herein, a confined pyrolysis strategy based on the polymerization characteristics of polydopamine (PDA) was developed to construction of hollow carbon spheres with microporous/mesoporous dual shell structure. The depth of micropores and cavity can be controlled by adjusting the duration of heat treatment and hydrothermal treatment, in accordance with the decomposition and polymerization characteristics of PDA. Due to the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and ZIC is established. Through optimizing the ion transport capacity of carbon spheres and considering the influence of its internal cavity structure on energy storage, the resulting carbon spheres exhibit high specific capacitance of 389 F g&#8208;1 in supercapacitor and specific capacitance of 260 F g&#8722;1 and excellent stability with 99.3% retention after 30000 chare/discharge cycles in ZIC.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Deficiency is More Important than Conductivity in C&#8722;N Coupling for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species. The electron&#8208;deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C&#8722;N coupling reactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron-deficient Cu sites by the strong metal-polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron-deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron-deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen-containing species.

         <title>Solar&#8208;driven Methanogenesis through Microbial Ecosystem Engineering on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;biological photosynthesis combines synthetic photosensitizers with microbial catalysts to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals from CO2. However, the inefficient transfer of photoexcited electrons to microbes leads to limited CO2 utilization, restricting the catalytic performance of such biohybrid assemblies. Here, we introduce a biological engineering solution to address the inherently sluggish electron uptake mechanism of a methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri), by coculturing it with an electron transport specialist, Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400), an adapted strain rich with multiheme c&#8208;type cytochromes (c&#8208;Cyts) and electrically conductive protein filaments (e&#8208;PFs) made of polymerized c&#8208;Cyts with enhanced capacity for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Integration of this M. barkeri&#8208;KN400 co&#8208;culture with a synthetic photosensitizer, carbon nitride, demonstrates that c&#8208;Cyts and e&#8208;PFs, emanating from live KN400, transport photoexcited electrons efficiently from the carbon nitride to M. barkeri for methanogenesis with remarkable long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. The demonstrated cooperative interaction between two microbes via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and the photosensitizer to assemble a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst introduces an ecosystem engineering strategy in photocatalysis to drive sustainable chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool&#8217;s ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host&#8217;s mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast and Coherent Dynamics in a Solvent Switchable "Pink Box" Perylene Diimide Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene diimide (PDI) dimers and higher aggregates are key components in organic molecular photonics and photovoltaic devices, supporting singlet fission and symmetry breaking charge separation. Detailed understanding of their excited states is thus important. This has proven challenging because interchromophoric coupling is a strong function of dimer architecture. Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. Spectral analysis resolves the different coupling strengths, which are consistent with solvent dependent changes in dimer conformation. The strongly coupled conformer forms an excimer within 300 fs. The low&#8208;frequency Raman active modes recovered from two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectra reveal frequencies characteristic of exciton coupling. These are assigned to modes modulating the coupling from the corresponding DFT calculations. Further analysis reveals a time dependent frequency during excimer formation. Analysis of two&#8208;dimensional &#8220;beatmaps&#8221; reveals features in the coupled dimer which are not predicted by the displaced harmonic oscillator model and are assigned to vibronic coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Gradient Interface for High&#8208;Rate PEO&#8208;based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based all solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are strongly hindered by the fast dendrite growth at the Li metal/electrolyte interface, especially under large rates. The above issue stems from the suboptimal interfacial chemistry and poor Li+ transport kinetics during cycling. Herein, a SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SCG&#8208;SEI) of LixSny/LiF&#8208;Li2O is in&#8208;situ formed. The superior ionic LiF&#8208;Li2O rich upper layer (17.1 nm) possesses high interfacial energy and fast Li+ diffusion channels, wherein lithiophilic LixSny alloy layer (8.4 nm) could highly reduce the nucleation overpotential with lower diffusion barrier and promote rapid electron transportation for reversible Li+ plating/stripping. Simultaneously, the insoluble SnF2&#8208;coordinated PEO promotes the rapid Li+ ion transport in the bulk phase. As a result, an over 46.7 and 3.5 times improvements for lifespan and critical current density of symmetrical cells are achieved, respectively. Furthermore, LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLMBs deliver a recorded cycling performance at 5 C (over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.0%). More importantly, impressive electrochemical performances and safety tests with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and pouch cell with LiFePO4, even under extreme conditions (i.e., 100 &#8451;), are also demonstrated, reconfirmed the importance of lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient interfacial chemistry in the design of high&#8208;rate ASSLMBs for safety applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, however, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23 V and 0.22 V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2 nGyair s&#8722;1 and 19.4 nGyair s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter&#8212;a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement&#8212;was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100 cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.</dc:description>

         <title>The Formation Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Carbonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs), as a kind of zero&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, have been widely synthesized by bottom&#8208;up methods from various precursors. However, the formation mechanism is still unclear and controversial, which also brings difficulty to the regulation of structures and properties. Only some tentative formation processes were postulated by analyzing the products obtained at different reaction times and temperatures. Here, the effect of crosslinking on the formation of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is explored. Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the driving force for the formation of CPDs. Under hydrothermal synthesis, the precursors are initiated to polymerize and crosslink. The crosslinking brings higher hydrophobicity to generate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation, which promotes dehydration and carbonization resulting in the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are also revealed. Moreover, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to support this formation mechanism. This concept of CINC will bring light to the formation process of CPDs, as well as facilitate the regulation of CPDs&#8217; size and photoluminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydroboration of C&#8722;C Single Bonds without Transition&#8208;metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds presents a fundamental challenge in the chemical industry. Previously, only catalytic systems utilizing precious metals Ir and Rh, in conjunction with N&#8208; and P&#8208; ligands, could achieve this, ensuring bond cleavage and selectivity. In sharp contrast, we discovered an unprecedented and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds. This methodology is transition&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;free and surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate versatility, or yields. In addition, our system tolerates various functional groups such as Ar&#8722;X (X = halides), heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, amides, nitro, nitriles, and C=C double bonds, which are typically susceptible to hydroboration in the presence of transition metals. As a result, a diverse range of &#947;&#8208;boronated amines with varied structures and functions has been readily obtained. Experimental mechanistic studies, density functional theory (DFT), and intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) calculations unveiled a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and hydride&#8208;shift reaction pathway. The carbonyl group of the amide suppresses dehydrogenation between the free N&#8722;H and hydroborane. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amide facilitates the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in cyclopropanes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 TxtE Model System with Mechanistic and Theoretical Evidence for a Heme Peroxynitrite Active Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytochrome P450 homolog, TxtE, efficiently catalyzes the direct and regioselective aromatic nitration of the indolyl moiety of L&#8208;tryptophan to 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, using nitric oxide&#160;and dioxygen&#160;as co&#8208;substrates. Pathways for such direct and selective nitration of heteroaromatic motifs present platforms for engineering new nitration biocatalysts for pharmacologically beneficial targets, among a medley of other pivotal industrial applications. Precise mechanistic details concerning this pathway are only weakly understood, albeit a heme iron(III)&#8208;peroxynitrite active species has been postulated. To shed light on this unique reaction landscape, we investigated the indole nitration pathway of a series of biomimetic ferric heme superoxide mimics, [(Por)FeIII(O2&#8211;&#8226;)], in the presence of NO. Therein, our model systems gave rise to three distinct nitroindole products, including 4&#8208;nitroindole, the product analogous to that obtained with TxtE. Moreover, 15N and 18O isotope labeling studies, along with meticulously designed control experiments lend credence to a heme peroxynitrite active nitrating agent, drawing close similarities to the tryptophan nitration mechanism of TxtE. All organic and inorganic reaction components have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods. Theoretical investigation into several mechanistic possibilities deem a unique indolyl radical based reaction pathway as the most energetically favorable, products of which, are in excellent agreement with experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolytic Depolymerization&#160;of Polyolefins Catalyzed by Zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes are the most&#8208;produced plastic waste globally, yet are difficult to convert into useful products due to their unreactivity. Pyrolysis is a practical method for large&#8208;scale treatment of mixed, contaminated plastic, allowing for their conversion into industrially&#8208;relevant petrochemicals. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), despite their tremendous utility in heterogenous catalysis, have been overlooked for polyolefin depolymerization due to their perceived thermal instabilities and inability of polyethylenes and polypropylenes to penetrate their pores. Herein, we demonstrate the viability of UiO&#8208;66 MOFs containing coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated zirconia nodes, as effective catalysts for pyrolysis that significantly enhances the yields of valuable liquid and gas hydrocarbons, whilst halving the amounts of residual solids produced. Reactions occur on the Lewis&#8208;acidic UiO&#8208;66 zirconia nodes, without the need for noble metals, and yields aliphatic product distributions distinctly different from the aromatic&#8208;rich hydrocarbons from zeolite catalysis. We also demonstrate the first unambiguous characterization of polyolefin penetration into UiO&#8208;66 pores at pyrolytic temperatures, allowing access to the abundant Zr&#8208;oxo nodes within the MOF interior for efficient C&#8208;C cleavage. Our work highlights the potential of MOFs as highly&#8208;designable heterogeneous catalysts for depolymerization of plastics which can complement conventional catalysts in reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180% coulombic efficiency and more than 90% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 100 hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130 mA cm&#8208;2 at a voltage of only 2.1 V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough, yet Rigid and Healable Supramolecular Polymers with Variable Stiffness for Multimodal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Variable stiffness materials have shown considerable application in soft robotics. However, previously reported materials often struggle to reconcile high stiffness, stretchability, toughness, and self&#8208;healing ability, because of the inherently conflicting requisite of these properties in molecular design. Herein, we propose a novel strategy that involves incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs capable of from strong crosslinking sites into a dense and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to construct rigid self&#8208;healing polymers with tunable stiffness and excellent toughness. To demonstrate these distinct features, the polymer was employed to serve as the strain&#8208;regulation layers within a fiber&#8208;reinforced pneumatic actuator (FPA). The exceptional synergy between the configuration versatility of FPA and the dynamic molecular behavior of the supramolecular polymers equips the actuator with simultaneous improvement in motion dexterity, multimodality, loading capacity, robustness, and durability. Additionally, the concept of integrating high dexterity at both macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale is prospective to inspire the design of intelligent yet robust devices across various domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Aldehyde End&#8208;Capped Degradable Polyethylenes from Hydrogen&#8208;Controlled Ethylene/CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in&#8208;chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen&#8208;controlled E/CO non&#8208;alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non&#8208;alternating in&#8208;chain keto groups (1.0&#8208;9.3 mol%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195 kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer&#8217;s molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non&#8208;alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non&#8208;alternating structure (&gt; 99%) for the keto&#8208;PE. The dispersed incorporation of in&#8208;chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel resonance&#8208;assisted self&#8208;doping mechanism has been demonstrated in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. The new class of compounds has a unique structure incorporating acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups into the ladder&#8208;type cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diimine core, enabling efficient proton transfer and self&#8208;doping without the need for external dopants. Mechanistic studies and computational studies confirm the open&#8208;shell, zwitterionic nature of the self&#8208;doped state and the significant role played by the dielectric environment. This new self&#8208;doping mechanism allows for higher stability and durability in the material's electronic performance. The self&#8208;doped form retains durability under harsh conditions and maintains its properties over extended periods of time.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the commercial use of biocatalysts, transitioning from energy&#8208;intensive traditional chemistries to more sustainable methods. Current enzyme engineering techniques, such as directed evolution, require the generation and testing of large mutant libraries to identify optimized variants. Unfortunately, conventional screening methods are unable to screen such large libraries in a robust and timely manner. Droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems have emerged as a powerful high&#8208;throughput tool for library screening at kilohertz rates. Unfortunately, almost all reported systems are based on fluorescence detection, restricting their use to a limited number of enzyme types that naturally convert fluorogenic substrates or require the use of surrogate substrates. To expand the range of enzymes amenable to evolution using droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems, we present an absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorter that allows of droplet sorting at kilohertz rates without the need for optical monitoring of the microfluidic system. To demonstrate the utility of the sorter, we rapidly screen a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library towards D&#8208;glyceraldehyde using a NADH mediated coupled assay that generates WST&#8208;1 formazan as the colorimetric product. We successfully identify a variant with a 51% improvement in catalytic efficiency and a significant increase in overall activity across a broad substrate spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(III) Auracycles Featuring C(sp3)&#8208;Au&#8208;C(sp2) Bonds: Synthesis and Mechanistic Insights into the Cycloauration Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel set of alkyl&#8208;gold(III) complexes is synthesized and their reactivity is explored. These species are susceptible to undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H auration under mild conditions. Experimental kinetics, Hammett analysis, activation parameters and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) suggest that the process occurs via electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) wherein the formation of a &#960;&#8208;complex might precede the formation of a Wheland intermediate.







Abstract
The direct auration of arenes is a key step in numerous gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Although reported more than 100&#8197;years ago, understanding of its underlying mechanism has been hampered by the difficulties in the isolation of relevant intermediates given the propensity of gold(III) species to undergo reductive elimination. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of a new family of intriguing zwitterionic [C(sp3)^C(sp2)]&#8208;auracyclopentanes, as well as of their alkyl&#8208;gold(III) precursors and demonstrate their value as mechanistic probes to study the C(sp2)&#8208;Au bond&#8208;forming event. Experimental investigations employing Kinetic Isotope Effects (KIE), Hammett plot, and Eyring analysis provided important insights into the formation of the auracycle. The data suggest a SEAr mechanism wherein the slowest step might be the &#960;&#8208;coordination between the arene and the gold(III) center, en route to the Wheland intermediate. We also show that these auracyclopentanes can work as catalysts in several gold&#8208;promoted transformations.

         <title>Altering the CO2 Electroreduction Pathways Towards C1 or C2+ Products via Engineering the Strength of Interfacial Cu&#8722;O Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the CO2RR pathways can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O&#8208;containing organic species. The C6O6&#8722;Cu catalysts with strong Cu&#8722;O bonds shows a dominant C1 pathway, while the C4O4&#8722;Cu with weaker Cu&#8722;O bonds shows enhanced capability of C&#8722;C coupling for C2+ production.







Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value&#8208;added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O&#8208;containing organic species (squaric acid (H2C4O4) and cyclohexanehexaone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu&#8722;O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6&#8722;Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4&#8722;Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu&#8208;atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8&#8201;% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C&#8722;C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10&#8197;h with a high current density of 205.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE, i.e., is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metabolism&#8208;inspired artificial system designed to respond to multiple stimuli, operating within an integrated network of mechanistically distinct reactions. Our approach enables the efficient performance of multi&#8208;stage processes using three simple starting materials, controlled by specific triggers, and catalysed by a multifunctional PdII/PtII complex, leading to the preferential synthesis of ten products.







Abstract
Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains thus far beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions&#8212;cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials&#8212;terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.

         <title>Reactive Solid Polymer Layer: From a Single Fluoropolymer to Divergent Fluorinated Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorosulfonyl fluoropolymer was designed as a reactive layer to stabilize Li metal anodes, which has not only enabled in situ generation of a hybrid polymer&#8208;inorganic interphase with controlled morphology and various desirable properties, but also furnished excellent protection during long&#8208;term cycling in lithium batteries.







Abstract
Controlling the structure and chemistry of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) underpins the stability of electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, and is crucial for advancing rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we utilized photo&#8208;controlled copolymerization to achieve the on&#8208;demand synthesis of fluorosulfonyl fluoropolymers as unprecedented artificial SEI layers on Li metal anodes. This work not only enables instant formation of a hybrid polymer&#8208;inorganic interphase that consists of a polymer&#8208;enriched top layer and a LiF&#8208;fortified bottom layer, originating from a single polymeric component, but also imparts various desirable physical properties (e.g., good mechanical strength and flexibility, high ion conductivity, low overpotential) to SEI via a single&#8208;to&#8208;divergent strategy. Model reactions and structural characterizations supported the formation of a divergent fluorinated interphase, which furnished prolonged stabilization of Li deposition, high coulombic efficiency and improved cycling behavior in electrochemical experiments. This work highlights the great potential of exploring reactive polymers as versatile coatings to stabilize Li metal anodes, providing a promising avenue to solve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial problems for LMBs.

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economically feasible strategy, simple hypercrosslinking, is proposed to construct ion exchange membranes with microporosity. The presented membranes balance well with high ion conductivity and high ion selectivity and show superiority in process simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and anti&#8208;swelling, thus enabling high&#8208;efficiency and stable cycling of pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries.







Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well&#8208;developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017&#8201;% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.

         <title>Stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII ions can be constructed using p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (H4TBC[4]) under solvothermal reaction conditions. The topological arrangement of the metal ions leads to significant spin frustration arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at 10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3 T.







Abstract
The solvothermal reaction of FeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O and H4TBC[4] in a basic dmf/EtOH solution affords an [FeIII18] Keplerate conforming to a stellated cuboctahedron. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements reveal spin frustration effects arising from the high symmetry.

&lt;p&gt;A stellated cuboctahedron of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions can be constructed using &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tert-butylcalix[4]arene (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TBC[4]) under solvothermal reaction conditions. The topological arrangement of the metal ions leads to significant spin frustration arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at 10&#8197;K for applied-field changes lower than 3 T.

         <title>Bilateral Chemical Linking at NiOx Buried Interface Enables Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilateral chemical manipulation for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells: A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral&#8208;bridge molecules is important to realize hyper stable and large&#8208;area inverted NiOx&#8208;based PSCs. The efficiencies of the as&#8208;prepared devices reached 25.05&#8201;% (0.05&#8197;cm2 area) with high fill factor of 86.24&#8201;% and 21.16&#8201;% (18&#8197;cm2 area), respectively.







Abstract
Inverted NiOx&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit considerable potential because of their low&#8208;temperature processing and outstanding excellent stability, while is challenged by the carriers transfer at buried interface owing to the inherent low carrier mobility and abundant surface defects that directly deteriorates the overall device fill factor. Present work demonstrates a chemical linker with the capability of simultaneously grasping NiOx and perovskite crystals by forming a Ni&#8722;S&#8722;Pb bridge at buried interface to significantly boost the carriers transfer, based on a rationally selected molecule of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;thione (NCS). The constructed buried interface not only reduces the pinholes and needle&#8208;like residual PbI2 at the buried interface, but also deepens the work function and valence band maximum positions of NiOx, resulting in a smaller VBM offset between NiOx and perovskite film. Consequently, the modulated PSCs achieved a high fill factor up to 86.24&#8201;%, which is as far as we know the highest value in records of NiOx&#8208;based inverted PSCs. The NCS custom&#8208;tailored PSCs and minimodules (active area of 18&#8197;cm2) exhibited a champion efficiency of 25.05&#8201;% and 21.16&#8201;%, respectively. The unencapsulated devices remains over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency at maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1700&#8197;hours.

         <title>Structural Optimization of Azacryptands for Targeting Three&#8208;Way DNA Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Great gig in the strands. We report on the characterization of azacryptands, small&#8208;molecule ligands that display high affinity and selectivity for a three&#8208;strand DNA structure known as a three&#8208;way DNA junction (TWJ), which makes them ideal molecular tools to interrogate the cellular relevance of TWJs and their potential as novel anticancer targets.







Abstract
Transient melting of the duplex&#8208;DNA (B&#8208;DNA) during DNA transactions allows repeated sequences to fold into non&#8208;B&#8208;DNA structures, including DNA junctions and G&#8208;quadruplexes. These noncanonical structures can act as impediments to DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, thereby triggering DNA damage and ultimately jeopardizing genomic stability. Their stabilization by ad hoc ligands is currently being explored as a putative anticancer strategy since it might represent an efficient way to inflict toxic DNA damage specifically to rapidly dividing cancer cells. The relevance of this strategy is only emerging for three&#8208;way DNA junctions (TWJs) and, to date, no molecule has been recognized as a reference TWJ ligand, featuring both high affinity and selectivity. Herein, we characterize such reference ligands through a combination of in vitro techniques comprising affinity and selectivity assays (competitive FRET&#8208;melting and TWJ Screen assays), functional tests (qPCR and Taq stop assays) and structural analyses (molecular dynamics and NMR investigations). We identify novel azacryptands TrisNP&#8208;amphi and TrisNP&#8208;ana as the most promising ligands, interacting with TWJs with high affinity and selectivity. These ligands represent new molecular tools to investigate the cellular roles of TWJs and explore how they can be exploited in innovative anticancer therapies.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Mediated Modulation of Spatial Internal Stresses of Hydrogels for Complex 3D Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of polyelectrolytes and polymer networks is used to regulate the spatial stress of hydrogels to construct complex actuators with customized 3D initial shapes capable of reversible deformation in response to external stimuli.







Abstract
Hydrogel actuators with complex 3D initial shapes show numerous important applications, but it remains challenging to fabricate such actuators. This article describes a polyelectrolyte&#8208;based strategy for modulating small&#8208;scale internal stresses within hydrogels to construct complex actuators with tailored 3D initial shapes. Introducing polyelectrolytes into precursor solutions significantly enhances the volume shrinkage of hydrogel networks during polymerization, allowing us to modulate internal stresses. Photopolymerization of these polyelectrolyte&#8208;containing solutions through a mask produces mechanically strong hydrogel sheets with large patterned internal stresses. Consequently, these hydrogel sheets attain complex 3D initial shapes at equilibrium, in contrast to the planar initial configuration of 2D actuators. We demonstrate that these 3D actuators can reversibly transform into other 3D shapes (i.e., 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape transformations) in response to external stimuli. Additionally, we develop a predictive model based on the Flory&#8208;Rehner theory to analyze the polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated shrinking behaviors of hydrogel networks during polymerization, allowing precise modulation of shrinkage and internal stress. This polyelectrolyte&#8208;boosted shrinking mechanism paves a route to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance 3D hydrogel actuators.

A new star in the catalyst sky: The cover illustration artistically depicts a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate catalyst as a constellation of stars in the firmament. This complex facilitates the conversion of aryl chlorides via a complex energy surface depicted as a mountain range. The THF solvent molecules are highlighted with a golden halo because they are a critical part of the catalyst system, enabling a stable bimetallic assembly of palladium and lithium. The catalysts are easily accessible from inexpensive components and allow various cross&#8208;couplings of non&#8208;activated aryl halides that were previously limited to phosphine or carbene systems, as reported by Lukas J. Goo&#223;en et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202408974). Design by Nele Kr&#252;ger and Dr. Jonas F. Goebel.

         <title>Back Cover: Copper&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi&#8208;Pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in tumors leads to insufficient infiltration of effector lymphocytes, significantly weakening the anti&#8208;tumor immune response and promoting the tumor to become &#8220;cold.&#8221; In the cover image, tumor cells are representend as icebergs, with organelles as ice blocks floating on the ice surface. The copper peptide nanoparticles are meteorites falling from the sky, attacking multiple organelles. The ice begins to melt, symbolizing the elicited multiple cell death pathways, and also indicating the transformation of cold tumors into hot tumors, as illustrated by Ling Wang, Jie Gao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406602).

&lt;p&gt;The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in tumors leads to insufficient infiltration of effector lymphocytes, significantly weakening the anti-tumor immune response and promoting the tumor to become &#8220;cold.&#8221; In the cover image, tumor cells are representend as icebergs, with organelles as ice blocks floating on the ice surface. The copper peptide nanoparticles are meteorites falling from the sky, attacking multiple organelles. The ice begins to melt, symbolizing the elicited multiple cell death pathways, and also indicating the transformation of cold tumors into hot tumors, as illustrated by Ling Wang, Jie Gao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202406602"&gt;e202406602&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Back Cover: A General Descriptor for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Axial Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general structure descriptor &#963; is constructed to quantify the structure&#8211;activity relationship of axial&#8208;coordination&#8208;ligand single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACL&#8208;SACs), as reported by Dapeng Cao, Xiao Cheng Zeng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407812). The &#963; is solely based on a few key intrinsic features and can provide a simple and quick way to screen efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Cucurbit[8]uril Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hetero&#8208;self&#8208;assembly is more challenging and meaningful compared to homo&#8208;self&#8208;assembly in many areas. In their Research Article (e202410130), Xu&#8208;Man Chen, Hong Yang, Quan Li et&#8197;al. present a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerization, which enables the occurrence of a rare cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated [2+2] heterocycloaddition under UV irradiation. The final product is found to be an unexpected [2]rotaxane, developing into a novel photochemical template synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Back Cover: Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical polyoxometalates, which are insulators, were successfully transformed into semiconductors by linking them with one&#8208;dimensional multinuclear platinum complexes. The assembles comprising two kinds of molecules are paramagnetic due to mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states, where unpaired electrons are delocalized over these backbones. Various derivatives with bandgap modulations are expected, represented by the flow of electricity in electronic circuits containing them, as reported by Kazuhiro Uemura et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407743).

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Multiphoton&#8208;driven Photocatalytic Defluorination of Persistent Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Polymers by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The process of PFAS decomposition (PFAS=perfluoroalkyl substances) into fluoride ions through the detachment of surface organic ligands and electron transfer reactions is induced by nonlinear optical reactions when visible light is irradiated onto semiconductor nanocrystals, as reported by Yoichi Kobayashi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408687). The bright sky in the background represents an image of a sustainable world achieved through the recycling of fluorine molecules.

         <title>Back Cover: Anomalous Structural Transformation of Cu(I) Clusters into Multifunctional CuAg Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping&#8208;induced kernel insertion in Cu(I) nanoclusters is reported by Qi Li et al. in their Research Article (e202407214). Its capability to create new types of copper&#8208;silver alloy nanoclusters with previously unreported structures, properties, and functionalities is uncovered. The as&#8208;obtained copper&#8208;silver nanocluster demonstrates high activity to initiate the photopolymerization of inorganic polymers in 3D laser microprinting.

         <title>Front Cover: Tailoring Metallosupramolecular Glycoassemblies for Enhancing Lectin Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly offers rational control over molecular properties through the careful selection and combination of subcomponents. In a Research Article from the Stauber lab (e202408751), this approach optimizes the binding strength of hybrid molecular glycoassemblies with protein targets by adjusting carbohydrate linking units, assembly size, and molecular charge. Similar to selecting the perfect combination of ingredients in a kitchen, this method allows for the customization of biomolecular binding properties through choice of the right molecular building blocks.

An on&#8208;demand antigen supply system was realized to precisely control the flux of antigens. On a flash of light, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#8208;Nef73&#8208;derived epitope was released from streptavidin. In their Research Article (e202405035), Robert Tamp&#233;, Ralph Wieneke et&#8197;al. utilized the photochemically induced &#8220;burst of antigens&#8221; to instantaneously initiate the translocation of peptides via ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters reconstituted in liposomes or microsomes of human origin.

         <title>Unsymmetric Chiral Ligands for Large Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles: Selectivity of Orientational Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand better and eventually mimic self&#8208;assembly processes occurring in nature, chiral, unsymmetric, and epimeric ligands based on bile acids and their coordination with Pd(II) ions have been studied. Structural analyses revealed the orientational self&#8208;sorting of the complexes into large supramolecular species, with sizes ranging from a small Pd2L4 up to a large Pd6L12 complex containing an impressive 120&#8197;chiral centers.







Abstract
Nature uses various chiral and unsymmetric building blocks to form substantial and complex supramolecular assemblies. In contrast, the majority of organic ligands used in metallosupramolecular chemistry are symmetric and achiral. Here we extend the group of unsymmetric chiral bile acids used as a scaffold for organic bispyridyl ligands by employing chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an epimer of the previously used ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The epimerism, flexibility, and bulkiness of the ligands leads to large structural differences in coordination products upon reaction with Pd(NO3)2. The UDCA&#8208;bispyridyl ligand self&#8208;assembles quantitatively into a single crown&#8208;like Pd3L6 complex, whereas the CDCA ligand provides a mixture of coordination complexes of general formula PdnL2n, i.e., Pd2L4, Pd3L6, Pd4L8, Pd5L10, and even Pd6L12 containing an impressive 120&#8197;chiral centers. The coordination products were studied by a combination of analytical methods, with ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) providing valuable details on their structure and allowed an effective separation of m/z 1461 to individual signals according to the arrival time distribution, thereby revealing four different ions of [Pd3L6(NO3)3]3+, [Pd4L8(NO3)4]4+, [Pd5L10(NO3)5]5+, and [Pd6L12(NO3)6]6+. The structures of all the complexes were modelled using DFT calculations. Finally, the challenges and conclusions in determining the specific structural identity of these unsymmetric species are discussed.

         <title>Depolymerization of Native Lignin over Thiol Capped Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Microbelts Mediated by Photogenerated Thiyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerization of native lignin for the production of functionalized aromatics was realized over irradiated colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 microbelts. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible colloidization&#8208;aggregation for both efficient reaction and facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for the generation of RS&#8901; for selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin.







Abstract
The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8&#8197;wt&#8201;% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8&#8197;h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the outer space, the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of several metalated porphyrins is exploited to form noncovalent Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interactions (M = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+). In the cover image, a dragon uses its nest as a template to assemble the metal ion into the porphyrin's core, interacting with it using the orbs located on the head and tail. In their Research Article (e202409963), Antonio Bauz&#225;, Ranjan Patra et&#8197;al. report novel metalated porphyrins, including a computational analysis of the interactions undertaken in the solid state.

         <dc:description>
Novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate downstream signalling pathways, were developed by Yan&#8208;Mei Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407037). piSTINGs could serve as novel STING agonists for vaccines and combination therapies. STING oligomerization is a useful strategy for the development of a new generation of STING agonists.

Droplets dancing to non&#8208;classical tunes: Nishant Singh and co&#8208;workers (e202406220) show how phase&#8208;separated amino acid droplets can non&#8208;classically evolve into poly&#8208;crystals and fibrous hydrogels. Several complex and direct pathways are explored to achieve transient or stable soft materials, single&#8208; or poly&#8208;crystals by provoking disordered droplets.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules deposited on polycrystalline cobalt are strongly hybridised with the inorganic surface and experience charge transfer from the cobalt. This is reflected in the modification of the interface electronic structure inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. In their Research Article (e202403495) M. Benedetta Casu et&#8197;al. report a method, based on X&#8208;ray spectroscopies, that helps to screen in a simple way organic/ferromagnetic interfaces for applications in spintronics.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Amorphous FeSnOx Nanosheets with Hierarchical Vacancies for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amorphous FeSnOx nanosheet with hierarchical defects, including abundant oxygen vacancies and nano&#8208;sized perforations, that can be assembled into a multifunctional layer overlaying commercial separators for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries was developed on the Research Article (e202404816) by Junyu Hou, Binbin Jia, Guangmin Zhou,, Jie Zhao et&#8197;al. The oxygen vacancies offer strong adsorption and abundant catalytic sites for polysulfides, while the nano&#8208;sized perforations facilitate the regulation of Na&#8208;ion transport. The task&#8208;specific layer achieves ultra&#8208;light, ultra&#8208;thin, and ultra&#8208;robust properties, and boosts the electrochemical performance of sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezo&#8208;catalysis Mechanism Elucidation by Tracking Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide with In&#8208;situ EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory of photocatalysis or the screening charge effect of electrochemical catalysis. Due to the formation of different intermediate active&#8208;species during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and piezo&#8208;catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB&#8208;OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo&#8208;catalysis over BOB&#8208;OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo&#8208;catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo&#8208;catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo&#8208;catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on&#160;Different CeO2&#160;Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5% and 97.6%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4 &#181;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetracationic Cobalt 3,4&#8208;pyridinoporphyrazine for Direct CO2 to Methanol Conversion Escaping the CO Intermediate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donnors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>MOFite: A High&#8208;Density Lithiophilic and Scalable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Anode for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an anode material that has better performance efficiency than commercial graphite while keeping the features of economic scalability and environmental safety is highly desirable yet challenging. MOFs are a promising addition to the ongoing efforts, however, the relatively poor performance, chemical instability, and large&#8208;scale economic production of efficiency&#8208;proven pristine MOFs restrict their utility in real&#8208;life energy storage applications. Furthermore, hierarchical porosity for lucid mass diffusion, high&#8208;density lithiophilic sites are some of the structural parameters for improving the electrode performance. Herein, we have demonstrated the potential of economically scalable salicylaldehydate 3D&#8208;conjugated&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8208;Tp) as a high&#8208;performance anode in Li&#8208;ion batteries: the anode&#8208;specific capacity achieved up to 1447 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and 89% of cyclic stability after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1.for pristine MOF. More importantly, incorporating 10% Fe&#8208;Tp doping in commercial graphite (MOFite) significantly enhanced lithium storage, doubling capacitance after 400 cycles. It signifies the potential practical utility of Fe&#8208;Tp as a performance booster for commercial anode material.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium&#8208;based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes for High&#8208;performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries with Eutectic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium&#8208;based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in&#8208;situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple&#8208;redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+ and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200 mA h g&#8208;1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal&#8208;based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of the V&#8208;PBA cathode, a high concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte (4.5 M ZnSO4 + 3 M Zn(OTf)2), and a water&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte (5.55 M glucose + 3 M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromative Dephosphinidenation of a Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene toward E&#8208;H (E = H, Si, N and P) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (5) was prepared by treatment of a sterically encumbered amino phosphorus dichloride (3) with MgA&#8226;3THF (A = anthracene). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a pentacyclic framework consisting of 5 with two phosphirane rings fused to the anthracene in a trans&#8208;fashion. Compound 5 has been shown to be an efficient phosphinidene synthon, readily liberating two transient phosphinidene units for subsequent downstream bond activation via the reductive elimination of anthracene under mild conditions. The formal oxidative addition of H2 and E&#8208;H (E = Si, N, P) bonds by the liberated phosphinidene provided diphosphine and substituted phosphines. Furthermore, phosphinidene transfer to alkenes and alkynes smoothly yielded the corresponding phosphiranes and phosphirenes. The mechanism of the H2 activation by 5 was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonds Based Reprogrammable and Re&#8208;processable Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Elastomer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent bonds endow liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with network rearrangeability, facilitating the fixation of mesogen alignment induced by external forces and enabling reversible actuation. In comparison, the bond exchange of supramolecular interactions is typically too significant to stably maintain the programmed alignment, particularly under intensified external stimuli. Nevertheless, the remaking and recycling of supramolecular interaction&#8208;based polymer networks are more accessible than those based on dynamic covalent bonds, as the latter are difficult to completely dissociate. Thus, preparing an LCE that possesses both supramolecular&#8208;like exchangeability and covalent bond&#8208;level stability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we addressed this issue by employing metal&#8208;ligand bonds as the crosslinking points of LCE networks. As such, mesogen alignment can be repeatedly encoded through metal&#8208;ligand bond exchange and stably maintained after programming, since the bond exchange rate is sufficiently slow when the programming and actuation temperatures are below the bond dissociation temperature. More importantly, the metal&#8208;ligand bonds can be completely dissociated at high temperatures, allowing the LCE network to be dissolved in a solvent and reshaped into desired geometries via solution casting. Building on these properties, our LCEs can be fabricated into versatile actuators, such as reversible folding origami, artificial muscles, and soft robotics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the asymmetric total syntheses of two rearranged tigliane diterpenoids, euphordraculoate A and pedrolide. A reductive dihydroxylation cascade and Nazarov cyclization were performed to generate euphordraculoate A, which was subjected to a cascade of Eu&#8208;promoted dienyl enolization, intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and enol&#8208;ketone tautomerization to afford pedrolide, a pathway consistent with our proposal for the biogenesis of pedrolide</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Organic Solar Cells to Over 18% Efficiency through Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Fluorinated Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study successfully designed and synthesized two nonfused ring electron acceptors, 412&#8208;6F and 412&#8208;6Cl, modified with fluorine and chlorine substituents, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that 412&#8208;6F possesses a planar molecular backbone and exhibits pronounced dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between the fluorine atoms on the lateral phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen atoms on the end groups. This specific interaction promotes dense end&#8208;group stacking, leading to a reduced interlayer spacing. Improved crystallinity and coherence length are observed in the D18:412&#8208;6F blend film. Conversely, 412&#8208;6Cl adopts a more distorted configuration and lacks these interactions. As a result, the organic solar cell (OSC) based on D18:412&#8208;6F achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 18.03%, surpassing the performance of the D18:412&#8208;6Cl OSC. This underscores the importance of designing novel acceptors with beneficial intermolecular interactions to enhance OSC efficiency, thus providing a new direction for organic photovoltaic advancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Material and Chemical Recycling of Waste PET/PE Multi&#8208;layer Films under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;layer plastic films are widely used in various fields especially for packaging, but due to complex composition, it is very difficult to recover single&#8208;material polymers or high&#8208;purity monomers from them after usage. In this study, we proposed a hydrothermal process for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) films. PET can be hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Using a hydrothermal system equipped with two filters, PE, TPA, and EG were collected separately, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films was firstly achieved. At 300 &#176;C and 10 MPa for 60 min, PET conversion reached around 100%, and TPA yield of 83.0% was obtained with a high TPA purity of 96.1%. In addition, the effect of the holding time on PET conversion, TPA yield, EG yield, and TPA purity was studied. This research opened up a new and sustainable pathway to recycle multi&#8208;layer plastic films in both lab and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8211;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ladder&#8208;Type Redox&#8208;Active Polymer Achieves Ultra&#8208;stable and Fast Proton Storage in Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Affordable and safe aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with unique &#8220;Grotthuss mechanism,&#8221; are very significant for advancing carbon neutrality initiatives. While organic polymers offer a robust and adaptable framework that is well&#8208;suited for APB electrodes, the limited proton&#8208;storage redox capacity has constrained their broader application. Herein, a ladder&#8208;type polymer (PNMZ) has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy that exhibits optimized electronic structure and fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport within the high&#8208;aromaticity polymeric skeleton. As a result, the polymer exhibits exceptional proton&#8208;storage redox kinetics, which are evidenced by in&#8208;operando monitoring techniques and theoretical calculations. It achieves a remarkable proton&#8208;storage capacity of 189 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1 and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, with approximately 97.8% capacity retention over 10,000 cycles. Finally, a high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer APB device has been successfully constructed with a desirable capacity retention of 99.7% after 6,000 cycles and high energy density of 56.3 Wh kg&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;gradient Concentration Distribution in Sb&#8208;Cu Alloy Nanoarrays for Robust Sodium&#8208;ionStorage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloy&#8208;type materials are attractive for anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and overall performance. However, the accumulation of stress/strain during repeated cycling results in electrode pulverization, leading to rapid capacity decay and eventual disintegration, thus hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a 3D coral&#8208;like Sb&#8208;Cu alloy nanoarray with gradient distribution of both elements. The array features a Sb&#8208;rich bottom and a Cu&#8208;rich top with increasing Sb and decreasing Cu concentrations from top to bottom. The former is the active component that provides the high capacity, whereas the latter serves as an inert additive that acts against volume variation. The gradual transition in composition within the electrode introduces a ladder&#8208;type volume expansion effect, facilitating a smooth distribution and effective release of stress, thereby ensuring the wanted mechanical stability and structural integrity. The as&#8208;developed nanoarray affords a high reversible capacity (460 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C), stable cycling (89% retention over 120 cycles at 1.0 C), and superior rate capability (354 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C). The concentration dual&#8208;gradient strategy paves a new pathway of designing alloy&#8208;type materials for SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surficial Homogenic Effect Enables Highly Stable Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The device performance of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep&#8208;blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition method to form homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs delivered an external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 5% (@ 460 nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The device performance of deep-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep-blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6-Tris(4-(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (P-POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet-dry deposition method to form homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep-blue PeLEDs delivered an external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 5% (@ 460 nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Template&#8208;Guided Synthesis of High&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies for Humidity Gradient&#8208;Based Power Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematically orchestrating  fundamental building blocks into intricate high&#8208;dimensional molecular assemblies at molecular level is imperative for multifunctionality integration. However, this remains a formidable task in crystal engineering due to the dynamic nature of inorganic building blocks. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;template&#8208;guided strategy to control building blocks. The coordination modes of ligands and the spatial hindrance of anionic templates are pivotal in dictating the overall structures. Flexible multi&#8208;dentate linkers selectively promote the formation of oligomeric assembly ([TeO3(Mo2O2S2)3O2(OH)(C5O2H7)3]4&#8208; {TeMo6}) into tetrahedral cages ([(TeO3)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O4P)6]8&#8208; {Te4Mo24} and [(AsO4)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O6)4]12&#8208; {As4Mo24}), while steric hindrance from anionic templates further assists in assembling cages into an open quadruply twisted M&#246;bius nanobelt ([(C6H5O3P)8(Mo2O2S2)24(OH)24(C8H10O4)12]16&#8208; {P8Mo48}). Among these structures, the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic hybrid cage {Te4Mo24} emerges as an exemplary molecular model for proton conduction and serves as a prototype for humidity gradient&#8208;based power generators (HGPGs). The Te4Mo24&#8208;PVDF&#8208;based HGPG (PVDF = Poly(vinylidene fluoride)) exhibits notable stability and power generation, yielding an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.51 V and a current density of 77.8 nA cm&#8208;2 at room temperature and 90% relative humidity (RH). Further insights into the interactions between water molecules and microscale molecules within the generator are achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. This endeavor unveils a universal strategy for synthesizing multifunctional integration molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in&#8208;situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25 V to afford 100 mA cm&#8208;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1 A cm&#8208;2 for 100 h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles with Low Immunogenicity and Its Application in the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the most advanced non&#8208;viral delivery system, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were approved by the FDA, propelling the advancements of gene therapy. However, their clinical applications are hampered by the potential immunogenicity of the lipid components that trigger immune&#8208;related adverse events, like inflammation and allergy. Herein, we formulate various dLNPs with diminished immunogenicity by incorporating dexamethasone (Dex) into liver&#8208;, spleen&#8208;, and lung&#8208;targeting LNPs formulations that exhibit excellent abilities to target specific organs and deliver various types of RNA, such as mRNA and siRNA. In vivo investigations demonstrate unparalleled advantages in safety compared to conventional LNPs, showing promising potential in the development of RNA therapeutics. Intriguingly, the encapsulation of runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 siRNA (siRUNX1) into lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs (dLNPs@siRUNX1) demonstrates remarkable advantages in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis through the synergy of gene therapy and drug therapy. This research establishes secure and universal platforms for the precise delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, showcasing promising clinical applications in gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Effect of a Dimerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dendrimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with a high horizontal orientation are highly essential for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes; however, pivotal molecular design strategies to improve the horizontal orientation of solution processable TADF emitters are still scarce and challenging. Herein, a phenyl bridge is adopted to connect the double TADF units, and a dimerized TADF dendrimer, D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF, is successfully constructed. Compared to counterpart with single TADF unit, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule not only exhibits an improved horizontal dipole ratio (78%) due to the &#960;&#8208;delocalization&#8208;induced extended molecular conjugation, but also displays a faster reversed intersystem crossing rate constant (6.08&#215;106 s&#8208;1) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95% in neat film. Consequently, the non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed device with D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as the emitter, achieves an ultra&#8208;high maximum EQE of 32.6%, which remains at 26.6% under a luminance of 1000 cd/m2. Furthermore, using D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as a sensitizer, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibits a high maximum EQE of 30.7% at a luminance of 575 cd/m2 and a full width at half maximum of 36 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840 nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51 eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44 cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850 nm irradiation (5 mW cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12 mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8217;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8208;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8208;, X = &#919;, Cl or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Cascade for the Depolymerization of the Lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Motif to Non&#8208;phenolic Dealkylated Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic monomers obtained by selective depolymerization of the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif are typically phenolic and contain (oxygenated) alkyl substitutions. This work reveals the potential of a one&#8208;pot catalytic lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 depolymerization cascade strategy that yields a uniform set of methoxylated aromatics without alkyl side&#8208;chains. This cascade consists of selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy group, subsequent retro&#8208;aldol reaction cleaving the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; bond followed by in situ acceptorless decarbonylation of the formed aldehydes. This three&#8208;step cascade reaction, catalyzed by an iridium(I)&#8208;BINAP complex, resulted in 75% 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene from G&#8208;type lignin dimers alongside syngas (CO:H2 &#8776; 1.4:1). Applying this method to a synthetic G&#8208;type polymer, 11 wt% 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene was obtained. This versatile compound can be easily transformed into 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenol, a valuable precursor for pharmaceutical synthesis, through enzymatic catalytic approach. Moreover, the hydrodeoxygenation potential of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene offers a pathway to produce valuable cyclohexane or benzene derivatives, presenting enticing opportunities for sustainable chemical transformations without the necessity for phenolic mixture upgrading via dealkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8208;F distance (rMnF = 8.2&#177;0.2 &#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285 h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4 T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1 = 5.36 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1 at 298K, 20MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;cored Graphdiyne Nanosheets through Dehydrogenative Coupling on Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally&#8208;induced dehydrogenative coupling of polyphenylenes on metal surfaces is an important technique to synthesize &#120587;&#8208;conjugated carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. However, this protocol has rarely been utilized to fabricate structurally defined carbon nanosheets composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Here, we present the synthesis of butadiyne&#8208;linked hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) on Au(111) surfaces as core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes. The reaction started from hexa(4&#8208;ethylphenyl)benzene, which undergoes dehydrogenation toward hexa(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)benzene, followed by planarization to hexabenzocoronene, coupling between the vinyl groups, and further dehydrogenation. In addition to butadiyne linkages, benzene groups were also found as another type of linker. The reaction sequences were monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, which disclose the structures of intermediates and final products. In combination with density functional theory simulations, the key steps from ethyl substituents to butadiyne and benzene linkers were elucidated. This is a new on&#8208;surface synthesis of core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes with unprecedented electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing the Intermediates Adsorption by Manipulating the Second Coordination Shell of Ir Single Atoms for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise regulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with the desired local chemical environment is vital to elucidate the relationship between the SACs structure and the catalytic performance. The debate on the effect of the local coordination environment is quite complicated even for the SACs with the same composition and chemical nature, calling for increased attention on the regulation of second coordination shell. For oxide&#8208;supported SACs, it remains a significant challenge to precisely manipulate the second coordination shell of single atoms supported on oxides due to the structural robustness of oxides. Here, Ir single atoms are anchored on NiO supports via different bonding strategies, resulting in the diverse Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. Specifically, Ir1/NiO, Ir1&#8208;NiO, and Ir1@NiO SACs with increasing Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Ni coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized, respectively. We found that the activity of the three samples towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Ni coordination number, with Ir1&#8208;NiO showing the lowest overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Mechanism investigations indicate that the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Ni in Ir1&#8208;NiO creates the higher occupied Ir dz2 orbital, weakening the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates and thereby enhancing the OER activity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The precise regulation of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with the desired local chemical environment is vital to elucidate the relationship between the SACs structure and the catalytic performance. The debate on the effect of the local coordination environment is quite complicated even for the SACs with the same composition and chemical nature, calling for increased attention on the regulation of second coordination shell. For oxide-supported SACs, it remains a significant challenge to precisely manipulate the second coordination shell of single atoms supported on oxides due to the structural robustness of oxides. Here, Ir single atoms are anchored on NiO supports via different bonding strategies, resulting in the diverse Ir-O-Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. Specifically, Ir1/NiO, Ir1-NiO, and Ir1@NiO SACs with increasing Ir-O-Ni coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized, respectively. We found that the activity of the three samples towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibited a volcano-shaped relationship with the Ir-O-Ni coordination number, with Ir1-NiO showing the lowest overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Mechanism investigations indicate that the moderate coordination number of Ir-O-Ni in Ir1-NiO creates the higher occupied Ir dz2 orbital, weakening the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates and thereby enhancing the OER activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integration of Perylene Diimide into a Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene diimides (PDIs) have garnered considerable attention due to its immense potential in photocatalysis. However, manipulating the molecular packing within their aggregates and enhancing the efficiency of photogenerated carrier recombination remain significant challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the incorporation of a PDI unit into a covalent organic framework (COF), named PDI&#8208;PDA, by linking an ortho&#8208;substituted PDI with p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA) to control its intermolecular aggregation. The incorporation enables precise modulation of electron transfer dynamics, leading to a ten&#8208;fold increase in the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide with PDI&#8208;PDA compared to the PDI molecular counterpart, achieving yields exceeding 90%. Electron property studies and density functional theory calculations show that the PDI&#8208;PDA with its well&#8208;defined crystal structure, enhances &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and lowers the electron transition barrier. Moreover, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the PDI unit promotes the spatial separation of the valency band maximum and conduction band minimum of PDI&#8208;PDA suppressing the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and improving charge separation efficiency to give high photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a brief yet effective way for the improvement of the photocatalytic efficiency of commonly used PDI&#8208;based dyes by integrating them into a framework skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Bridging Induced Anti&#8208;salting&#8208;out Effect Enabling High Ionic Conductive ZnSO4&#8208;based Hydrogel for Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs) hold great promise in tackling severe issues emerging in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, but the prevalent salting&#8208;out effect of kosmotropic salt causes low ionic conductivity and electrochemical instability. Herein, a subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. By introducing urea containing both an H&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, the broken H&#8208;bonds between PVA and H2O, initiated by the SO42&#8208;&#8208;driven H2O polarization, could be re&#8208;united via intense intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus leading to greatly increased carrying capacity of ZnSO4. The urea&#8208;modified PVA&#8208;ZnSO4 HEs featuring a high ionic conductivity up to 31.2 mS cm&#8211;1 successfully solves the sluggish ionic transport dilemma at the solid&#8208;solid interface. Moreover, an organic solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase can be derived from the in&#8208;situ electro&#8208;polymerization of urea to prohibit H2O&#8208;involved side reactions, thereby prominently improving the reversibility of Zn chemistry. Consequently, Zn anodes witness an impressive lifespan extension from 50 h to 2200 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 while the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery maintains a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.7%) even after 8000 cycles. The anti&#8208;salting&#8208;out strategy proposed in this work provides an insightful concept for addressing the phase separation issue of functional HEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Ordering in A One&#8208;Dimensional Organic Copper Chloride Hybrid Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low dimensional (LD) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as new generation functional materials with exceptional structural and property tunability. Despite the remarkable advances in the development of LD OMHHs, optical properties have been the major functionality extensively investigated for most of LD OMHHs developed to date, while other properties, such as magnetic and electronic properties, remain significantly under&#8208;explored. Here we report for the first time the characterization of the magnetic and electronic properties of a 1D OMHH, organic&#8208;copper (II) chloride hybrid (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6. Owing to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu atoms through chloride bridges in 1D [Cu2Cl62&#8208;]&#8734; chains, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 is found to exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24K. The two&#8208;terminal (2T) electrical measurement on a (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 single crystal reveals its insulating nature. This work shows the potential of LD OMHHs as a highly tunable quantum material platform for spintronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Constructing Molecular Junctions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction&#8208;type porphyrin&#8208;based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP) was successfully self&#8208;assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (selectivity, ~100%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single&#8208;component photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure&#8208;function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Cage as an Efficient&#160;Platform for Industrial Radioactive Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we firstly develop porous organic cage (POC) as an efficient platform for highly effective radioactive iodine capture under industrial operating conditions (typically &#8805; 150 &#176;C, &#8804; 150 ppmv of I2). Due to the highly dispersed and readily accessible binding sites as well as sufficient accommodating space, the constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8208;)Me (NKPOC = Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake capacity of 48.35 wt% and extraordinary adsorption capacity of unit ionic site (~1.62) at 150 &#176;C and 150 ppmv of I2. The I2 capacity is 3.5, 1.6, and 1.3 times higher than industrial silver&#8208;based adsorbents Ag@MOR and benchmark materials of TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8208; under the same conditions. Furthermore, NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8208;)Me exhibits remarkable adsorption kinetics (k1 = 0.013 min&#8722;1), which is 1.2 and 1.6 times higher than TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8208; under the identical conditions. NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8208;)Me thus sets a new benchmark for industrial radioactive I2 adsorbents. This work not only provides a new insight for effectively enhancing the adsorption capacity of unit functional sites, but also advances POC as an efficient platform for radioiodine capture in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminoimines from 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Sulfinylimines by Using Allyl Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is realized, through rapid and exclusive mono&#8208;allylation of chiral bis&#8208;N&#8208;sulfinylimines using allylboronic acids. The highly selective allylation was possible as electrophilic imine functional group in the product &#945;&#8208;aminoimines remained unreactive towards allyl boronic acid nucleophiles. Notably, by varying the geometry and chiral auxiliary, all four isomers of the &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were accessed from readily available precursors. A range of allyl nucleophiles, which are tricky to generate by other means possessing highly reactive functional groups also took part in this reaction, expanding the scope further. The applicability of the products &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were further demonstrated by accessing a range of structurally diverse chiral cyclic and acyclic 1,2&#8208;diamines bearing adjacent stereocenters through addition of a second nucleophile or aza&#8208;Prins&#8208;type cyclization by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the tethered alkene moiety. Moreover, the leaving group aptitude of sulfinyl auxiliary attached to imine, was exploited to access valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles under thermal conditions without employing any reagents. Detailed DFT calculation revealed a chair&#8208;like transition state likely operating for the allylboration reaction across imine.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of simplified synthetic strategy to create structurally and functionally diverse pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic molecules is highly appealing but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by natural scaffolds, herein, we describe a practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8210;H alkylation, olefination and arylation macrocyclization, which could offer a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. Interestingly, the potential of ligand acceleration in C&#8210;H activation is also demonstrated by an unprecedented enantioselective sp3 C&#8210;H alkylation macrocyclization. Moreover, a combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide 2a, which showed a promising efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of silent information regulator sirtuin 3 (SIRT3).</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Ion Covalent Organic Framework Electrolytes Enabled by Nitrile Migration Ladders for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor electrochemical stability window and low ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state electrolytes hinder the development of safe, high&#8208;voltage, and energy&#8208;dense lithium metal batteries. Herein, taking advantage of the unique electronic effect of nitrile groups, we designed a novel azanide&#8208;based single&#8208;ion covalent organic framework (CN&#8208;iCOF) structure that possesses effective Li+ transport and high&#8208;voltage stability in lithium metal batteries. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) revealed that electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups not only resulted in an ultralow HOMO energy orbital but also enhanced Li+ dissociation through charge delocalization, leading to a high tLi+ of 0.93 and remarkable oxidative stability up to 5.6 V (vs. Li+/Li) simultaneously. Moreover, cyanation leveraging Strecker reaction transformed reversible imine&#8208;linkage to a stable sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing azanide anion, which facilitated contorted alignment of transport &#8220;ladders&#8221; along the one&#8208;dimensional anionic channels and the ionic conductivity could reach 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 at ambient temperature without any additives. As a result, CN&#8208;iCOF allowed operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811), demonstrating stable lithium deposition up to 1,100 h and reversible battery cycling at ambient temperature up to 4.5 V, shedding light on the importance of discovering new functionality for forthcoming high&#8208;performance batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Environment and Distance Optimization of Dual Single Atoms on Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial anode reaction in the chlor&#8208;alkali industrial process. Precious metal&#8208;based dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) are commonly used as catalysts for CER but are constrained by their high cost and low selectivity. Herein, a Pt dual singe&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs) is designed for an efficient and robust CER process. The prepared Pt DSAC demonstrates excellent CER activity with a low overpotential of 21 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a remarkable mass activity of 3802.6 A gpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential around 30 mV, outperforming those of commercial DSA and Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts. The excellent CER performance of Pt DSAC is attributed to the high atomic utilization and improved intrinsic activity. Notably, introducing fluorine atoms on CNTs increases the oxidation and chlorination resistance of Pt DSAC, and reduces the demetalization ratio of Pt atoms, resulting in excellent long&#8208;term CER stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that several Pt DSAC configurations with optimized first&#8208;shell ligands and interatomic distance display lower energy barriers for Cl intermediates generation and weaker ionic Pt&#8208;Cl bond interaction, which are favorable for the CER process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8210;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8210;H thianthrenation and C&#8210;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8210;S over C&#8210;I, C&#8210;Br, C&#8210;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8210;OTf), tosylates (C&#8210;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8210;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity.

         <title>Stable Meisenheimer Complexes as Powerful Photoreductants Readily Obtained from Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited states of radical anions derived from the photoreduction of stable organic molecules are suggested to serve as potent reductants. However, excited states of these species are too short&#8208;lived to allow bimolecular quenching processes. Recently, the singlet excited state of Meisenheimer complexes, which possess a long&#8208;lived excited state, was identified as the competent species for the reduction of challenging organic substrates (&#8211;2.63 V vs. SCE, saturated calomel electrode). To produce reasonably stable and simply accessible different Meisenheimer complexes, the addition of nBuLi to readily available aromatic heterocycles was investigated, and the photoreactivity of the generated species was studied. In this paper, we present the straightforward preparation of a family of powerful photoreductants (*Eox&lt;&#8211;3 V vs. SCE in their excited states, determined by DFT and time&#8208;dependent TD&#8208;DFT calculations; (DFT, density functional theory) that can induce dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides and to form C&#8722;C bond through radical cyclization. Photophysical analyses and computational studies in combination with experimental mechanistic investigations demonstrate the ability of the adduct to act as a strong electron donor under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Paramagnetic Nickel&#8211;Zinc Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of a molecular zinc&#8211;hydride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}ZnH] (Ar = 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) with 0.5 equiv. of [Ni(CO)Cp]2 led to the isolation of a nickel&#8211;zinc hydride complex containing a bridging 3&#8208;centre,2&#8208;electron Ni&#8211;H&#8211;Zn interaction. This species has been characterized in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations are consistent with its formulation as a &#963;&#8208;complex derived from coordination of the zinc&#8211;hydride to a paramagnetic nickel(I) fragment. Continuous wave and pulse EPR experiments suggest that this species is not stable in solution and suggest that this species is labile in solution. Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D&#8208;exchange with D2 or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8211;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth media. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fate of the Formic Acid Proton on the Anatase TiO2(101) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a prototype adsorption reaction of gas Br&#248;nsted acid on oxides, we study the adsorption of formic acid on anatase. We perform infrared spectroscopy measurements of adsorbed HCOOH and HCOOD on TiO2 nanopowders, from 13 K up to room temperature in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum chamber. We assign the IR signals via computed spectra from nuclear quantum dynamics simulations using our divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics method. The acid proton forms an extraordinarily short and strong hydrogen bond with the surface oxygen. The strength of this hydrogen bond, that compares to H bonds in ice at high pressures, is at the root of a substantial redshift with respect to the typical free OH stretching frequency, which eludes its straightforward detection.</dc:description>

A series of bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium(III) connected by naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) and perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) units have been prepared to determine the nature and strength of the (Cl)lone&#8208;pair&#8208;&#960; interactions between the chloride ligands and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties. Analysis of this interaction revealed that its enthalpy lies in the 6&#8211;9&#8197;kcal/mol range.







Abstract
A series of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) and perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) connected bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium(III) have been prepared and fully characterized. The analysis of their NMR spectroscopic features, together with their molecular structures show that these species display lone&#8208;pair&#8208;&#960; interactions between the chloride ligands of the Ir(III) complex and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties. The detection of this type of interaction in solution is due to the formation of two atropisomers, which are formed as a result of the restricted rotation about the Ir&#8722;Ccarbene bond imposed by the (Cl)lp&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR analysis allowed the determination of the strength of this non&#8208;covalent interaction, which lies between &#916;H=6.6 and 10&#8197;kcal/mol. The computational studies performed fully support the experimental findings.

         <title>[2.2]Benzoindenophane&#8208;Based Chiral Indenyl Ligands: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both the development of optically pure chiral indenyl rhodium(IndxRh) catalysts and IndxRh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation are challenging and seldom reported. Herein, a class of chiral indenyl ligands bearing a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton is presented. It is convenient to synthesize and easy to modify (13 variations are shown). Importantly, its coordination to rhodium is face&#8208;specific. Moreover, the utilities of its IndxRh catalysts have been demonstrated by two asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
Development of chiral indenyl ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation is a longstanding challenge, and extremely few successes have been achieved. In this paper, we describe a class of readily accessible, facilely tunable and user&#8208;friendly chiral indenyl ligands featuring a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton via a divergent synthesis strategy. The corresponding chiral indenyl rhodium catalysts were successfully applied in the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of O&#8208;Boc hydroxybenzamide with alkenes to give various chiral dihydroisoquinolone products (up to 97&#8201;% yield, up to 98&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of carboxylic acids with alkynes was also successfully accomplished, providing a range of axially chiral isocoumarins (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 94&#8201;% ee). Notably, this represents the first example of enantioselective transition metal catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation/oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with internal alkynes to construct isocoumarins. Given many attractive features of this class of indenyl ligands, such as convenient synthesis, high tunability and exclusive face&#8208;selectivity of coordination, its applications in more catalytic asymmetric C&#8722;H activation and in other asymmetric catalysis are foreseen.

Wang, Torres et&#8197;al. describe a probe for the live cell monitoring of nutrient uptake by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. By dually quenching a CFSE&#8208;probe that becomes fluorogenic after treatment with cytosolic esterases, and fluorescent upon reaction with strained alkenes, they could monitor uptake of fatty acids, sugars, and amino acids in primary immune cells.







Abstract
Cells rely heavily on the uptake of exogenous nutrients for survival, growth, and differentiation. Yet quantifying the uptake of small molecule nutrients at the single cell level is difficult. Here we present a new approach to studying the nutrient uptake in live single cells using Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels Alder (IEDDA) chemistry. We have modified carboxyfluorescein&#8208;diacetate&#8208;succinimidyl esters (CFSE)&#8212;a quenched fluorophore that can covalently react with proteins and is only turned on in the cytosol of a cell following esterase activity&#8212;with a tetrazine. This tetrazine serves as a second quencher for the pendant fluorophore. Upon reaction with nutrients modified with an electron&#8208;rich or strained dienophile in an IEDDA reaction, this quenching group is destroyed, thereby enabling the probe to fluoresce. This has allowed us to monitor the uptake of a variety of dienophile&#8208;containing nutrients in live primary immune cell populations using flow cytometry and live&#8208;cell microscopy.

         <title>Aqueous Developable and CO2&#8208;Sourced Chemical Amplification Photoresist with High Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a set of CO2&#8208;sourced polycarbonates containing acid&#8208;labile cyclic acetal structures were explored as chemical amplification photoresist in deep ultraviolet lithography, and these materials exhibit a superior lithography performance than commercial KrF and ArF resists, demonstrating a promising application prospect in integrated circuit manufacture.







Abstract
Seeking high&#8208;performance photoresists is an important item for semiconductor industry due to the continuous miniaturization and intelligentization of integrated circuits. Polymer resin containing carbonate group has many desirable properties, such as high transmittance, acid sensitivity and chemical formulation, thus serving as promising photoresist material. In this work, a series of aqueous developable CO2&#8208;sourced polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs) were produced via alternating copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides bearing acid&#8208;cleavable cyclic acetal groups in the presence of tetranuclear organoborane catalyst. The produced CO2&#8208;PCs were investigated as chemical amplification resists in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Under the catalysis of photogenerated acid, the acetal (ketal) groups in CO2&#8208;PC were hydrolysed into two equivalents of hydroxyl groups, which change the exposed area from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity, thus enabling the exposed area to be developed with water. Through normalized remaining thickness analysis, the optimal CO2&#8208;derived resist achieved a remarkable sensitivity of 1.9&#8197;mJ/cm2, a contrast of 7.9, a favorable resolution (750&#8197;nm, half pitch), and a good etch resistance (38&#8201;% higher than poly(tert&#8208;butyl acrylate)). Such performances outperform commercial KrF and ArF chemical amplification resists (i.e., polyhydroxystyrene&#8208;derived and polymethacrylate&#8208;based resists), which endows broad application prospects in the field of DUV (KrF and ArF) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for nanomanufacturing.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Based Multimeric Aptamer Generation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization for Electrochemical Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface&#8208;based room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) method for multimeric aptamer generation alongside relevant surface bio&#8208;functionalization were employed on nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) working electrodes (WEs) for developing highly sensitive and selective NMIs multimeric aptasensors.







Abstract
Multimeric aptamers have gained more attention than their monomeric counterparts due to providing more binding sites for target analytes, leading to increased affinity. This work attempted to engineer the surface&#8208;based generation of multimeric aptamers by employing the room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique and chemically modified primers for developing a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor. The multimeric aptamers, generated through surface RCA, are hybridized to modified spacer primers, facilitating the positioning of the aptamers in the proximity of sensing surfaces. These multimeric aptamers can be used as bio&#8208;receptors for capturing specific targets. The surface amplification process was fully characterized, and the optimal amplification time for biosensing purposes was determined, using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SP). Interestingly, multimeric aptasensors produced considerably higher response signals and affinity (more than 10&#8208;fold), as well as higher sensitivity (almost 4&#8208;fold) compared to monomeric aptasensors. Furthermore, the impact of surface structures on the response signals was studied by utilizing both flat working electrodes (WEs) and nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) WEs. The NMIs multimeric aptasensors showed significantly higher sensitivity in buffer and saliva media with the limit of detection less than 2&#8197;fg/ml. Finally, the developed NMIs multimeric aptasensors were clinically challenged with several saliva patient samples.

         <title>Efficient Neutral H2O2 Electrosynthesis from Favorable Reaction Microenvironments via Porous Carbon Carrier Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous carbon sphere carriers were optimized to enhance O2 enrichment and localized pH elevation, establishing a favorable microenvironment for 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media to generate H2O2 with an exceptional production rate of 15.77&#8197;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, yielding a neutral H2O2 solution suitable for medical disinfection.







Abstract
The efficient electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in neutral media is undoubtedly a practical route, but the limited comprehension of electrocatalysts has hindered the system advancement. Herein, we present the design of model catalysts comprising mesoporous carbon spheres&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for H2O2 electrosynthesis at near&#8208;zero overpotential with approximately 95&#8201;% selectivity in a neutral electrolyte. Impressively, the optimized Pd/MCS&#8208;8 electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 15.77&#8197;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, generating a neutral H2O2 solution with an accumulated concentration of 6.43&#8197;wt&#8201;%, a level sufficiently high for medical disinfection. Finite element simulation and experimental results suggest that mesoporous carbon carriers promote O2 enrichment and localized pH elevation, establishing a favorable microenvironment for 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the robust interaction between Pd nanoparticles and the carbon carriers optimized the adsorption of OOH* at the carbon edge, ensuring high active 2e&#8722; process. These findings offer new insights into carbon&#8208;loaded electrocatalysts for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media, emphasizing the role of carrier engineering in constructing favorable microenvironments and synergizing active sites.

         <title>Size Control of Chiral Nanospheres Obtained via Nanoprecipitation of Helical Poly(phenylacetylene)s in the Absence of Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable chiral nanospheres with controlled size and density can be obtained from nanoprecipitation of helical poly(phenylacetylenes). These polymer nanoparticles are stable in water in the absence of surfactants and have the ability of encapsulating metal nanoparticles or fluorescent dyes which can be further released by light irradiation.







Abstract
Nanostructuration of dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) depends on the secondary structure adopted by the polymer and the functional group used to connect the chiral pendant to the PPA backbone. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic and flexible scaffolds (para&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&lt;165&#176;) generate by nanoprecipitation low polydisperse nanospheres with controllable size at different acetone/water mixtures, those with a quasi&#8208;static behavior and the presence of an extended, almost planar structure (ortho&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&gt;165&#176;), aggregate into a mixture of spherical and oval nanostructures whose size is not controlled. Photostability studies show that poly(phenylacetylene) particles are more stable to light irradiation than when dissolved macromolecularly. Moreover, the photostability of the particle depends on the secondary structure of the PPA and its screw sense excess. This fact, in combination with the encapsulation ability of these polymer particles, allows the creation of light stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers, whose cargo can be delivered by light irradiation.

&lt;p&gt;Stable chiral nanospheres with controlled size and density can be obtained from nanoprecipitation of helical poly(phenylacetylenes). These polymer nanoparticles are stable in water in the absence of surfactants and have the ability of encapsulating metal nanoparticles or fluorescent dyes which can be further released by light irradiation.

         <title>Unlocking Single Particle Anisotropy in Real&#8208;Time for Photoelectrochemistry Processes at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time tracking and investigation of single particle anisotropy in the dynamic photochemistry processes at the nanoscale via collision electrochemistry is performed. This high&#8208;throughput material screening methodology offers insights into the impact of morphological anisotropy on interfacial mass transfer and electron transfer kinetics in plasmonic&#8208;assisted electrochemistry.







Abstract
The key to rationally and rapidly designing high&#8208;performance materials is the monitoring and comprehension of dynamic processes within individual particles in real&#8208;time, particularly to gain insight into the anisotropy of nanoparticles. The intrinsic property of nanoparticles typically varies from one crystal facet to the next under realistic working conditions. Here, we introduce the operando collision electrochemistry to resolve the single silver nanoprisms (Ag NPs) anisotropy in photoelectrochemistry. We directly identify the effect of anisotropy on the plasmonic&#8208;assisted electrochemistry at the single NP/electrolyte interface. The statistical collision frequency shows that heterogeneous diffusion coefficients among crystal facets facilitate Ag NPs to undergo direction&#8208;dependent mass transfer toward the gold ultramicroelectrode. Subsequently, the current amplitudes of transient events indicate that the anisotropy enables variations in dynamic interfacial electron transfer behaviors during photothermal processes. The results presented here demonstrate that the measurement precision of collision electrochemistry can be extended to the sub&#8208;nanoparticle level, highlighting the potential for high&#8208;throughput material screening with comprehensive kinetics information at the nanoscale.

         <title>Neighbouring Synergy in High&#8208;Density Single Ir Atoms on CoGaOOH for Efficient Alkaline Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts was strictly limited by isolated single&#8208;atom sites. Fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to realize the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms exhibited great potential to break performance limitations. Herein, we revealed that the synergetic interaction in neighbouring Ir single atoms contributes to enhanced performance for oxygen evolution relative to isolated Ir single atoms.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts was strictly limited by isolated single&#8208;atom sites. Fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to realize the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could optimize the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates, which exhibited great potential to break performance limitations and deepen mechanistic understanding of electrocatalysis. However, the catalytic behavior governed by neighbouring single atoms is particularly elusive and has yet to be understood. Herein, we revealed that the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms contributes to superior performance for oxygen evolution relative to isolated Ir single atoms. Neighbouring single atoms was achieved by fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to narrow the distance between single atoms. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the Nei&#8208;Ir1/CoGaOOH with neighbouring Ir single atoms exhibited a low overpotential of 170&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;durable stability over 2000&#8197;h for oxygen evolution. Mechanistic studies revealed that neighbouring single atoms synergetic stabilized the *OOH intermediates via extra hydrogen bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers, as compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could offer guidance for the development of efficient electrocatalysts, thus accelerating the world&#8216;s transition to sustainable energy.

         <title>Divalent Titanium via Reductive N&#8722;C Coupling of a TiIV Nitrido with &#960;&#8208;Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A titanium nitride undergoes N&#8722;C bond coupling with carbon monoxide and isocyanides to form TiII cumulene complexes [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]&#8722; (E=O, NAd, NtBu). Oxidation of these affords the TiIII cumulene [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]. Further oxidation affords a TiIV bis&#8208;cumulene trans&#8208;[(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2]. Structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic studies (HFEPR, CW X&#8208;band, NMR and IR spectroscopies), including 15N isotopic labelling studies are presented and discussed to understand the bonding and topology.







Abstract
The nitrido&#8208;ate complex [(PN)2Ti(N){&#956;2&#8208;K(OEt2)}]2 (1) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reductively couples CO and isocyanides in the presence of DME or cryptand (Kryptofix222), to form rare, five&#8208;coordinate TiII complexes having a linear cumulene motif, [K(L)][(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, L=Kryptofix222, (2); E=NAd, L=3 DME, (3); E=NtBu, L=3 DME, (4); E=NAd, L=Kryptofix222, (5)). Oxidation of 2&#8211;5 with [Fc][OTf] afforded an isostructural TiIII center containing a neutral cumulene, [(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, (6); E=NAd (7), NtBu (8)) and characterization by CW X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy, revealed unpaired electron to be metal centric. Moreover, 1e&#8722; reduction of 6 and 7 in the presence of Kryptofix222cleanly reformed corresponding discrete TiII complexes 2 and 5, which were further characterized by solution magnetization measurements and high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, oxidation of 7 with [Fc*][B(C6F5)4] resulted in a ligand disproportionated TiIV complex having transoid carbodiimides, [(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2] (9). Comparison of spectroscopic, structural, and computational data for the divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent systems, including their 15N enriched isotopomers demonstrate these cumulenes to decrease in order of backbonding as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV and increasing order of &#960;&#8208;donation as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV, thus displaying more covalency in TiIII species. Lastly, we show a synthetic cycle whereby complex 1 can deliver an N&#8208;atom to CO and CNAd.

         <title>Synthesis of Photoresponsive Fast Self&#8208;healing Polyolefin Composites by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Copolymerization of Ethylene and Lignin Cluster Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lignin cluster polymerization strategy (LCPS) prevents the poisoning of the &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalyst by polarmonomers or polar groups of lignin, and achieves efficient synthesis of polyolefin composites. This strategy enabled even dispersion of lignin, enhancing photothermal conversion and interfacial heat transfer between lignin and polymers, thereby accelerating self&#8208;healing speed.







Abstract
Polymers may suffer from sudden mechanical damages during long&#8208;term use under various harsh operating environments. Rapid and real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing will extend their service life, which is particularly attractive in the context of circular economy. In this work, a lignin cluster polymerization strategy (LCPS) was designed to prepare a series of lignin functionalized polyolefin composites with excellent mechanical properties through nickel catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene and lignin cluster monomers. These composites can achieve rapid self&#8208;healing within 30&#8197;seconds under a variety of extreme usage environments (underwater, seawater, extremely low temperatures as low as &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, organic solvents, acid/alkali solvents, etc.), which is of great significance for real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing of sudden mechanical damage. More importantly, the dynamic cross&#8208;linking network within these composites enable great re&#8208;processability and amazing sealing performances.

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Tafbromin Selectively Targets the TAF1 Bromodomain 2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinolone pseudo&#8208;natural product Tafbromin was identified as an inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling&#8208;induced osteogenesis. Tafbromin binds to the second bromodomain of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1) with high selectivity over other bromodomains and suppresses the expression of Hedgehog target genes and alkaline phosphatase.







Abstract
Phenotypic assays detect small&#8208;molecule bioactivity at functionally relevant cellular sites, and inherently cover a variety of targets and mechanisms of action. They can uncover new small molecule&#8208;target pairs and may give rise to novel biological insights. By means of an osteoblast differentiation assay which employs a Hedgehog (Hh) signaling agonist as stimulus and which monitors an endogenous marker for osteoblasts, we identified a pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoline (PQ) pseudo&#8208;natural product (PNP) class of osteogenesis inhibitors. The most potent PQ, termed Tafbromin, impairs canonical Hh signaling and modulates osteoblast differentiation through binding to the bromodomain 2 of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1). Tafbromin is the most selective TAF1 bromodomain 2 ligand and promises to be an invaluable tool for the study of biological processes mediated by TAF1(2) bromodomains.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Bond Crosslinking Strategy Enabling Resilient and Recyclable Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy is proposed for solid polymer electrolytes to decouple their trade&#8208;off relationships among mechanical, recyclable and conductive properties. The elastically resilient, chemically recyclable and highly conductive solid polymer electrolyte enables 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;class and room&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries with stable cyclability, high rate&#8208;capability and recyclability.







Abstract
Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface issues of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade&#8208;offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+&#8208;dissociation co&#8208;polymer chains, where the &#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208; bond maintains the load&#8208;bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non&#8208;spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading&#8208;unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (25&#8201;&#176;C) and chemical recyclability. Then, exceptional room&#8208;temperature performances are obtained for repeated Li plating/stripping tests, and stable cycling of LMBs with either LiFePO4 or 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;class LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 cathode. Furthermore, the recycled and reprocessed SPEs can be circularly reused in LMBs without significant performance degradation. Our findings provide an inspiring design principle for SPEs to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface and sustainability challenges of solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Creating High&#8208;entropy Single Atoms on Transition Disulfides through Substrate&#8208;induced Redox Dynamics for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

In this work, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt during the HER.







Abstract
The controllable anchoring of multiple metal single&#8208;atoms (SAs) into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities, while marrying the concentration&#8208;complex multimetallic SAs and high&#8208;entropy SAs (HESAs) into one SAC system remains a substantial challenge. Here, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports, which can precisely control the doping location of SAs. Specially, the contents of SAs can continuously increase until the accessible Mo atoms on TMDs carriers are completely replaced by SAs, thus allowing the of much higher metal contents. In&#8208;depth mechanistic study shows that the well&#8208;controlled synthesis of multimetallic SAs and HESAs is realized by controlling the reversible redox reaction occurred on the TMDs/TM ion interface. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a variety of SAs&#8208;TMDs were applied to hydrogen evolution reaction. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt. Thus, our work will broaden the family of single&#8208;atom catalysts and provide a new guideline for the rational design of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Phosphonoalamides Reveal the Biosynthetic Origin of Phosphonoalanine Natural Products and a Convergent Pathway for Their Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptomyces phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of phosphonoalanine (PnAla) biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. The transamination of phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) to PnAla drives unfavorable C&#8722;P bond formation despite its reversibility, establishing this early branch of phosphonate biosynthesis, while the promiscuity of the dipeptide and tripeptide ligases result in a dramatic expansion of observed di&#8208; and tripeptide products.







Abstract
Phosphonate natural products, with their potent inhibitory activity, have found widespread use across multiple industries. Their success has inspired development of genome mining approaches that continue to reveal previously unknown bioactive scaffolds and biosynthetic insights. However, a greater understanding of phosphonate metabolism is required to enable prediction of compounds and their bioactivities from sequence information alone. Here, we expand our knowledge of this natural product class by reporting the complete biosynthesis of the phosphonoalamides, antimicrobial tripeptides with a conserved N&#8208;terminal l&#8208;phosphonoalanine (PnAla) residue produced by Streptomyces. The phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of PnAla biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. We elucidate the biochemistry underlying the transamination of phosphonopyruvate to PnAla, a new early branchpoint in phosphonate biosynthesis catalyzed by an aminotransferase with evolved specificity for phosphonate metabolism. Peptide formation is catalyzed by two ATP&#8208;grasp ligases, the first of which produces dipeptides, and a second which ligates dipeptides to PnAla to produce phosphonoalamides. Substrate specificity profiling revealed a dramatic expansion of dipeptide and tripeptide products, while finding PnaC to be the most promiscuous dipeptide ligase reported thus far. Our findings highlight previously unknown transformations in natural product biosynthesis, promising enzyme biocatalysts, and unveil insights into the diversity of phosphonopeptide natural products.

     alt="Phosphonoalamides Reveal the Biosynthetic Origin of Phosphonoalanine Natural Products and a Convergent Pathway for Their Diversification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of phosphonoalanine (PnAla) biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. The transamination of phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) to PnAla drives unfavorable C&#8722;P bond formation despite its reversibility, establishing this early branch of phosphonate biosynthesis, while the promiscuity of the dipeptide and tripeptide ligases result in a dramatic expansion of observed di- and tripeptide products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphonate natural products, with their potent inhibitory activity, have found widespread use across multiple industries. Their success has inspired development of genome mining approaches that continue to reveal previously unknown bioactive scaffolds and biosynthetic insights. However, a greater understanding of phosphonate metabolism is required to enable prediction of compounds and their bioactivities from sequence information alone. Here, we expand our knowledge of this natural product class by reporting the complete biosynthesis of the phosphonoalamides, antimicrobial tripeptides with a conserved &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-phosphonoalanine (PnAla) residue produced by &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt;. The phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of PnAla biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. We elucidate the biochemistry underlying the transamination of phosphonopyruvate to PnAla, a new early branchpoint in phosphonate biosynthesis catalyzed by an aminotransferase with evolved specificity for phosphonate metabolism. Peptide formation is catalyzed by two ATP-grasp ligases, the first of which produces dipeptides, and a second which ligates dipeptides to PnAla to produce phosphonoalamides. Substrate specificity profiling revealed a dramatic expansion of dipeptide and tripeptide products, while finding PnaC to be the most promiscuous dipeptide ligase reported thus far. Our findings highlight previously unknown transformations in natural product biosynthesis, promising enzyme biocatalysts, and unveil insights into the diversity of phosphonopeptide natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Light&#8208;Powered Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Molecular Motor with Colour&#8208;Selective Single&#8208;Step Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motors access small length scale and have potential for precision technology. But the top&#8208;down control of these motors is a challenge as they are molecular objects subject to stochastic fluctuations. Now a rationally designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor demonstrates a novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism that pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down control of small motion is possible through top&#8208;down controlled molecular motors in replacement of larger actuators like MEMS or NEMS (micro&#8208; or nano&#8208;electromechanical systems) in the current precision technology. Improving top&#8208;down control of molecular motors to every single step is desirable for this purpose, and also for synchronization of motor actions for amplified effects. Here we report a designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor powered by alternated ultraviolet and visible light for processive track&#8208;walking, with the two light colours each locking the motor in a full directional step to allow saturated driving but no overstepping. This novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step, thus providing a key technical capability to advance the molecular motor&#8208;based precision technology and also motor synchronization for amplified effects.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Radical 1,2&#8208;Azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids is reported. This process is notable for using chiral copper&#8208;based complex as a bifunctional catalyst for photoinduced azidyl radical generation and C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling, providing access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved multicomponent difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has recently emerged as a promising strategy for rapid synthesis of valuable allylic compounds in one&#8208;pot operation. However, the expansion of radical scope and enantiocontrol remain two major challenges. Herein, we describe an unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids. This mild protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, providing practical access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters. Mechanistic studies imply that the chiral copper complex is implicated as a bifunctional catalyst in both the photoredox catalyzed azidyl radical generation and enantioselective radical C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Radical C&#8722;C Coupling from Carboxylic Acids with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual nickel/photoredox catalyzed selective radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed with readily available carboxylic acids and their NHPI ester derivatives as coupling partners. This synergistic catalysis enables the mild and efficient building of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds or C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, affording structurally complex ketones and congested products with all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.







Abstract
Controlling the cross&#8208;coupling reaction between two different radicals is a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the process occurring statistically, which would lead to three products, including two homocoupling products and one cross&#8208;coupling product. Generally, the cross&#8208;coupling selectivity is achieved by the persistent radical effect (PRE) that requires the presence of a persistent radical and a transient radical, thus resulting in limited radical precursors. In this paper, a highly selective cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl radicals with acyl radicals to construct C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, or with alkyl radicals to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds have been achieved with the readily available carboxylic acids and their derivatives (NHPI ester) as coupling partners. The success originates from the use of tridentate ligand (2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) to enable radical cross&#8208;coupling process to Ni&#8208;mediated organometallic mechanism. This protocol offers a facile and flexible access to structurally diverse ketones (up to 90&#8201;% yield), and also a new solution for the challenging double decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling. The broad utility and functional group tolerance are further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural&#8208;occurring carboxylic acids and drugs.

         <title>Aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;Diazadiborole Featuring an Unsymmetrical B=B Entity: A Versatile Synthon for Unusual Boron Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils a 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole, a BN analogue of cyclopentadienide. Featuring an unsymmetrical B=B entity, this species readily undergoes redox, insertion, addition, and cycloaddition reactions for the synthesis of unusual boron heterocycles. The ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion have been witnessed during these transformations.







Abstract
The replacement of a CC unit with an isoelectronic BN unit in aromatic systems can give rise to molecules and materials with fascinating properties. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole species, 2, featuring an unprecedented 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic BN&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that is isoelectronic to cyclopentadienide (Cp&#8722;). Bearing an unsymmetrical B=B entity, 2 exhibits reactivity toward oxidants, protic reagents, electrophiles, and unsaturated substrates. This reactivity facilitates the synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and bicyclic organoboron derivatives through mechanisms including ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion. These findings reveal innovative synthetic routes to BN&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds via desymmetrization, affording unique building blocks for synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Rational Design of the Spatial Effect in a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Reverses the Regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation in Aliphatic Amino Acids</title>

This study addressed the challenge of regioselectivity for remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation. A Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase (BlAH) was mined with a promiscuous hydroxylation for aliphatic amino acids. The regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation could be regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. As a proof of concept, the spatial effect of BlAH was redesigned and reversed the regioselectivity from the &#947; to the &#948; site.







Abstract
The hydroxylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aliphatic amino acids yields crucial precursors for the synthesis of high&#8208;value compounds. However, accurate regulation of the regioselectivity of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds hydroxylation in aliphatic amino acids continues to be a common challenge in chemosynthesis and biosynthesis. In this study, the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BlAH) was mined and found to catalyze hydroxylation at the &#947; and &#948; sites of aliphatic amino acids. Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations revealed that regioselectivity was regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. Based on these results, the spatial effect of BlAH was reconstructed to stabilize the transition state at the &#948; site of aliphatic amino acids, thereby successfully reversing the &#947; site regioselectivity to the &#948; site. For example, the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Homoleucine (5&#8201;a) was reversed from the &#947; site (1&#8201;:&#8201;12) to the &#948; site (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The present study not only expands the toolbox of biocatalysts for the regioselective functionalization of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, but also provides a theoretical guidance for the precision&#8208;driven modification of similarly remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in complex molecules.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Proportion of Grain Boundaries in Zinc Metal Anode Spontaneously Inhibiting Dendrites Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries create abundant nucleation sites, accelerating zinc nucleation and growth rates allowing for the 2D growth kinetics. This offers advantages over the traditional 3D instantaneous nucleation mode of the commercial zinc foil, constrained by limited nucleation sites and kinetics associated with nucleation and growth.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are an attractive electrochemical energy storage solution for their budget and safe properties. However, dendrites and uncontrolled side reactions in anodes detract the cycle life and energy density of the batteries. Grain boundaries in metals are generally considered as the source of the above problems but we present a diverse result. This study introduces an ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries on zinc electrodes through femtosecond laser bombardment to enhance stability of zinc metal/electrolyte interface. The ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries promotes the homogenization of zinc growth potential, to achieve uniform nucleation and growth, thereby suppressing dendrite formation. Additionally, the abundant active sites mitigate the side reactions during the electrochemical process. Consequently, the 15&#8197;&#956;m Fs&#8722;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves an energy density of 249.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and operates for over 60 cycles at a depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 23&#8201;%. The recognition of the favorable influence exerted by UP&#8208;GBs paves a new way for other metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Locked Fluorescent Probes Activated by Aminopeptidase N and the Tumor Redox Environment for High&#8208;Precision Imaging of Tumor Boundaries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of offensive and defensive integration (ODI) strategy&#8208;based fluorescent probes depending on the &#8220;attack and defense systems&#8221; required for the persistence of tumors is reported. FANQ was screened for tumor imaging, distinguishing between cancerous tissue and adjacent tissue with an obvious tumor boundary.







Abstract
Clear delineation of tumor margins is essential for accurate resection and decreased recurrence rate in the clinic. Fluorescence imaging is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional visual inspection by surgeons for intraoperative imaging. However, traditional probes lack accuracy in tumor diagnosis, making it difficult to depict tumor boundaries accurately. Herein, we proposed an offensive and defensive integration (ODI) strategy based on the &#8220;attack systems (invasive peptidase) and defense systems (reductive microenvironment)&#8221; of multi&#8208;dimensional tumor characteristics to design activatable fluorescent probes for imaging tumor boundaries precisely. Screened out from a series of ODI strategy&#8208;based probes, ANQ performed better than traditional probes based on tumor unilateral correlation by distinguishing between tumor cells and normal cells and minimizing false&#8208;positive signals from living metabolic organs. To further improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in vivo, derivatized FANQ, was prepared and successfully applied to distinguish orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from adjacent tissues in mice models and clinical samples. This work highlights an innovative strategy to develop activatable probes for rapid diagnosis of tumors and high&#8208;precision imaging of tumor boundaries, providing more efficient tools for future clinical applications in intraoperative assisted resection.

         <title>Triply Interlocked [2]catenanes: Rational Synthesis, Reversible Conversion Studies and Unprecedented Application in Photothermal Responsive Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triply interlocked [2]catenane exhibiting outstanding photothermal conversion performance was constructed and used as photothermal units in the creation of light&#8208;driven, versatile soft actuators within thermal stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Triply interlocked [2]catenane complexes featuring two identical, mechanically interlocked units are extraordinarily rare chemical compounds, whose properties and applications remain open to detailed studies. Herein, we introduce the rational design of a new ligand precursor, L1, suitable for the synthesis of six triply interlocked [2]catenanes by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The interlocked compounds can be reversibly converted into the corresponding simple triangular prism metallacage by addition of H2O or DMF solvents to their CH3OH solutions, thereby demonstrating the importance of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions in the formation of triply interlocked [2]catenanes. Moreover, extensive studies have been conducted to assess the remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Complex 6&#8201;a, exhibiting outstanding photothermal conversion performance (conversion efficiency in solution : 31.82&#8201;%), is used to prepare novel photoresponsive elastomer in combination with thermally activated liquid crystal elastomer. The resultant material displays robust response to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser and the capability of completely reforming the shape and reversible actuation, paving the way for the application of half&#8208;sandwich organometallic units in photo&#8208;responsive smart materials.

         <title>Approaching Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Voltage&#8208;Responsive Smart Prelithiation Separator with Surface&#8208;Engineered Sacrificial Lithium Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart lithium compensation strategy by introducing voltage&#8208;responsive prelithiation separator can staged release active lithium, regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries and extending their life. The separator's ability to absorb excess lithium below operating voltage protects the cathode from electrochemical failure or short circuit, enhancing safety and sustainability.







Abstract
The surge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries has heightened concerns regarding metal resource depletion and the environmental impact of spent batteries. Battery recycling has become paramount globally, but conventional techniques, while effective at extracting transition metals like cobalt and nickel from cathodes, often overlook widely used spent LiFePO4 due to its abundant and low&#8208;cost iron content. Direct regeneration, a promising approach for restoring deteriorated cathodes, is hindered by practicality and cost issues despite successful methods like solid&#8208;state sintering. Hence, a smart prelithiation separator based on surface&#8208;engineered sacrificial lithium agents is proposed. Benefiting from the synergistic anionic and cationic redox, the prelithiation separator can intelligently release or intake active lithium via voltage regulation. The staged lithium replenishment strategy was implemented, successfully restoring spent LiFePO4&#8217;s capacity to 163.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a doubled life. Simultaneously, the separator can absorb excess active lithium up to approximately 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 below 2.5&#8197;V to prevent over&#8208;lithiation of the cathode This innovative, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective strategy paves the way for the direct regeneration of spent batteries, expanding the possibilities in the realm of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lissodendoric Acid A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy leading to the first total synthesis of lissodendoric acid A is reported. The 12&#8208;step synthesis centers on an enantiospecific Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of a strained azacyclic allene to construct the core of the natural product. The study demonstrates that strained cyclic allenes are valuable synthetic building blocks for total synthesis.

         <title>Unraveling the Unique Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Titanium Dioxide Supported Platinum Clusters for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieve the first construction of strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) between Pt sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets. Unique SMSI behaviors &#8211; ordering process of Pt atoms within clusters and superior stability in oxygen at high temperatures &#8211; are unraveled. Further investigation suggests that the disappeared CO adsorption ability originates from the unique electronic interaction after forming SMSI.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial to modulating the nature of metal species, yet the SMSI behaviors of sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters remain unknown due to the difficulties in constructing SMSI at cluster scale. Herein, we achieve the successful construction of the SMSI between Pt clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets by vacuum annealing, which requires a relatively low temperature that avoids the aggregation of small clusters. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy observation is employed to explore the SMSI behaviors, and the results reveal the dynamic rearrangement of Pt atoms upon annealing for the first time. The originally disordered Pt atoms become ordered as the crystallizing of the amorphous TiO2 support, forming an epitaxial interface between Pt and TiO2. Such a SMSI state can remain stable in oxidation environment even at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further investigations prove that the electron transfer from TiO2 to Pt occupies the Pt 5d orbitals, which is responsible for the disappeared CO adsorption ability of Pt/TiO2 after forming SMSI. This work not only opens a new avenue for constructing SMSI at cluster scale but also provides in&#8208;depth understanding on the unique SMSI behavior, which would stimulate the development of supported metal clusters for catalysis applications.

         <title>Vapor/Vapor&#8208;Solid Interfacial Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes on Alumina Hollow Fiber for Advanced Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) interfacial method, in which vapor&#8208;phase monomers were introduced onto polydopamine(PDA)&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm within 8&#8197;h, ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 membranes were successfully grown on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers substrate. The resulting filtration module exhibits exceptional stability and performance in continuous inside&#8208;out cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their chemical stability and porous crystalline structure, hold promises as advanced separation membranes. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality COF membranes, particularly on industrial&#8208;preferred hollow fiber substrates, remains challenging. This study introduces a novel vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) method for growing ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 COF membranes on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers (TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina). Through vapor&#8208;phase monomer introduction onto polydopamine&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm, efficient polymerization and crystallization occur at the confined V&#8722;S interface. This enables one&#8208;step growth within 8&#8197;h, producing 100&#8197;nm thick COF membranes with strong substrate adhesion. TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina exhibits exceptional stability and performance over 80&#8197;h in continuous cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), with methanol permeance of about 200&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and dye rejection with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 700&#8197;Da. Moreover, the versatile V/V&#8722;S method synthesizes two additional COF membranes (TpPa2Cl/Alumina and TpHz/Alumina) with different pore sizes and chemical environments. Adjusting the COF membrane thickness between 100&#8211;500&#8197;nm is achievable easily by varying the growth cycle numbers. Notably, TpPa2Cl/Alumina demonstrates excellent OSN performance in separating the model active pharmaceutical ingredient glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), highlighting the method's potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>A Simple Organo&#8208;Electrocatalysis System for the Chlor&#8208;Related Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalyst has been applied in the field of electrochemistry. However, the large&#8208;scale production of the catalyst is hard to realize and the catalytic system nowadays is too complex to be applied in the practical production. This work first provides a highly efficient electro&#8208;organocatalyst for chloride ion oxidation both in acidic and neutral processes and cuts the cost down to 0.005&#8201;% compared with that of the dimensionally stable anode (DSA), providing an efficient choice for the chlor&#8208;related industry.







Abstract
Consuming a substantial quantum of energy (~165&#8197;TW&#8201;h), the chlor&#8208;alkali industry garners considerable scholarly and industrial interest, with the anode reaction involving the oxidation of chloride ions being a paramount determinant of reaction rates. While the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) displays commendable catalytic activity and longevity, they rely on precious metals and exhibit a non&#8208;negligible side reaction in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) production, underscoring the appeal of metal&#8208;free alternatives. However, the molecules and systems currently available are characterized by intricate complexity and are not amenable to large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we have successfully developed an economical and highly efficient molecular catalyst, demonstrating superior performance compared with the former organic molecules in the chloride ion oxidation process (COP) for the production of both chlorine gas (Cl2) and NaClO. The molecule of 2N only needs 92&#8197;mV to reach a current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a small cost of only 0.002&#8197;$&#8201;g&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Organocatalyst has been applied in the field of electrochemistry. However, the large-scale production of the catalyst is hard to realize and the catalytic system nowadays is too complex to be applied in the practical production. This work first provides a highly efficient electro-organocatalyst for chloride ion oxidation both in acidic and neutral processes and cuts the cost down to 0.005&#8201;% compared with that of the dimensionally stable anode (DSA), providing an efficient choice for the chlor-related industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consuming a substantial quantum of energy (~165&#8197;TW&#8201;h), the chlor-alkali industry garners considerable scholarly and industrial interest, with the anode reaction involving the oxidation of chloride ions being a paramount determinant of reaction rates. While the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) displays commendable catalytic activity and longevity, they rely on precious metals and exhibit a non-negligible side reaction in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) production, underscoring the appeal of metal-free alternatives. However, the molecules and systems currently available are characterized by intricate complexity and are not amenable to large-scale production. Herein, we have successfully developed an economical and highly efficient molecular catalyst, demonstrating superior performance compared with the former organic molecules in the chloride ion oxidation process (COP) for the production of both chlorine gas (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and NaClO. The molecule of 2N only needs 92&#8197;mV to reach a current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a small cost of only 0.002&#8197;$&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism underpinned by non-covalent interactions, serving as the foundation for an innovative approach to the design of efficient anodes for the COP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressed Dissolution of Fluorine&#8208;Rich SEI Enables Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode for Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;rich SEI dissolution is a major cause of zinc anode failure. The SEI content fluctuates significantly during the plating/stripping process, resulting in an unstable electrode/electrolyte interface. A versatile functional electrolyte additive, thioether&#8208;TX was introduced to reduce solvent polarity, as a poor solvent molecule for F&#8722;. Additionally, TX could modulate the Zn2+ solvation structure and adsorb at the electrode/electrolyte interface to reduce the activity of local water, further suppressing the dissolution of ZnF2 and stabilizing the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer.







Abstract
The instability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is a critical challenge for the zinc metal anodes, leading to an erratic electrode/electrolyte interface and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ultimately resulting in anode failure. This study uncovers that the fluorine species dissolution is the root cause of SEI instability. To effectively suppress the F&#8722; dissolution, an introduction of a low&#8208;polarity molecule, 1,4&#8208;thioxane (TX), is proposed, which reinforces the stability of the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI. Moreover, the TX molecule has a strong affinity for coordinating with Zn2+ and adsorbing at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby diminishing the activity of local water and consequently impeding SEI dissolution. The robust fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer promotes the high durability of the zinc anode in repeated plating/stripping cycles, while concurrently suppressing HER and enhancing Coulombic efficiency. Notably, the symmetric cell with TX demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, sustaining over 500&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Zn||KVOH full cell exhibits excellent capacity retention, averaging 6.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 98&#8201;% retention after 400&#8197;cycles, even at high loading with a lean electrolyte. This work offers a novel perspective on SEI dissolution as a key factor in anode failure, providing valuable insights for the electrolyte design in energy storage devices.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;State Control over Supramolecular Chirality through Dynamic Chemistry Mediated Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;protected fluorinated amino acid was employed as the major building unit to manipulate chirality in multiple&#8208;state switchable states. It flexibly employs constitutional dynamic chemistry including covalent and noncovalent manner to allow five&#8208;state control over supramolecular chirality, shedding light on the rational design of responsive materials as well chiroptical switch.







Abstract
Dynamic chemistry utilizing both covalent and noncovalent bonds provides valid protocols in manipulating properties of self&#8208;assemblies and functions. Here we employ dynamic chemistry to realize multiple&#8208;route control over supramolecular chirality up to five states. N&#8208;protected fluorinated phenylalanine in the carboxylate state self&#8208;assembled into achiral nanoparticles ascribed to the amphiphilicity. Protonation promoted one&#8208;dimensional growth into helices with shrunk hydrophilicity, which in the presence of disulfide pyridine undergo chirality inversion promoted by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;directed coassembly. Further interacting with the water&#8208;soluble reductant cleavages the disulfide bond to initiate the rearrangement of coassemblies with a chirality inversion as well. Finally, by tuning the pH environments, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between reduced products and perfluorinated phenylalanine occurs, giving distinct chiral nanoarchitectures with emerged luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence. We thus realized a particular five&#8208;state control by combining dynamic chemistry at one chiral compound, which greatly enriches the toolbox in fabricating responsive chiroptical materials.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Chelating Intermediate for Air&#8208;Processed Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the lead&#8208;chelating intermediate phase promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at ambient air, bypassing the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. The crystallinity of perovskites and the &#945;&#8208;phase stability are remarkably improved. Consequently, the ambient&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 25.08&#8201;%, along with the high open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.19&#8197;V).







Abstract
Formamidinium&#8208;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite holds promise as a prime candidate in the realm of perovskite photovoltaics. However, the photo&#8208;active &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase, existing as a metastable state, is observable solely at elevated temperatures and is susceptible to degradation into the &#948;&#8208;phase in ambient air. Therefore, the attainment of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 in ambient conditions has become a crucial objective in perovskite research. Here, we proposed an efficient conversion process of PbI2 into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskites in ambient air. This conversion was facilitated by the introduction of chelating molecules, which interacted with PbI2 to form an intermediate phase. Due to the reduced formation barrier resulting from the altered reaction pathway, this stable intermediate phase transitioned directly into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 upon the deposition of the organic cation solution, effectively bypassing the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Consequently, the ambient&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 25.08&#8201;%, along with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V. Furthermore, the unencapsulated devices demonstrated remarkable environmental stability. Notably, this innovative approach promises broad applicability across various chelating molecules, opening new avenues for further progress in the ambient air fabrication of FAPbI3 PSCs.

Tin&#8208;based perovskites hold promise for solar cell and LED applications, but suffer from inherent oxidation issues with the ubiquitous DMSO solvent. NMR spectroscopy reveals SnI2 oxidation kinetics, suggesting water involvement and HI generation. Processing at 60&#8201;&#176;C suppresses the Sn oxidation, improving film quality and PeLEDs. This low&#8208;temperature protocol promises oxidation&#8208;free Sn perovskites, shaping future device fabrication.







Abstract
As a leading contender to replace lead halide perovskites, tin&#8208;based perovskites have demonstrated ever increasing performance in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). They tend to be processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which has been identified as a major contributor to the Sn(II) oxidation during film fabrication, posing a challenge to the further improvement of Sn&#8208;based perovskites. Herein, we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of the oxidation of SnI2, revealing that autoamplification takes place, accelerating the oxidation as the reaction progresses. We propose a mechanism consistent with these observations involving water participation and HI generation. Building upon these insights, we have developed low&#8208;temperature Sn&#8208;based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) processed at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving enhanced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Our research underscores the substantial potential of low&#8208;temperature DMSO solvent processes and DMSO&#8208;free solvent systems for fabricating oxidation&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based perovskites, shaping the future direction in processing Sn&#8208;containing perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;As a leading contender to replace lead halide perovskites, tin-based perovskites have demonstrated ever increasing performance in solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). They tend to be processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which has been identified as a major contributor to the Sn(II) oxidation during film fabrication, posing a challenge to the further improvement of Sn-based perovskites. Herein, we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of the oxidation of SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, revealing that autoamplification takes place, accelerating the oxidation as the reaction progresses. We propose a mechanism consistent with these observations involving water participation and HI generation. Building upon these insights, we have developed low-temperature Sn-based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) processed at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving enhanced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Our research underscores the substantial potential of low-temperature DMSO solvent processes and DMSO-free solvent systems for fabricating oxidation-free Sn-based perovskites, shaping the future direction in processing Sn-containing perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
By using conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan/bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene moieties, two pairs of tetraborated chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence enantiomers have been synthesized that show good photophysical and chiroptical properties. The sulfur atoms accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;% with dissymmetry factors of 0.59/1.2&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
Chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold promise for circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and 3D displays. Herein, we present two pairs of tetraborated intrinsically axial CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials, R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH, with conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan and bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene as chiral sources, which effectively participate in the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals. Due to the heavy&#8208;atom effect, sulfur atoms are introduced to accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process and increase the efficiency of molecules. R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH manifest ultra&#8208;pure blue emission with a maximum at 458/459&#8197;nm with a full width at half maximum of 27&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of 90&#8201;%/91&#8201;%, and dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) of 6.8&#215;10&#8722;4/8.5&#215;10&#8722;4, respectively. Correspondingly, the CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit good performances with an external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;% and |gEL| factors of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;3.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing an arenophile&#8208;mediated photocycloaddition and copper hydride catalysis, we report a formal dearomative hydroamination of nonactivated feedstock arenes, including benzene and naphthalene. A unique selectivity paradigm is rationalized using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and a scalable desymmetrization is developed. This transformation enables efficient access to densely&#8208;functionalized small molecules with multiple stereocenters.







Abstract
Catalytic olefin hydroamination reactions are some of the most atom&#8208;economical transformations that bridge readily available starting materials&#8211;olefins and high&#8208;value&#8208;added amines. Despite significant advances in this field over the last two decades, the formal hydroamination of nonactivated aromatic compounds remains an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report the extension of olefin hydroamination to aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems by using arenophile&#8208;mediated dearomatization and Cu&#8208;catalysis to perform 1,2&#8208;hydroamination on nonactivated arenes. This strategy was applied to a variety of substituted arenes and heteroarenes to provide general access to structurally complex amines. We conducted DFT calculations to inform mechanistic understanding and rationalize unexpected selectivity trends. Furthermore, we developed a practical, scalable desymmetrization to deliver enantioenriched dearomatized products and enable downstream synthetic applications. We ultimately used this dearomative strategy to efficiently synthesize a collection of densely functionalized small molecules.

         <title>Modulating the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Interactions in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 into Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylene&#8208;linked MCOFs with continuously tunable D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions by adjusting the structure of the monomer at the molecular level are synthesized for the first time. Benefiting from the unique moderate D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions with suitable binding ability of intermediate, the obtained TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance for CO2 to formate.







Abstract
Crystalline porous framework materials have attracted tremendous interest in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction owing to their ordered structures and high specific surface areas as well as rich designability, however, still suffer from a lack of accuracy in regulating the binding strength between the catalytic sites and intermediates, which is crucial for optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and expanding the product types. Herein, we report three new kinds of vinylene&#8208;linked metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (TMT&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF, TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF and TMP&#8208;MCOF) with continuously tunable D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions by adjusting the structure of the monomers at the molecular level for realizing efficient electroreduction of CO2 to formate for the first time. Interestingly, compared with TMT&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF and TMP&#8208;MCOF, the TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF exhibited the highest HCOO&#8722; Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 95.6&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs RHE and displayed the FEHCOO&#8208; above 90&#8201;% at the voltage range of &#8722;1.0 to &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is one of the highest among various kinds of reported electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the catalytic sites in TMP&#8208;CH3&#8208;MCOF with unique moderate D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A interactions have suitable binding ability towards the reaction intermediate, which is beneficial for the formation of *HCOO and desorption of *HCOOH, thus effectively promoting the electroreduction of CO2 to formate.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of E&#8722;H (E=C, N) Bonds to Transient Uranium(II) Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of intermolecular oxidative addition involving C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds to a transient U(II) center have been achieved. This study not only broadens the scope of two&#8208;electron oxidative additions for low&#8208;valent uranium centers from C&#8722;H to N&#8722;H bonds but also indicates that intermolecular two&#8208;electron oxidative additions are possible with actinide elements.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxidative addition is one of the most important elementary reactions for d&#8208;block transition metals but it is uncommon for f&#8208;block elements. Here, we report the first examples of intermolecular oxidative addition of E&#8722;H (E=C, N) bonds to uranium(II) centers. The transient U(II) species was formed in&#8208;situ by reducing a heterometallic cluster featuring U(IV)&#8208;Pd(0) bonds with potassium&#8208;graphite (KC8). Oxidative addition of C&#8722;H or N&#8722;H bonds to the U(II) centers was observed when this transient U(II) species was treated with benzene, carbazole or 1&#8208;adamantylamine, respectively. The U(II) centers could also react with tetracene, biphenylene or N2O, leading to the formation of arene reduced U(IV) products and uranyl(VI) species via two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron processes. This study demonstrates that the intermolecular two&#8208;electron oxidative addition reactions are viable for actinide elements.

&lt;p&gt;Two-electron oxidative addition is one of the most important elementary reactions for &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-block transition metals but it is uncommon for &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-block elements. Here, we report the first examples of intermolecular oxidative addition of E&#8722;H (E=C, N) bonds to uranium(II) centers. The transient U(II) species was formed &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; by reducing a heterometallic cluster featuring U(IV)-Pd(0) bonds with potassium-graphite (KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;). Oxidative addition of C&#8722;H or N&#8722;H bonds to the U(II) centers was observed when this transient U(II) species was treated with benzene, carbazole or 1-adamantylamine, respectively. The U(II) centers could also react with tetracene, biphenylene or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, leading to the formation of arene reduced U(IV) products and uranyl(VI) species via two- or four-electron processes. This study demonstrates that the intermolecular two-electron oxidative addition reactions are viable for actinide elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Donor Skeleton on Intramolecular Electron Transfer Amount for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We multidimensionally reveal the relationship between passivation strength of organic passivator on perovskite film and the spin&#8208;state electronic structure of intermediate donor skeleton. Agreeing well with the calculated amounts of transferred electron between D&#8722;A pairs, the best benzene&#8208;amide pair delivers a champion efficiency of 15.51&#8201;% for carbon&#8208;based, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell and 24.20&#8201;% in an inverted (Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9)Pb(I0.93Br0.07)3 cell.







Abstract
The passivation of the defects derived from rapid&#8208;crystallization with electron&#8208;donating molecules is always a prerequisite to obtain desirable perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells, thus, the in&#8208;depth understanding on the correlations between molecular structure and passivation capacity is of great importance for screening passivators. Here, we introduce the double&#8208;ended amide molecule into perovskite precursor solution to modulate crystallization process and passivate defects. By regulating the intermediate bridging skeletons with alkyl, alkenyl and benzene groups, the results show the passivation strength highly depends on the spin&#8208;state electronic structure that serves as an intrinsic descriptor to determine the intramolecular charge distribution by controlling orbital electron transfer from the donor segment to acceptor segment. Upon careful optimization, the benzene&#8208;bridged amide molecule demonstrates superior efficacy on improving perovskite film quality. As a physical proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the carbon&#8208;based, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell delivers a significantly increased efficiency of 15.51&#8201;% with a remarkably improved stability. Based on the same principle, a champion efficiency of 24.20&#8201;% is further obtained on the inverted (Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9)Pb(I0.93Br0.07)3 solar cell. These findings provide new fundamental insights into the influence of spin&#8208;state modulation on effective perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Dynamic Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Encoded by Transient Supramolecular Chiral Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;triggered transient supramolecular chiral assemblies that exhibit dynamic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high glum value of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2 were developed by coupling assembly&#8208;encoded emission to an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction network. Exploiting the dynamic NIR CPL enabled multilevel advanced information encryption to be achieved.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is promising for applications in many fields. However, most systems involving CPL are within the visible range; near&#8208;infrared (NIR) CPL&#8208;active materials, especially those that exhibit high glum values and can be controlled spatially and temporally, are rare. Herein, dynamic NIR&#8208;CPL with a glum value of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2 was achieved through supramolecular coassembly and energy&#8208;transfer strategies. The chiral assemblies formed by the coassembly between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a pyrene derivative exhibited a red CPL signal (glum of 10&#8722;3). The further introduction of sulfo&#8208;cyanine5 resulted in a energy&#8208;transfer process, which not only led to the NIR CPL but also increased the glum value to 10&#8722;2. Temporal control of these chiral assemblies was realized by introducing alkaline phosphatase to fabricate a biomimetic enzyme&#8208;catalyzed network, allowing the dynamic NIR CPL signal to be turned on. Based on these enzyme&#8208;regulated temporally controllable dynamic CPL&#8208;active chiral assemblies, a multilevel information encryption system was further developed. This study provides a pioneering example for the construction of dynamic NIR CPL materials with the ability to perform temporal control via the supramolecular assembly strategy, which is expected to aid in the design of supramolecular complex systems that more closely resemble natural biological systems.

         <title>Scalable and Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Polycyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons has been proposed. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate that the selectivity is attributed to combined effects of in situ released protons during anodic oxidation and significant differences in H+ mobility among various solvents.







Abstract
The reduction of aromatic compounds constitutes a fundamental and ongoing area of investigation. The selective reduction of polycyclic aromatic compounds to give either fully or partially reduced products remains a challenge, especially in applications to complex molecules at scale. Herein, we present a selective electrochemical hydrogenation of polycyclic arenes conducted under mild conditions. A noteworthy achievement of this approach is the ability to finely control both the complete and partial reduction of specific aromatic rings within polycyclic arenes by judiciously varying the reaction solvents. Mechanistic investigations elucidate the pivotal role played by in situ proton generation and interface regulation in governing reaction selectivity. The reductive electrochemical conditions show a very high level of functional&#8208;group tolerance. Furthermore, this methodology represents an easily scalable reduction (demonstrated by the reduction of 1&#8197;kg scale starting material) using electrochemical flow chemistry to give key intermediates for the synthesis of specific drugs.

A tale of a &#8216;naked&#8217; acyclic gallyl and indyl compounds: By exploiting the electronic prowess of N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) groups, &#8242;naked&#8242; acyclic gallyl and indyl anions from [KGa{OB(NDippCH)2}2] and [KIn{OB(NDippCH)2}2] were obtained by K+ extraction, thereby resulting in the first O&#8208;ligated gallyl/indyl systems. The nucleophilicity of these trielyl species can be tuned by the presence of the K+ counterion.







Abstract
By exploiting the electronic capabilities of the N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligand, we have synthesized &#8220;naked&#8221; acyclic gallyl [Ga{OB(NDippCH)2}2]&#8722; and indyl [In{OB(NDippCH)2}2]&#8722; anions (as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts) through K+ abstraction from [KGa{OB(NDippCH)2}2] and [KIn{OB(NDippCH)2}2] using 2.2.2&#8208;crypt. These systems represent the first O&#8208;ligated gallyl/indyl systems, are ultimately accessed from cyclopentadienyl GaI/InI precursors by substitution chemistry, and display nucleophilic reactivity which is strongly influenced by the presence (or otherwise) of the K+ counterion.

         <title>Management of Triplet States in Modified Mononuclear Ruthenium(II) Complexes for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a Ru(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons to transition their excited state from 3MLCT to 3IL, is presented. RuP&#8208;4 catalyzes CO2 photoreduction to CO with unprecedented performance without additional photosensitizers.







Abstract
Controlling the interplay between relaxation and charge/energy transfer processes in the excited states of photocatalysts is crucial for the performance of artificial photosynthesis. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer triplet states (3MLCT*) of ruthenium(II) complexes are broadly implemented for photocatalysis, but an effective means of managing the triplets for enhanced photocatalysis has been lacking. Herein, We proposed a strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a ruthenium(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Systematic studies demonstrate that in RuP&#8208;4 decorated with anthracene, sub&#8208;picosecond electron transfer from anthracene to 3MLCT* leads to a charge&#8208;separated state that can mediate the formation of the intra&#8208;ligand triplet state (3IL) of anthracene, resulting in an exceptionally long excited&#8208;state up to several milliseconds. This triplet management strategy enables impressive photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 404, an optimized quantum yield of 43&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% selectivity, which is the highest reported performance for mononuclear photocatalysts without additional photosensitizers. RuP&#8208;4 also catalyzes photochemical hydrogen generation under argon. This work opens up an avenue for regulating the excited&#8208;state charge/energy flow for the development of long&#8208;lived 3IL multi&#8208;functional mononuclear photocatalysts to boost artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Interfacial Super&#8208;Assembly of Vacancy Engineered Ultrathin&#8208;Nanosheets Toward Nanochannels for Smart Ion Transport and Salinity Gradient Power Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vacancy&#8208;engineered layered double hydroxide/cellulose nanofibers wrapped carbon nanotubes (VOLDH/CNF&#8208;CNT) composite membrane was prepared by interfacial super&#8208;assembly. Synergistic combination of vacancy&#8208;engineering and super&#8208;assembly validates the membrane with improved surface charge density. Benefiting from the angstrom scale channels and abundant surface charge density, it exhibits size exclusion effect and charge selectivity.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective nanochannel membranes assembled from two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets hold immense promise for power conversion using salinity gradient. However, they face challenges stemming from insufficient surface charge density, which impairs both permselectivity and durability. Herein, we present a novel vacancy&#8208;engineered, oxygen&#8208;deficient NiCo layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH)/cellulose nanofibers&#8208;wrapped carbon nanotubes (VOLDH/CNF&#8208;CNT) composite membrane. This membrane, featuring abundant angstrom&#8208;scale, cation&#8208;selective nanochannels, is designed and fabricated through a synergistic combination of vacancy engineering and interfacial super&#8208;assembly. The composite membrane shows interlayer free&#8208;spacing of ~3.62&#8197;&#197;, which validates the membrane size exclusion selectivity. This strategy, validated by DFT calculations and experimental data, improves hydrophilicity and surface charge density, leading to the strong interaction with K+ ions to benefit the low ion transport resistance and exceptional charge selectivity. When employed in an artificial river water|seawater salinity gradient power generator, it delivers a high&#8208;power density of 5.35&#8197;W/m2 with long&#8208;term durability (20,000s), which is almost 400&#8201;% higher than that of the pristine NiCoLDH membrane. Furthermore, it displays both pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive ion transport behavior, offering additional opportunities for optimization. This work establishes a basis for high&#8208;performance salinity gradient power conversion and underscores the potential of vacancy engineering and super&#8208;assembly in customizing 2D nanomaterials for diverse advanced nanofluidic energy devices.

         <title>Reactivity and Steric Parameters from 2D to 3D Bulky Pyridines: Increasing Steric Demand at Nitrogen with Chiral Azatriptycenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sterically hindered chiral pyridines were synthesized and resolved by HPLC. Their Br&#248;nsted/Lewis basicity were evaluated, and their reactivity was studied through their combination with Pd and B(C6F5)3 to generate new types of ligands/frustrated Lewis pairs. The study involved the first parameterization of the steric hindrance for a large set of pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
Sterically hindered pyridines embedded in a three&#8208;dimensional triptycene framework have been synthesized, and their resolution by chiral HPLC enabled access to unprecedented enantiopure pyridines exceeding the known steric limits. The design principles for new axially chiral pyridine derivatives are then described. To rationalize their associations with Lewis acids and transition metals, a comprehensive determination of the steric and electronic parameters for this new class of pyridines was performed. This led to the general parameterization of the steric parameters (percent buried volume %VBur, Tolman cone angle &#952;, and He8_steric descriptor) for a large set of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional pyridine derivatives. These parameters are shown to describe quantitatively their interactions with carbon&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and were used to predict the &#916;G&#176; of association with the prototypical B(C6F5)3 Lewis acid widely used in frustrated Lewis pair catalysis. This first parameterization of pyridine sterics is a fundamental basis for the future development of predictive reactivity models and for guiding new applications of bulky and chiral pyridines in organocatalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs, and transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Concomitant Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermy and Photoluminescence of Rod&#8208;Shaped Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 Synthesized Concurrently</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two rod&#8208;shaped Au52(PET)32&#8208;G and Au66(PET)38 are synthesized and precisely characterized. Basing on the unreported transverse growth mode from Au52(PET)32&#8208;G to Au66(PET)38, six novel nanoclusters are predicted. Although the two nanoclusters have different aspect ratios and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light collection abilities, they have concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under NIR irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance.







Abstract
Gold nanoclusters exhibiting concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation are rarely reported, and some fundamental issues remain unresolved for such materials. Herein, we concurrently synthesized two novel rod&#8208;shaped Au nanoclusters, Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate), and precisely revealed that their kernels were 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 and 5 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structures, respectively, based on the numbers of Au layers in the [100], [010], and [001] directions. Following the structural growth mode from Au52(PET)32 to Au66(PET)38, we predicted six more novel nanoclusters. The concurrent synthesis provides rational comparison of the two nanoclusters on the stability, absorption, emission and photothermy, and reveals the aspect ratio&#8208;related properties. An interesting finding is that the two nanoclusters exhibit concomitant PT and PL under 785&#8197;nm light irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance, which was explained by the qualitative evaluation of the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates. The ligand effects on PT and PL were also investigated.

         <title>Switchable Dual Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Chiral Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored through&#8208;space conjugated chiral foldamers exhibiting switchable dual circularly polarized luminescence with opposite signs at different emission wavelengths are successfully realized, which are attributed to the two transformable secondary structures of opposite chirality.







Abstract
Organic materials with switchable dual circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are highly desired because they can not only directly radiate tunable circularly polarized light themselves but also induce CPL for guests by providing a chiral environment in self&#8208;assembled structures or serving as the hosts for energy transfer systems. However, most organic molecules only exhibit single CPL and it remains challenging to develop organic molecules with dual CPL. Herein, novel through&#8208;space conjugated chiral foldamers are constructed by attaching two biphenyl arms to the 9,10&#8208;positions of phenanthrene, and switchable dual CPL with opposite signs at different emission wavelengths are successfully realized in the foldamers containing high&#8208;polarizability substitutes (cyano, methylthiol and methylsulfonyl). The combined experimental and computational results demonstrate that the intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation has significant contributions to stabilizing the folded conformations. Upon photoexcitation in high&#8208;polar solvents, strong interactions between the biphenyl arms substituted with cyano, methylthio or methylsulfonyl and the polar environment induce conformation transformation for the foldamers, resulting in two transformable secondary structures of opposite chirality, accounting for the dual CPL with opposite signs. These findings highlight the important influence of the secondary structures on the chiroptical property of the foldamers and pave a new avenue towards efficient and tunable dual CPL materials.

         <title>Unraveling Stoichiometry Effect in Nickel&#8208;Tungsten Alloys for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloying nickel with tungsten can tailor the catalytic surface to favor hydroxyl adsorption, tuning the connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Accordingly, the optimal Ni17W3 alloy exhibits hydrogen oxidation catalytic activity superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum catalyst in alkali and operates steadily with negligible decay after 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells provide the possibility to use platinum group metal&#8208;free catalysts, but the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffers from sluggish kinetics and its source is still debated. Here, over nickel&#8208;tungsten (Ni&#8722;W) alloy catalysts, we show that the Ni&#8201;:&#8201;W ratio greatly governs the HOR performance in alkaline electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies unravel that alloying with W can tune the unpaired electrons in Ni, tailoring the potential of zero charge and the catalytic surface to favor hydroxyl adsorption (OHad). The OHad species coordinately interact with potassium (K+) ions, which break the K+ solvation sheath to leave free water molecules, yielding an improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Consequently, the optimal Ni17W3 alloy exhibits alkaline HOR activity superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst and operates steadily with negligible decay after 10,000&#8197;cycles. Our findings offer new understandings of alloyed HOR catalysts and will guide rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for fuel cells.

         <title>Controlling the Orientation&#8208;Dependent Second Harmonic Generation in Hybrid Germanium Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet engineering is an effective approach to enhance second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the larger polarization from the higher in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density within the (101) MAGeI3, results in the stronger SHG in the (101)&#8208;oriented than the (210)&#8208;oriented methylammonium germanium iodide crystals.







Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation plays a crucial role in the conversion efficiency during second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we provide a new strategy in controlling the surface&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG with the precise design of (101) and (2

Temperature&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy show shorter lifetime and wider emission band in the (101) MAGeI3 single crystal, revealing the higher defect states. Additionally, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns show the (101) MAGeI3 possesses larger in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density, which could directly enhance the spontaneous polarization in the (101) facet.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;breaking of Dibenzo[b,d]thiophene Sulfone Enhancing Polaron Generation for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents BBTT&#8208;1SO, a novel acceptor unit designed by breaking the symmetry of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS). Its asymmetric structure enhances octapole moment and polarizability compared to DBS&#8208;containing counterparts. Transient spectroscopy demonstrates efficient generation of electron polarons in BBTT&#8208;1SO polymers, contributing to their superior hydrogen evolution rate compared to DBS&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
The current bottleneck in the development of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution is the limited availability of high&#8208;performance acceptor units. Over the past nine years, dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS) has been the preferred choice for the acceptor unit. Despite extensive exploration of alternative structures as potential replacements for DBS, a superior substitute remains elusive. In this study, a symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy was employed on DBS to develop a novel acceptor unit, BBTT&#8208;1SO. The asymmetric structure of BBTT&#8208;1SO proved beneficial for increasing multiple moment and polarizability. BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;containing polymers showed higher efficiencies for hydrogen evolution than their DBS&#8208;containing counterparts by up to 166&#8201;%. PBBTT&#8208;1SO exhibited an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 222.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm. Transient spectroscopic studies indicated that the BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;based polymers facilitated electron polaron formation, which explains their superior HERs. PBBTT&#8208;1SO also showed 14&#8201;% higher HER in natural seawater splitting than that in deionized water splitting. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the enhanced water&#8208;PBBTT&#8208;1SO polymer interactions in salt&#8208;containing solutions. This study presents a pioneering example of a substitute acceptor unit for DBS in the construction of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mechanistic Depiction of Photoinduced CO2 Reduction Catalysis on a Urea&#8208;Modified Iron Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pump&#8208;pump excitation strategy induces effective accumulation of charge on an FeIII&#8208;based urea&#8208;modified porphyrin as the fates of the photogenerated species are tracked through their optical transient absorption signatures. In the presence of CO2 as a substrate and H2O as a proton source, the two&#8208;electron accumulated species leads to CO2 activation and reduction, generating FeII&#8208;CO as a stable intermediate in the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light&#8208;induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea&#8208;modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFeIII) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFeII and UrFeI reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick&#8208;started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal FeI oxidation state.

         <title>Designing Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Selectively Converting CO2 into Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the theoretical predictions, a high&#8208;performance catalyst with oxophilic Mo single atoms and Pt nanoparticles was successfully synthesized. When applied in CO2 hydrogenation, the obtained dual&#8208;site catalyst induces selectively the generation of methanol in high rate (0.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The synergistic effect of Pt nanoparticles and Mo single atoms efficiently change the adsorption configuration and conversion pathway of the key intermediate *OCH2.







Abstract
The variability of CO2 hydrogenation reaction demands new potential strategies to regulate the fine structure of the catalysts for optimizing the reaction pathways. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;site strategy to boost the catalytic efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion. A new descriptor, &#964;, was initially established for screening the promising candidates with low&#8208;temperature activation capability of CO2, and sequentially a high&#8208;performance catalyst was fabricated centred with oxophilic Mo single atoms, who was further decorated with Pt nanoparticles. In CO2 hydrogenation, the obtained dual&#8208;site catalysts possess a remarkably&#8208;improved methanol generation rate (0.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). For comparison, the singe&#8208;site Mo and Pt&#8208;based catalysts can only produce ethanol and formate acid at a relatively low reaction rate (0.11&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethanol and 0.034&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for formate acid), respectively. Mechanism studies indicate that the introduction of Pt species could create an active hydrogen&#8208;rich environment, leading to the alterations of the adsorption configuration and conversion pathways of the *OCH2 intermediates on Mo sites. As a result, the catalytic selectivity was successfully switched.

         <title>Multifunctional Buffer Layer Engineering for Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>

A facile strategy incorporating AlOx deposited by controlled growth was developed to modulate the perovskite surface. The infiltrated Al3+ can suppress ion migration and phase separation, regulate the arrangement of energy levels, and passivate defects on the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. A monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cell achieved a PCE of 28.50&#8201;% with excellent photothermal stability.







Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are preferred for tandem applications due to their superior compatibility with diverse bottom solar cells. However, the solution processing and low formation energy of perovskites inevitably lead to numerous defects at both the bulk and interfaces. We report a facile and effective strategy for precisely modulating the perovskite by incorporating AlOx deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the top interface. We find that Al3+ can not only infiltrate the bulk phase and interact with halide ions to suppress ion migration and phase separation but also regulate the arrangement of energy levels and passivate defects on the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Additionally, ALD&#8208;AlOx exhibits an encapsulation effect through a dense interlayer. Consequently, the ALD&#8208;AlOx treatment can significantly improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 21.80&#8201;% for 1.66 electron volt (eV) PSCs. A monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon TSCs using AlOx&#8208;modified perovskite achieved a PCE of 28.5&#8201;% with excellent photothermal stability. More importantly, the resulting 1.55&#8197;eV PSC and module achieved a PCE of 25.08&#8201;% (0.04&#8197;cm2) and 21.01&#8201;% (aperture area of 15.5&#8197;cm2), respectively. Our study provides an effective way to efficient and stable wide&#8208;band gap perovskite for perovskite&#8208;silicon TSCs and paves the way for large&#8208;area inverted PSCs.

         <title>Facile Access to Organostibines via Selective Organic Superbase Catalyzed Antimony&#8208;Carbon Protonolysis</title>

C6F5, the perfect leaving group for highly selective antimony&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions via organosuperbase&#8208;catalysis! This novel approach enables mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted perfluorophenyl stibines to be smoothly converted to a range of synthetically useful aromatic, heteroaromatic and alkynyl&#8208;substituted stibines under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
The selective formation of antimony&#8208;carbon bonds via organic superbase catalysis under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions is reported. This novel approach utilizes electron&#8208;deficient stibine, Sb(C6F5)3, to give upon base&#8208;catalyzed reactions with weakly acidic aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons access to a range of new aromatic and heteroaromatic stibines, respectively, with loss of C6HF5. Also, the significantly less electron&#8208;deficient stibines, Ph2SbC6F5 and PhSb(C6F5)2 smoothly underwent base&#8208;catalyzed exchange reactions with a range of terminal alkynes to generate the stibines of formulae PhSb(C&#8801;CPh)2, and Ph2SbC&#8801;CR [R=C6H5, C6H4&#8208;NO2, COOEt, CH2Cl, CH2NEt2, CH2OSiMe3, Sb(C6H5)2], respectively. These formal substitution reactions proceed with high selectivity as only the C6F5 groups serve as a leaving group to be liberated as C6HF5 upon formal proton transfer from the alkyne. Kinetic studies of the base&#8208;catalyzed reaction of Ph2SbC6F5 with phenyl acetylene to form Ph2SbC&#8801;CPh and C6HF5 suggested the empirical rate law to exhibit a first&#8208;order dependence with respect to the base catalyst, alkyne and stibine. DFT calculations support a pathway proceeding via a concerted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis transition state, where the base catalyst activates the Sb&#8208;C6F5 bond sequence through secondary bond interactions.

Also, the significantly less electron-deficient stibines, Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and PhSb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; smoothly underwent base-catalyzed exchange reactions with a range of terminal alkynes to generate the stibines of formulae PhSb(C&#8801;CPh)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbC&#8801;CR [R=C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOEt, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], respectively. These formal substitution reactions proceed with high selectivity as only the C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; groups serve as a leaving group to be liberated as C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; upon formal proton transfer from the alkyne. Kinetic studies of the base-catalyzed reaction of Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with phenyl acetylene to form Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbC&#8801;CPh and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; suggested the empirical rate law to exhibit a first-order dependence with respect to the base catalyst, alkyne and stibine. DFT calculations support a pathway proceeding via a concerted &#963;-bond metathesis transition state, where the base catalyst activates the Sb-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; bond sequence through secondary bond interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Ultrathin CuxS Layer on Planar Sb2S3 Photocathode to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a back contact for Sb2S3, an ultrathin CuxS layer has been successfully engineered for the first time to fabricate a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Sb2S3/CuxS hole&#8208;transparent structure. With a substantial work function of 4.90&#8197;eV for CuxS layer, the transparent Sb2S3/CuxS platform enabled flexible integration of intricate catalyst layers at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for efficient photoelectrochemical transformation.







Abstract
Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p&#8208;type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90&#8197;eV, which causes the upward band bending of p&#8208;type Sb2S3, forming a hole&#8208;transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back&#8208;illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches &#8722;5.38&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0&#8197;V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.

         <title>A Highly Reversible Sn&#8208;Air Battery Possessing the Ultra&#8208;Low Charging Potential with the Assistance of Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable Sn&#8208;air battery using Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti multi&#8208;functional catalytic cathode is proposed for the first time. Due to the heterogeneous Fe2O3@TiO2&#8208;induced high photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic performances, the corresponding Sn&#8208;air battery has achieved the ultra&#8208;low charge/discharge overpotential of ~40&#8197;mV and stably cycled for 160&#8197;hours under irradiation.







Abstract
Aqueous Sn&#8208;air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra&#8208;high safety, low cost, dendrite&#8208;free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn&#8208;air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000&#8197;mV) of these Sn&#8208;air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti films are further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn&#8208;air batteries. The core&#8211;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes to activate oxygen&#8208;related reaction processes. Density functional theory (DFT) and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo&#8208;catalytic activity to promote charging kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Sn&#8208;air batteries show ultra&#8208;low overpotential of ~40&#8197;mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo&#8208;assisted catalytic cathode design for new&#8208;type metal&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Performance Cobalt&#8208;Based Environmental Catalysts from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Unveiling Overlooked Roles of Copper and Aluminum from Current Collectors</title>

The role of trace metals from current collectors on the activity of environmental catalysts converted from spent LIBs was revealed by a Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Al and Cu from current collectors could tune the d&#8208;band centre of active sites, leading to improved conductivity and strengthened chemisorption ability toward reactants, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of environmental catalysts converted from spent LIBs.







Abstract
Converting spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials into environmental catalysts has drawn more and more attention. Herein, we fabricated a Co3O4&#8208;based catalyst from spent LiCoO2 LIBs (Co3O4&#8208;LIBs) and found that the role of Al and Cu from current collectors on its performance is nonnegligible. The density functional theory calculations confirmed that the doping of Al and/or Cu upshifts the d&#8208;band center of Co. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was adopted to evaluate its activity. Interestingly, Al doping strengthened chemisorption for PMS (from &#8722;2.615&#8197;eV to &#8722;2.623&#8197;eV) and shortened Co&#8722;O bond length (from 2.540&#8197;&#197; to 2.344&#8197;&#197;) between them, whereas Cu doping reduced interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance (from 28.347&#8197;k&#937; to 6.689&#8197;k&#937;) excepting for the enhancement of the above characteristics. As expected, the degradation activity toward bisphenol A of Co3O4&#8208;LIBs (0.523&#8197;min&#8722;1) was superior to that of Co3O4 prepared from commercial CoC2O4 (0.287&#8197;min&#8722;1). Simultaneously, the reasons for improved activity were further verified by comparing activity with catalysts doped Al and/or Cu into Co3O4. This work reveals the role of elements from current collectors on the performance of functional materials from spent LIBs, which is beneficial to the sustainable utilization of spent LIBs.

         <title>Scalable Precise Nanofilm Coating and Gradient Al Doping Enable Stable Battery Cycling of LiCoO2 at 4.7&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The overgrowth of surface CEI and the irreversible phase transition from H1&#8211;3 to O1 are the primary causes of LiCoO2 cathode degradation at 4.7&#8197;V. These phenomena can be significantly suppressed by employing an ultrathin, dense LiAlO2 surface coating and Al gradient doping, which enables a stable cycling of LiCoO2 at 4.7&#8197;V.







Abstract
The quest for smart electronics with higher energy densities has intensified the development of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 (LCO). Despite their potential, LCO materials operating at 4.7&#8197;V faces critical challenges, including interface degradation and structural collapse. Herein, we propose a collective surface architecture through precise nanofilm coating and doping that combines an ultra&#8208;thin LiAlO2 coating layer and gradient doping of Al. This architecture not only mitigates side reactions, but also improves the Li+ migration kinetics on the LCO surface. Meanwhile, gradient doping of Al inhibited the severe lattice distortion caused by the irreversible phase transition of O3&#8722;H1&#8722;3&#8722;O1, thereby enhanced the electrochemical stability of LCO during 4.7&#8197;V cycling. DFT calculations further revealed that our approach significantly boosts the electronic conductivity. As a result, the modified LCO exhibited an outstanding reversible capacity of 230&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4.7&#8197;V, which is approximately 28&#8201;% higher than the conventional capacity at 4.5&#8197;V. To demonstrate their practical application, our cathode structure shows improved stability in full pouch cell configuration under high operating voltage. LCO exhibited an excellent cycling stability, retaining 82.33&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 4.5&#8197;V. This multifunctional surface modification strategy offers a viable pathway for the practical application of LCO materials, setting a new standard for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;lasting electrode materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterometallic [2]Catenanes and Cyclic Bis[2]catenanes via Orthogonal Metal&#8208;Coordination Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes were prepared efficiently via orthogonal metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the multiple positively charged nature, as well as the potential synergistic effect of the Cu(I) and Pt(II) metal ions, the cyclic bis[2]catenanes displayed broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity.







Abstract
Although catenated cages have been widely constructed due to their unique and elegant topological structures, cyclic catenanes formed by the connection of multiple catenane units have been rarely reported. Herein, based on the orthogonal metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we prepare a series of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes, whose structures are clearly evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the multiple positively charged nature, as well as the potential synergistic effect of the Cu(I) and Pt(II) metal ions, the cyclic bis[2]catenanes display broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. This work not only provides an efficient strategy for the construction of heterometallic [2]catenanes and cyclic bis[2]catenanes but also explores their applications as superior antibacterial agents, which will promote the construction of advanced supramolecular structures for biomedical applications.

         <title>Protonation of an Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis under Visible Light up to 700&#8201;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation is found to be a simple and efficient strategy to upgrade the COFs&#8217; photocatalytic activity for H2O2 synthesis. The protonation extends the light absorption, provides proton sources for H2O2 generation, simplifies the reaction pathways, and increases the H2O2 selectivity from oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for H2O2 production from water via oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of COFs for efficient H2O2 production indubitably hinges on an in&#8208;depth understanding of their ORR mechanisms. In this work, taking an imine&#8208;linked COF as an example, we demonstrate that protonation of the functional units such as imine, amine, and triazine, is a highly efficient strategy to upgrade the activity levels for H2O2 synthesis. The protonation not only extends the light absorption of the COF but also provides proton sources that directly participate in H2O2 generation. Notably, the protonation simplifies the reaction pathways of ORR to H2O2, i.e. from an indirect superoxide radical (

O2&#8226;-

 ${{O}_{2}^{\bullet -}}$



) mediated route to a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron route. Theoretical calculations confirm that the protonation favors H2O2 synthesis due to easy access of protons near the reaction sites that removes the energy barrier for generating *OOH intermediate. These findings not only extend the mechanistic insight into H2O2 photosynthesis but also provide a rational guideline for the design and upgradation of efficient COFs.

         <title>Modulating the Electrolyte Microenvironment in Electrical Double Layer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy by mediating alkali metal cations in electrical double layer is proposed to enhance the nitrate reduction reaction performance. The activity, Faraday efficiency, selectivity, and yield of ammonia synthesis follow the increasing order Li+&lt;Cs+&lt;Na+&lt;K+, originating from the accelerated proton transport rate and improved activity of the rate&#8208;determining step (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) in K+&#8208;containing electrolyte.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to achieve remediation of nitrate&#8208;polluted wastewater and sustainable production of ammonia. However, it is still restricted by the low activity, selectivity and Faraday efficiency for ammonia synthesis. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to modulate the electrolyte microenvironment in electrical double layer (EDL) by mediating alkali metal cations in the electrolyte to enhance the NO3RR performance. Taking bulk Cu as a model catalyst, the experimental study reveals that the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 performance in different electrolytes follows the trend Li+&lt;Cs+&lt;Na+&lt;K+. Theoretical studies illustrate that the proton transport rate in NO3RR and the activity of the rate&#8208;determining step (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) increase in the order Li+&lt;Cs+&lt;Na+&lt;K+. The cation effects are also general for two typical nanostructured catalysts including copper/cuprous oxide and nickel phosphides, achieving near&#8208;100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and over 99&#8201;% conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NO3&#8722; can be converted to high&#8208;purity NH4Cl by copper/cuprous oxide catalyst in K+&#8208;containing electrolyte.

         <title>pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density on Doping&#8208;Engineered Bismuth Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;doped metallic Bi catalyst was formed by the electrochemical reconstruction of Bi2S3, which delivers outstanding performance in converting CO2 to formate/formic acid across a range of pH conditions. The simultaneous production of formate on both cathode and anode was also achieved by coupling CO2 reduction reaction with glycerol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The practical application of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to form formic acid fuel is hindered by the limited activation of CO2 molecules and the lack of universal feasibility across different pH levels. Herein, we report a doping&#8208;engineered bismuth sulfide pre&#8208;catalyst (BiS&#8208;1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS&#8208;1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95&#8201;% at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS&#8208;1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95&#8201;%) with current densities from 100 to 1300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while maintaining a FE of above 90&#8201;% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation. This work develops the efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable formate/formic acid production.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Iron(II) Catalyst for C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined iron catalyst with high efficiency for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling involving C(sp3) partners is described. In the presence of a lithium amide base, this catalyst enabled, for the first time, C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; alkyl halides and (hetero)aryl boronic esters as well as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl halides and 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl boranes under mild conditions and with broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Despite the paramount importance of the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) in academia and industry, and the great promise of iron to offer sustainable catalysis, iron&#8208;catalyzed SMC involving sp3&#8208;hybridized partners is still in its infancy. We herein report the development of a versatile, well&#8208;defined electron&#8208;deficient anilido&#8208;aldimine iron(II) catalyst. This catalyst effectively performed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) SMC of alkyl halide electrophiles and (hetero)aryl boronic ester and alkyl borane nucleophiles respectively, in the presence of a lithium amide base. These couplings operated under mild reaction conditions and displayed wide functional group compatibility including various medicinally relevant N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;based heterocycles. They also tolerated primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), electron&#8208;neutral, &#8208;rich and &#8208;poor boronic esters and primary and secondary alkyl boranes. Our methodology could be directly and efficiently applied to synthesize key intermediates relevant to pharmaceuticals and a potential drug candidate. For C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) couplings, radical probe experiments militated in favor of a carbon&#8208;centered radical derived from the electrophile. At the same time, reactions run with a pre&#8208;formed activated boron nucleophile coupled to competition experiments supported the involvement of neutral, rather than an anionic, (hetero)aryl boronic ester in the key transmetalation step.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal Nanowire Networks by Microfluidic Laminar Flow Synthesis for Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of 2D MNWNs in microfluidic systems through precise control of growth kinetics via spatial confinement and shear&#8208;induced phenomena. A novel approach for the direct synthesis of ultra&#8208;large two&#8208;dimensional metal nanowire networks (2D MNWNs) catalysts was developed based on spatial confinement assembly and laminar shear effect. The PdBi 2D MNWNs affords the exceptional activity and stability for formic acid electrooxidation. The present study expands the potential applications in nanomaterial production through microfluidics.







Abstract
Despite the great research interest in two&#8208;dimensional metal nanowire networks (2D MNWNs) due to their large specific surface area and abundance of unsaturated coordination atoms, their controllable synthesis still remains a significant challenge. Herein, a microfluidics laminar flow&#8208;based approach is developed, enabling the facile preparation of large&#8208;scale 2D structures with diverse alloy compositions, such as PtBi, AuBi, PdBi, PtPdBi, and PtAuCu alloys. Remarkably, these 2D MNWNs can reach sizes up to submillimeter scale (~220&#8197;&#956;m), which is significantly larger than the evolution from the 1D or 3D counterparts that typically measure only tens of nanometers. The PdBi 2D MNWNs affords the highest specific activity for formic acid (2669.1&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1) among current unsupported catalysts, which is 103.5 times higher than Pt&#8208;black, respectively. Furthermore, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments provide comprehensive evidence that PdBi 2D MNWNs catalysts can effectively prevent CO* poisoning, resulting in exceptional activity and stability for the oxidation of formic acid.

         <title>A General Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation strategy that occurs under extraordinarily mild conditions, displays high functional group tolerance, and has a broad substrate scope. We conducted a detailed mechanistic study of the transformation, underpinning the further development of iron&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylative methodologies.







Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming reaction under mild, base&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. The transformation uses readily available and structurally diverse carboxylic acids, iron photocatalyst, and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) derivatives as oxygenation reagents. The process exhibits a broad scope in acids possessing a wide range of stereoelectronic properties and functional groups. The developed reaction was applied to late&#8208;stage oxygenation of a series of bio&#8208;active molecules. The reaction leverages the ability of iron complexes to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals directly from carboxylic acids by photoinduced carboxylate&#8208;to&#8208;iron charge transfer. Kinetic, electrochemical, EPR, UV/Vis, HRMS, and DFT studies revealed that TEMPO has a triple role in the reaction: as an oxygenation reagent, an oxidant to turn over the Fe&#8208;catalyst, and an internal base for the carboxylic acid deprotonation. The obtained TEMPO adducts represent versatile synthetic intermediates that were further engaged in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions using commercial organo&#8208;photocatalysts and nucleophilic reagents.

         <dc:description>
Monitoring nutrient uptake in cells has been very difficult to date due to fluorophore artefacts. In their Research Article (e202401733), Sander&#8197;I. van&#8197;Kasteren et&#8197;al. report a new way of monitoring nutrient uptake. They developed a CFSE&#8208;based dual&#8208;quenched probe that becomes fluorogenic in the cytosol, and fluorescent when it reacts with incumbent nutrients labelled with click&#8208;reactive nutrients. The cover image was made by Dr. Kim Wals of KW Science Art using glass beads, embroidery silks and felt, with each individually knotted bead representative of a cellular component or molecular mechanism from the highlighted paper.

         <title>Inside Cover: Modulating the Electrolyte Microenvironment in Electrical Double Layer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 32/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally regulating the electrolyte microenvironment is an effective approach to boost the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance. In their Research Article (e202408382), Xin&#8208;Yao Yu and co&#8208;workers propose a novel strategy to enhance the NO3RR performance by mediating alkali metal cations in the electrolyte. In the presence of K+, the protons are more favorable to cross the electric double layer to reach the catalyst surface and conversion of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; is promoted, thereby favoring the overall kinetics of NO3RR.

The neighbouring synergy in high&#8208;density Ir single atoms for alkaline electrocatalytic oxygen evolution is described by Chuanyi Jia, Zhirong Zhang, and Jun Bao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404418). The neighbouring Ir single atoms stabilize the *OOH intermediates via additional hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring Ir single atoms offers guidance for developing efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ultrastrong Graphene Sheets Assembled with Nanoconfined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wet chemical strategies make it difficult to suppress capillary contraction and achieve orderly assembly of isotropic sheets. Cheng, Baughman, and co&#8208;workers have now used a nanoconfined water&#8208;induced alignment strategy to avoid capillary contraction, and obtained ultrastrong isotropic graphene sheets with a tensile strength of 1.87&#8197;GPa and porosity of 3.87&#8201;%.







Abstract
Highly ordered assembly of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanoplatelets plays a key role in enhancing the mechanical properties of layered nanocomposites. Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly, vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration, and blade coating have been used to fabricate layered nanocomposites. However, the intrinsic wrinkles of 2D nanoplatelets and defects derived from assembling approaches make it difficult to align 2D nanoplatelets. Recently, the team of Prof. Qunfeng Cheng at Beihang University and their collaborator, Prof. Ray H. Baughman at the University of Texas at Dallas developed a novel approach for aligning graphene and Ti3C2Tx MXene nanoplatelets by nanoconfined assembly through continuous vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration. The resultant MXene&#8208;bridged sheet has ultrastrong mechanical properties and low porosity, providing a new concept for assembling 2D nanoplatelets into aligned and compact high&#8208;performance layered nanocomposites.

         <title>Building Functional Liquid&#8208;Based Interfaces: From Mechanism to Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview explores functional liquid&#8208;based interfaces, which are notable for using the distinctive properties of liquids in various applications. It focuses on examining the structural dynamics and customizable properties of these interfaces. Additionally, the review discusses the interactions of molecular forces, design methodologies, and key application areas that warrant further attention. The ultimate aim is to advance the development of innovative systems using liquid&#8208;based interfaces.







Abstract
Functional liquid&#8208;based interfaces, with their inhomogeneous regions that emphasize the functionalized liquids, have attracted much interest as a versatile platform for a broad spectrum of applications, from chemical manufacturing to practical uses. These interfaces leverage the physicochemical characteristics of liquids, alongside dynamic behaviors induced by macroscopic wettability and microscopic molecular exchange balance, to allow for tailored properties within their functional structures. In this Minireview, we provide a foundational overview of these functional interfaces, based on the structural investigations and molecular mechanisms of interaction forces that directly modulate functionalities. Then, we discuss design strategies that have been employed in recent applications, and the crucial aspects that require focus. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in functional liquid&#8208;based interfaces and provide a perspective on future research directions.

         <title>From Plastic Waste to Green Hydrogen and Valuable Chemicals Using Sunlight and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental procedure generally involves two distinct processes: (1) pre&#8208;treatment of original plastics; and (2) photoreforming of these treated molecules. The initial stage is essential for the breakdown of long carbon chains into smaller components via pulverization and monomerization, while the subsequent stage focuses on transforming these components into economically valuable products through photoreforming. Plastic photoreforming employs a photocatalyst, typically a semiconductor, that absorbs sunlight and initiating chemical reactions. This approach has the capacity to convert plastic waste into high&#8208;value chemicals and generate hydrogen (H2) through water splitting under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Over 79&#8201;% of 6.3 billion tonnes of plastics produced from 1950 to 2015 have been disposed in landfills or found their way to the oceans, where they will reside for up to hundreds of years before being decomposed bringing upon significant dangers to our health and ecosystems. Plastic photoreforming offers an appealing alternative by using solar energy and water to transform plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemical commodities, while simultaneously producing green hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review aims to provide an overview of the underlying principles of emerging plastic photoreforming technologies, highlight the challenges associated with experimental protocols and performance assessments, discuss recent global breakthroughs on the photoreforming of plastics, and propose perspectives for future research. A critical assessment of current plastic photoreforming studies shows a lack of standardised conditions, hindering comparison amongst photocatalyst performance. Guidelines to establish a more accurate evaluation of materials and systems are proposed, with the aim to facilitate the translation of promising fundamental discovery in photocatalysts design.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Functionalization of Cyclopropenes via Cyclopropenium Cation Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes. Starting from cyclopropenyl redox&#8208;active esters, easily accessible through the rhodium&#8208; or silver&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropenation of alkynes, we could access a wide range of diverse cyclopropenes under mild photoredox conditions. The transformation displayed a broad scope and a remarkable functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies supported aromatic cyclopropenium cations as reaction intermediates.







Abstract
A photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes is reported. Starting from a broad range of redox&#8208;active ester&#8208;substituted cyclopropenes, cyclopropenylphthalimides can be synthesized in the absence of a nucleophile. Alternatively, different carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles can be introduced. The transformation proceeds most probably through the formation of an aromatic cyclopropenium cation, followed by trapping with the nucleophiles.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Ring Opening with Vinylbenzofurans Enabled by Triazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;O scission enabled annulations of 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans through a versatile C&#8722;H/C&#8722;O/N&#8722;H functionalization cascade. This reaction was achieved using a peptide&#8208;isosteric triazole and an inexpensive, non&#8208;toxic iron catalyst.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation using readily available 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans as the reaction pattern. The redox&#8208;neutral strategy, based on cheap, non&#8208;toxic, and earth&#8208;abundant iron catalysts, exploits triazole assistance to promote a cascade C&#8722;H alkylation, benzofuran ring&#8208;opening and insertion into a Fe&#8722;N bond, to form highly functionalized isoquinolones. Detailed mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations fully disclosed the manifold of the iron catalysis.

Abstract
The formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries is achieved. The two&#8208;electron reduction products feature a unique P42&#8722; structure and can act as a source of P3&#8722;. The treatment of these phosphorus containing products with electrophiles under mild conditions results in the formation of different phosphines. This approach eliminates the need for high temperatures and/or high pressures, which are commonly required in industrial processes for the preparation of useful phosphines.The activation and further functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) by main group complexes has become an increasingly studied topic in recent times. Herein, we report the controlled formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries from the selective reaction of P4 with dialumenes, ([L(IiPr)Al]2) (1: L=Tripp=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2; 2: L=tBu2MeSi; IiPr=[MeCN(iPr)]2C)). The two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction product of P4 features a P42&#8722; structure and is shown to be able to act as a source of P3&#8722;. Treatments of different electrophiles (e.g., chlorotrimethylsilane (Me3SiCl), iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI), HCl, or acetyl chloride (CH3COCl)) with these alanes under mild conditions gave the corresponding phosphines (e.g., P(SiMe3)3, PH3, or P(COCH3)3).

         <title>Photoinduced Low&#8208;Valent Zirconium Catalysis for Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced zirconocene catalysis was utilized to achieve the reductive coupling of ethers with remarkable activity and cross&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic investigation revealed that photoexcitation of low&#8208;valent zirconocene facilitates the scission of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds, resulting in benzylic radicals that recombine with Zr center. Subsequent carbomagnesiation generates benzylic Grignard reagents for downstream coupling with aliphatic ethers.







Abstract
Accessing versatile C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond through the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two distinct etheric C&#8722;O bonds is crucial in organic synthesis but remains barely explored. Herein, we report an innovative photoinduced low&#8208;valent zirconocene catalysis enabling the reductive coupling of ethers with high activity and cross&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic investigation suggests that photoexcitation of low&#8208;valent zirconocene facilitates the C(sp3)&#8722;O bond scission of benzylic ethers, leading to the benzylic radicals intermediate via a single&#8208;electron reduction pathway. The subsequent recombination of this benzylic radical with the Zr center followed by carbomagnesiation generates benzylic Grignard reagents for downstream coupling with aliphatic ethers through an SN2&#8208;like mechanism. In application, a wide range of ethers readily in situ derived from aldehydes and ketones becomes feasible with high functional group compatibility as well as excellent cross&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Bicyclobutanes with Ynamides for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes</title>

A Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with ynamides was developed, enabling access to a variety of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. The prepared products serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of novel and functionally diverse bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, showcasing their potential utility in other fields.







Abstract
Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has gained significant attention in drug discovery due to their potential to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Here, we present a mild and scalable Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with ynamides, yielding a diverse array of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. These products offer valuable starting materials for the construction of novel functionalized bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of ynamides to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, followed by an intramolecular cyclization of in situ generated enolate and keteniminium ion. We expect that these findings will encourage utilization of complex bioisosteres and foster further investigation into BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.

         <title>Trigonal Planar [PN3]4&#8722; Anion in the Nitridophosphate Oxide Ba3[PN3]O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present Ba3[PN3]O, containing the first [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Starting from commercial availably starting materials, we successfully synthesized this compound by a medium pressure reaction using the hot isostatic press. The crystal structure was elucidated by combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, SEM&#8208;EDX, LCC and MAS NMR, whereby the unambiguous assignment of O/N was verified successfully.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates, with their primary structural motif of isolated or condensed PN4 tetrahedra, meet many requirements for high performance materials. Their properties are associated with their structural diversity, which is mainly limited by this specific building block. Herein, we present the alkaline earth metal nitridophosphate oxide Ba3[PN3]O featuring a trigonal planar [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Ba3[PN3]O was obtained using a hot isostatic press by medium&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (MP/HT) at 200&#8197;MPa and 880&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data in space group R

         <title>Inhibiting Dissolution of Active Sites in 80&#8201;&#176;C Alkaline Water Electrolysis by Oxyanion Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80&#8201;&#176;C to minimize power consumption. But NiFe&#8208;based catalysts encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. In this work, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolytes. At industrial required 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 80&#8201;&#176;C, the oxyanion engineering inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides active sites to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the degradation rate by 25&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Commercial alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80&#8201;&#176;C to minimize energy consumption. However, NiFe&#8208;based catalysts, considered as one of the most promising candidates for anode, encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. Herein, we discover that the dissolution of NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during operation not only leads to degradation of anode itself, but also deactivates cathode for water splitting, resulting in decay of overall electrocatalytic performance. Aiming to suppress the dissolution, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolyte. The added phosphates to the electrolyte inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;LDH active sites at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the rate of performance decay by 25&#8208;fold. Furthermore, the usage of borates, sulfates, and carbonates yields similar results, demonstrating the reliability and universality of the active site dissolution inhibitor, and its role in elevated water electrolysis.

         <title>Synergy of Photogenerated Electrons and Holes toward Efficient Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a catalyst consisting of WO3 and Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;decorated CdS, the N2 is converted into NO species by &#8901;OH radicals generated from photogenerated holes, meanwhile the CO2 is transformed into *CO species by photogenerated electrons. The generated NO and *CO species are further coupled and gradually transformed into urea.

Directly coupling N2 and CO2 to synthesize urea by photocatalysis paves a sustainable route for urea synthesis, but its performance is limited by the competition of photogenerated electrons between N2 and CO2, as well as the underutilized photogenerated holes. Herein, we report an efficient urea synthesis process involving photogenerated electrons and holes in respectively converting CO2 and N2 over a redox heterojunction consisting of WO3 and Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;decorated CdS (Ni1&#8208;CdS/WO3). For the photocatalytic urea synthesis from N2 and CO2 in pure water, Ni1&#8208;CdS/WO3 attained a urea yield rate of 78&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 0.15&#8201;% at 385&#8197;nm, which ranked among the best photocatalytic urea synthesis performance reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that the N2 was converted into NO species by &#8901;OH radicals generated from photogenerated holes over the WO3 component, meanwhile, the CO2 was transformed into *CO species over the Ni site by photogenerated electrons. The generated NO and *CO species were further coupled to form *OCNO intermediate, then gradually transformed into urea. This work emphasizes the importance of reasonably utilizing photogenerated holes in photocatalytic reduction reactions.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Hydrogenation in Concentrated Seawater at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 32, August 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cation of concentrated seawater was demonstrated to promote C2H2 hydrogenation to C2H4. Benefiting from this, FE of C2H4 is higher than 97&#8201;% at 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in concentrated seawater. An integrated system was designed for C2H4 and H2 production from C2H2 and seawater.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene (E&#8208;AHE) is a promising alternative for thermal&#8208;catalytic process, yet it suffers from low current densities and efficiency. Here, we achieved a 71.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of E&#8208;AHE at a large partial current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using concentrated seawater as an electrolyte, which can be recycled from the brine waste (0.96&#8197;M NaCl) of alkaline seawater electrolysis (ASE). Mechanistic studies unveiled that cation of concentrated seawater dynamically prompted unsaturated interfacial water dissociation to provide protons for enhanced E&#8208;AHE. As a result, compared with freshwater, a twofold increase of FE of E&#8208;AHE was achieved on concentrated seawater&#8208;based electrolysis. We also demonstrated an integrated system of ASE and E&#8208;AHE for hydrogen and ethylene production, in which the obtained brine output from ASE was directly fed into E&#8208;AHE process without any further treatment for continuously cyclic operations. This innovative system delivered outstanding FE and selectivity of ethylene surpassed 97.0&#8201;% and 97.5&#8201;% across wide&#8208;industrial current density range (&#8804; 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively. This work provides a significant advance of electrocatalytic ethylene production coupling with brine refining of seawater electrolysis.
