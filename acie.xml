      <title>Chemical Synthesis Elucidates the Key Antigenic Epitope of the Autism&#8208;related Bacterium Clostridium bolteae Capsular Octadecasaccharide</title>
      <dc:description>The gut pathogen  Clostridium bolteae  has been associated with the onset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To create vaccines against  C. bolteae  , it is important to identify exact protective epitopes of the immunologically active capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Here, we prepared a series of  C. bolteae  CPS glycans up to an octadecasaccharide. Key to achieving the total syntheses is a [2+2] coupling strategy based on a &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Man  p  repeating unit that in turn was accessed via a stereoselective &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;rhamnosylation. The 4,6&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzylidene&#8208;induced conformational locking is a powerful strategy for forming &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;type glycoside. An indirect strategy based on the C2 epimerization of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;quinovoside was efficiently achieved by Swern oxidation and borohydride reduction. Sequential glycosylation, regioselective and global deprotection produced disaccharide, tetrasaccharide, all the way to octadecasaccharide. Glycan microarrays analysis of sera from rabbits immunized with inactivated  C. bolteae  bacteria revealed a humoral immune response to di&#8208; and tetrasaccharide but none of the longer sequences. Tetrasaccharide may be a key motif for designing glycoconjugate vaccines against  C. bolteae  .</dc:description>

Herein, we describe novel Fenton&#8208;based nanotheranostics NQ&#8208;Cy@Fe&amp;GOD for spatio&#8208;temporally reporting intratumor &#8226;OH&#8208;mediated treatment, which innovatively unites dual&#8208;channel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals.

NQ&#8208;Cy@Fe&amp;GOD can successfully monitor the intracellular release of IONPs and &#8226;OH&#8208;induced NQO1 enzyme in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, which makes a breakthrough in conquering the inherent unpredictable obstacles on spatio&#8208;temporally reporting chemodynamic therapy, so as to manipulate dose&#8208;dependent therapeutic process. This unprecedented strategy can elaborately bridge MRI and fluorescence imaging modality with spatio&#8208;temporal resolution, and paves a new pathway for accurately evaluating  in situ  generation of &#8226;OH feedback on the intratumoral catalytic Fenton reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Oxygenation through Transition Metal Acylnitrenoids</title>
      <dc:description>This study demonstrates for the first time that easily accessible transition metal acylnitrenoids can be used for controlled direct C(sp  3  )&#8208;H oxygenations. Specifically, a ruthenium catalyst activates N&#8208;benzoyloxycarbamates as nitrene precursors towards regioselective intramolecular C&#8208;H oxygenations to provide cyclic carbonates, hydroxylated carbamates, or 1,2&#8208;diols. The method can be applied to the chemoselective C&#8208;H oxygenation of benzylic, allylic, and propargylic C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds. The reaction can be performed in an enantioselective fashion and switched in a catalyst&#8208;controlled fashion between C&#8208;H oxygenation and C&#8208;H amination. This work provides a new reaction mode for the regiocontrolled and stereocontrolled conversion of C(sp  3  )&#8208;H into C(sp  3  )&#8208;O bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantification of the Magnetic Anisotropy of a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet from the Experimental Electron Density</title>
      <dc:description>We report an entirely new application of the experimental electron density (EED) in the study of magnetic anisotropy of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Among those SMMs based on one single transition metal, tetrahedral Co(II)&#8208;complexes are prominent, and their large zero&#8208;field splitting arises exclusively from coupling between the dx2&#8208;y2 and dxy orbitals. Using very low temperature single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data, we obtained an accurate electron density (ED) for a prototypical SMM, and we have used the experimental d&#8208;orbital populations to quantify the dxy&#8208;dx2&#8208;y2 coupling, which simultaneously provides us with the composition of the ground state Kramers doublet wave function. Based on this experimentally determined wave function, we calculate an energy barrier for magnetic relaxation in the range 193&#8208;268 cm&#8208;1, which is in full accordance with the previously published value of 230 cm&#8208;1 obtained from near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. These results provide the first clear and direct link between ED and molecular magnetic properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic Properties of Titanium&#8208;Porphyrinic Aerogels</title>
      <dc:description>Highly porous Ti(IV)&#8208;based materials containing photosensitizers have attract ed significant attention because of their high photocatalytic activity. Herein, we present novel Titanium&#8208;porphyrinic gels (TPGs) and Titanium&#8208;porphyrinic aerogels (TPAs), in which a porphyrinic ligand, tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin, is coordinated to Ti&#8208;oxo clusters. These hierarchically porous TPAs, with micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macropores and reactant&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface areas of 407&#8211;738 m&#173; 2  g &#8722; 1  , are prepared by CO 2  critical point drying of TPGs. Although the Ti 4+  &#8594; Ti 3+  photoreduction of TPAs is less efficient than that of a crystalline microporous Ti&#8208;porphyrinic framework (DGIST&#8208;1), prompt diffusion of O 2  and spin&#8208;trapping agents into the TPA pores causes the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen ( 1  O 2  ) and superoxide (O 2  &#8226; &#8722;  ), as observed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. When used as an ROS scavenger, large 1,3&#8208;diphenylisobenzofuran is degraded by the best&#8208;performing TPA 10 times faster than by DGIST&#8208;1, suggesting that the accessibility of molecules (reactants) to pores (reactive centers) strongly influences photocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Promotion of Catalytic Reactions by Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <dc:description>Surface acoustic waves (SAW) allow to manipulate surfaces with potential applications in catalysis, sensor and nanotechnology. SAWs were shown to cause a strong increase in catalytic activity and selectivity in many oxidation and decomposition reactions on metallic and oxidic catalysts. However, the promotion mechanism has not been unambiguously identified. Using stroboscopic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectro&#8208;microscopy we were able to evidence a sub&#8208;nanosecond work function change during propagation of 500 MHz SAWs on a 9 nm thick platinum film. We quantify the work function change to 455 &#181;eV. Such a small variation rules out that electronic effects due to elastic deformation (strain) play a major role in the SAW&#8208;induced promotion of catalysis. In a second set of experiments SAW&#8208;induced intermixing of a five monolayers thick Rh film on top of polycrystalline platinum was demonstrated to be due to enhanced thermal diffusion caused by an increase of the surface temperature by about 75 K when SAWs were excited. Reversible surface structural changes are suggested to be a major cause for catalytic promotion.</dc:description>

      <title>External Radiation&#8211;Induced Local Hydroxylation Enables Remote Release of Functional Molecules in Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>Radiation&#8208;cleavage chemistry that can achieve tumor&#8208;selective prodrug activation without causing unwanted side effects is of high value for clinical use yet has not been established. Here, we describe 3,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzyl carbamate (DHBC) as a masking group that can be selectively and efficiently removed by external radiation  in vitro  and  in vivo  . DHBC reacts mainly with hydroxyl radical among reactive oxygen species produced by radiation to afford hydroxylation on para/ortho positions, followed by 1,4&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;elimination to rescue the diverse functionality of the client molecule. We found that the reaction is rapid and can liberate client functional molecules under physiological conditions. This controlled release platform is compatible with living organisms, as demonstrated by the release of a rhodol fluorophore derivative (O&#8208;methylrhodol,  MeRho  ) in three cancer cell lines and mouse tumor xenografts. The combined benefits of synthetic ease, rapid kinetics, independence of penetration depth, high release yields, and structural compactness make DHBC derivatives attractive chemical caging moieties for use in radiation&#8208;perturbing chemical biology and prodrug activation  in vivo.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Insights into Small Molecule Drug Discovery for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
      <dc:description>The mainstream approach to antiviral drugs against COVID&#8208;19 is to focus on key stages of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 life cycle. The vast majority of candidates under investigation are repurposed from agents of other indications. Understanding of protein&#8208;inhibitor interactions at molecular scale will provide crucial insights for drug discovery to stop this pandemic. In this article, we summarize and analyze the most recent structural data on several viral targets with the presence of promising inhibitors for COVID&#8208;19 in the perspective of modes of action (MOA) to unravel insightful mechanistic features with atomistic resolution. The targets include spike glycoprotein and various host proteases mediating the entry of the virus into the cells, viral chymotrypsin&#8208; and papain&#8208;like proteases, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The main purpose of this review is to present detailed MOA analysis to inspire fresh ideas for both de novo drug design and optimization of known scaffolds to combat COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactivity and Lability Modulated by a Valence Electron Weaving in and out of the 25&#8208;Atom Gold Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to pursue heterogeneous catalysis or nanocatalysis at a single&#8208;electron level has been largely unsuccessful. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters with unique electronic structures provides access to currently inaccessible issues. Here we investigate the catalytic behaviours by performing the incoming and outgoing of a free valence electron of Au 6s1 on the Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters. Our studies reveal the distinct performances: Au25(SR)18&#8211; from donating an electron to neutral Au25(SR)180 loses the reactivity and Au25(SR)18+ from dislodging an electron from neutral Au25(SR)180 loses the stability. The reactivity diversity of the three Au25(SR)18 clusters stems from the different affinities with reactants and different extents of intramolecular charge migration during the reactions, which are closely associated with the valence occupancies of the clusters varied by one electron. The stability difference in the three clusters is attributed to their different equilibria established between the AuSR dissociation and polymerization influenced by one electron.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamics of Bacteriorhodopsin in the Dark&#8208;Adapted State from Solution NMR</title>
      <dc:description>To achieve efficient proton pumping in the light&#8208;driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, the protein must be tightly coupled to the retinal to rapidly convert retinal isomerization into protein structural rearrangements. Methyl group dynamics of bR embedded in lipid nanodiscs were determined in the dark&#8208;adapted state, and were found to be mostly well&#8208;ordered at the cytosolic side. Methyl groups in the M145A mutant of bR, which displays only 10% residual proton pumping activity, are less well ordered suggesting a link between side chain dynamics on the cytosolic side of the bR cavity and proton pumping activity. In addition, slow conformational exchange, attributed to low frequency motions of aromatic rings, was indirectly observed for residues on the extracellular side of the bR cavity. This may be related to reorganization of the water network. These observations provide a detailed picture of previously undescribed equilibrium dynamics on different time scales for ground&#8208;state bR.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Malacidin A by &#946;&#8208;Hydroxyaspartic Acid Ligation Mediated Cyclization and Absolute Structure Establishment</title>
      <dc:description>The development of novel antibiotics is critical to combating the growing emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens. Malacidin A is a new member of the calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic (CDAs) family with activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. Its mode of action is distinct from classical CDAs. However, the absolute structure of malacidin A has not been established. Herein, the total syntheses of malacidin A and its analogues are reported by a combination of Fmoc&#8208;based Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy aspartic acid ligation mediated peptide cyclization. The total synthesis enabled us to establish the absolute configuration of malacidin A, which is in agreement with those for natural malacidin A confirmed by advanced Marfey's analysis in our study.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of novel antibiotics is critical to combating the growing emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens. Malacidin A is a new member of the calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic (CDAs) family with activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens. Its mode of action is distinct from classical CDAs. However, the absolute structure of malacidin A has not been established. Herein, the total syntheses of malacidin A and its analogues are reported by a combination of Fmoc&#8208;based Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy aspartic acid ligation mediated peptide cyclization. The total synthesis enabled us to establish the absolute configuration of malacidin A, which is in agreement with those for natural malacidin A confirmed by advanced Marfey's analysis in our study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Molecular Ligand&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Multicomponent Nanosheet Superlattices for Compact Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by the self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticle superlattices, we report herein a general methodology that exploits long&#8208;chain molecular ligands to induce ordered assembly of colloidal nanosheets (NSs), resulting in 2D laminate superlattices with high packing density. Co&#8208;assembly of two types of NSs further enables 2D/2D heterostructured superlattices. As a proof of concept, co&#8208;assembly of Ti  3  C  2  T  x  and graphene oxide (GO) NSs followed by thermal annealing leads to MXene&#8208;rGO superlattices with tunable microstructures, which exhibit significantly higher capacitance than their filtrated counterparts, delivering an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 1443 F cm  &#8208;3  at 2 mV S  &#8208;1  . Moreover, the as&#8208;fabricated binder&#8208;free symmetric supercapacitors show a high volumetric energy density of 42.1 Wh L  &#8208;1  , which is among the best ever reported for MXene&#8208;based materials in aqueous electrolytes. This work paves the way toward rational design of 2D material&#8208;based superstructures for energy applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterochiral Self&#8208;Discrimination&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Decanuclear Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Complexes into 2D Nanostructures with Chiral Anions&#8208;Tuned Morphologies</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral self&#8208;recognition and self&#8208;discrimination are of vital importance to biological processes. In this work, 2D regular rhombic nanocrystals (  RS  &#8208;NC  ) were fabricated through heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination between chiral polynuclear gold(I)&#8208;sulfido complex enantiomers, [(  R  &#8208;BINAP)  4  Au  10  S  4  ]Cl  2  (  R  &#8208;Au  10  ) and [(  S  &#8208;BINAP)  4  Au  10  S  4  ]Cl  2  (  S  &#8208;Au  10  ), in MeOH without the need for any surfactants or templates. The monitoring of nanocrystals (NCs) formation by TEM and DLS has uncovered the self&#8208;assembly process and shape evolution of the NCs and revealed a screw&#8208;dislocation dictated spiral growth of the rhombic NCs. Upon addition of chiral anions, the morphology of the gold NCs was found to change from rhombic to strip and quasi&#8208;hexagonal nanosheets, arising from reverse and rotational layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking to give the bilayer NCs. By applying a high temperature, rhombic gold nanoisland films were obtained from the rhombic NCs.

      <title>Dual Function HKUST&#8208;1 Templating and Catalyzing Formation of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots at Mild Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g&#8208;CNQDs) are highly promising photoresponsive materials. However, synthesis of monodispersed g&#8208;CNQDs remains challenging. Here we report the dual function of MOF [Cu3BTC2] (HKUST&#8208;1) as a catalyst and template simultaneously to prepare g&#8208;CNQDs at mild conditions. Cyanamide (CA), a graphitic carbon nitride precursor, catalytically dimerized inside the MOF larger cavities at 90 oC and condensed into g&#8208;CNQDs at 120 oC in a controlled fashion. The HKUST&#8208;1 template was stable at the reaction conditions leading to uniform g&#8208;CNQDs with particle size of 2.22 &#177; 0.68 nm. The as prepared g&#8208;CNQDs showed photoluminescence emission with 3.1% quantum yield. Depending on this concept (MOF dual functionality) for catalyzing CA polycondensation (open metal sites (OMSs) effect) and controlling the produced particle size (pore templating effect) in addition to MOF tunable porosity, it is expected to produce unique g&#8208;CNQDs with controllable size, morphology, and surface functionality.</dc:description>

      <title>Bisporphyrin&#8208;Fused Pentacenes Exhibiting Abnormal High Stability</title>
      <dc:description>A series of largely  &#960;  &#8208;extended multichromophoric molecules including cross&#8208;conjugated, half cross&#8208;conjugated, conjugation&#8208;interrupted and linearly conjugated systems were synthesized and characterized. These multichromophoric molecular systems revealed interesting structural&#8208;property relationships. While the cross&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenequinone chromophores displayed broad UV&#8208;Vis absorption bands spanning from 350 nm through 650 nm, the linearly&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacene chromophores exhibited much red&#8208;shifted absorptions at 800 &#8211; 900 nm. Bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  showed rich redox chemistry with 7 and 8 observable redox states respectively. The linearly&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes (  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  ) possess much narrower HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps (1.65 and 1.42 eV redox, respectively) and higher HOMO energy levels than those of their pentacene analogues (2.23 and 2.01 eV redox, respectively), similar to those of much unstable hexacenes and heptacenes. Counterintuitively,  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  demonstrated unusual stability. An estimated half&#8208;life of &gt; 945 h was obtained for bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacene  Pen&#8208;2a, which is remarkably much longer than that of its pentacene analogue (  BPE&#8208;P,&#160;half&#8208;life, 33 h). Investigations of the abnormal stability of  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  using femtosecond transient absorption technique suggested nickel porphyrin centered photo&#8208;events leading to a short&#8208;lived intermediate charge transfer state, consequently blocking the photodegradation pathways. This charge transfer event is believed to play a major role in causing the abnormal stability of  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a. Steric effect and decreased LUMO energy level also contributed to stabilizing the bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes.</dc:description>

      <title>Construction of Organelle&#8208;like Architecture via Dynamic DNA Assembly in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Intracellular construction of artificial organelle&#8208;like architectures is an emerging paradigm for recreating cellular functions and interfering disease process. Design of controllable dynamic systems is vital for the construction of organelle&#8208;like architectures in living cells, but has proven to be remarkably difficult due to the lack of control over defined topology and topological transformation of self&#8208;assembled structures. Herein, we report a DNA based dynamic assembly system that achieves lysosomal acidic microenvironment specifically inducing topological transformation from nanoparticles to organelle&#8208;like hydrogel architecture in living cells. Designer DNA nanoparticles are constructed from double&#8208;stranded DNA with cytosine&#8208;rich stick ends (C&#8208;monomer) by a condensation process mediated with magnesium ions and are internalized into cells via lysosomal pathway. The lysosomal acidic microenvironment can activate the polymerization of linear DNA monomers, inducing transformation from nanoparticles to micro&#8208;sized organelle&#8208;like hydrogel which could further escape into cytoplasm. We show how the organelle&#8208;like hydrogel regulates the cellular behaviors: cytoskeleton is deformed, cell tentacles are significantly shortened, and cell migration is promoted. This DNA nanotechnology based dynamic system provides a new strategy to construct organelle&#8208;like architecture in living cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Truxenone&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework as All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathode with High Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been recognized as one of the ideal choices for energy storage techniques for practical applications given their safety and long&#8208;term stability. However, limited availability of electrode active materials with high capacity and long&#8208;term stability fabricated through low cost procedure remains a bottleneck. Herein, we report a truxenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;TRO) as cathode materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIBs. The high&#8208;density carbonyl groups combined with the ordered crystalline COF structure greatly facilitate lithium ion storage via reversible redox reactions. As a result, a high specific capacity of 268 mAh g  &#8208;1  , almost 97.5% of the calculated theoretical capacity was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest capacity among all COF&#8208;based cathode materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIBs reported so far. Moreover, the excellent cycling stability (99.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C rate) shown by COF&#8208;TRO suggests such truxenone&#8208;based COFs have great potential in energy storage applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Reactivity of a Heterogeneous Catalyst using N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands for C&#8208;H Activation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report in this communication the dramatic impact of the addition of N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands on the reactivity and selectivity of heterogeneous Ru catalysts in the context of C&#8208;H activation reactions. Using a simple and robust protocol, we have prepared a series of new air stable catalysts starting from commercially available Ru on carbon (Ru/C) and differently substituted NHCs. Associated with C&#8208;H deuteration processes, depending on Ru/C&#8208;NHC ratios, the chemical outcome can be controlled to a large extent. Indeed, tuning the reactivity of the Ru catalyst with NHC has allowed: i) to increase the chemoselectivity and the regioselectivity for the deuteration of alcohols in organic media; ii) to synthesize fragile pharmaceutically relevant deuterated heterocycles (azine, purine) otherwise completely reduced using unmodified commercial catalysts; iii) to discover a novel reactivity for such heterogeneous Ru catalysts: the selective C&#8208;1 deuteration of aldehydes.</dc:description>

      <title>Optical Control of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system for gene editing using photolabile crRNA</title>
      <dc:description>Currently CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 is a widely used efficient tool for gene editing. Precise control over CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system in temporal and spatial resolution is essentially important for studying gene regulation and editing. Here, we presented a novel light&#8208;controlled crRNA via coupling vitamin E and a photolabile linker at 5&#8217; terminus to inactivate CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system. The vitamin E modification did not affect ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation of Cas9/crRNA /tracrRNA complexes, but did inhibit the association of RNP with the target DNA. Upon light irradiation, vitamin E caged crRNA was successfully activated to achieve light&#8208;induced genome editing of Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor A (VEGFA) in human cells through T7E1 assay and Sanger sequencing as well as gene knockdown of EGFP expression in EGFP stably expressing cells. This new caging strategy for crRNA is readily achievable and will possibly provide new methods for spatiotemporal photoregulation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 mediated gene editing.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts from Multivariate MOFs for Highly Selective Reduction of CO2 at Low Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are of great interest due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the lack of general synthetic protocol makes it difficult in the construction of model SACs to discern activity difference of diverse single&#8208;atom metal species. Herein, a universal synthetic strategy towards single&#8208;atom metal implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (M1&#8208;N&#8208;C; M = Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) has been developed based on multivariate MOFs. The M1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, featuring identical parameters in chemical environment and support, provide an ideal platform to identify the differentiated activity of single&#8208;atom metal species. Upon being employed toward electrocatalytic CO2  reduction, Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C exhibits a very high CO faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 96.8%, far surpassing Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based M1&#8208;N&#8208;C. Remarkably, the best&#8208;performed Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C even possesses excellent CO FE at low CO2  pressures, which is more challenging, demonstrating a promising opportunity for the direct use of dilute CO2  feedstock.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Cooperative Photoswitching in Dihydropyrene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>We present a strategy to achieve highly cooperative photoswitching, where the initial switching event greatly facilitates subsequent switching of the neighboring unit. By linking donor/acceptor substituted dihydropyrenes via suitable&#160;p&#8208;conjugated bridges, the quantum yield for the second photochemical ring&#8208;opening process could be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude as compared to the first ring&#8208;opening. As a result, the intermediate mixed switching state is not detected during photoisomerization although it is formed during the thermal back reaction. Comparing the switching behavior of various dimers, both experimentally and computationally, helped to unravel the crucial role of the bridging moiety connecting both photochromic units. The presented dihydropyrene dimer serves as model system for longer cooperative switching chains, which, in principle, should enable efficient and directional transfer of information along a defined path. Moreover, our concept allows to enhance the photosensitivity in oligomeric and polymeric systems and materials thereof.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical side reactions, often referred to as &#8220;electrode fouling&#8221;, are known to be a major challenge in electro&#8208;organic synthesis and the functionality of modern batteries.

      <title>Idiosyncratic Ag7Pt2O7, an Electron Imprecise yet Diamagnetic, Small Band Gap Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>The seminal qualitative concepts of chemical bonding, as presented by Walter Kossel and Gilbert Newton Lewis back in 1916, have proven to be of lasting general validity. Even nowadays, these basic rules of chemical valence still serve as a touchstone for validating the plausibility of composition and constitution of a given chemical compound. Here, we report on Ag  7  Pt  2  O  7  , the composition of which violates the basic rules of chemical valence and displays an exotic crystal structure. The first coordination sphere of platinum is characteristic of tetravalent platinum. Thus, the electron count corresponds to Ag  7  Pt  2  O  7  *e  &#8208;  , where excess electrons are associated with the silver sub&#8208;structure. For such a scenario, one would expect that the excess electrons are either itinerant or localized forming Ag&#8211;Ag bonds. Neither of these assumptions complies with the experiment. The material does not show metallic conductivity, nor does the structure feature Ag&#8211;Ag pairs. Instead, indications have been obtained that the excess electrons organize themselves in 2e &#8211; 4c bonds within the silver sub&#8208;structure. This finding of a subvalent silver oxide, taken together with singular previous similar reports, is suited to reveal a new general facet pertinent to the chemistry of silver.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thin zeolitic nanosheets have emerged as fascinating materials for catalysis and separation. The controllability of nanosheets stacking is extremely challenging in the chemistry of two&#8208;dimensional zeolitic materials. So far, the organization of zeolitic nanosheets in hydrothermal synthesis has been limited by the lack of tunable control over the guest&#8208;host interactions between organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) and zeolitic nanosheets. Here, we report a direct synthetic methodology that enables systematic manipulation of the aluminosilicate MWW&#8208;type nanosheets stacking. Variable control of guest&#8208;host interactions is rationally achieved by synergistically altering the charge density of OSDAs and synthetic silica&#8208;to&#8208;alumina composition. These finely&#8208;controlled interactions allow the successful preparation of series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) zeolites with MWW&#8208;layer stacking in wide ranges from variations of disorder to fully&#8208;order, leading to tunable catalytic activity in cracking reaction. These results highlight unprecedented opportunities to modulate zeolitic nanosheets arrangement in 3D zeolites whose structure can be tailored for catalysis and separation.</dc:description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Synthesis of Chiral Zeolites: A Rational Strategy for Fluoride&#8208;Free Synthesis of STW&#8208;Type Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>The STW&#8208;type zeolite is significantly attractive for developing novel enantioselective syntheses/separation of chiral compounds because it is the only chiral zeolitic microporous material whose enantioenriched synthesis has been achieved. Besides the conventional industries where zeolites are used, STW should have diverse industrial applications such as in the pharmaceutical and food industries. However, the toxic and caustic fluoride required for synthesizing STW severely hinders its commercialization by mass production. Here, we report the first example of fluoride&#8208;free STW synthesis, where the two roles of fluoride&#8212;formation of a zeolitic framework rich in tetravalent T&#8208;atoms and promotion of double 4&#8208;membered ring unit formation&#8212;were substituted by dry gel conversion and Ge addition, respectively. The obtained STW was highly crystalline, with a similar micropore volume and thermal stability as those of original fluoride&#8208;based STW. Our approach is promising not only for the fluoride&#8208;free synthesis of enantiomeric STW but also for general fluoride&#8208;free syntheses.</dc:description>

      <title>Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water by Macrocycle&#8208;Containing Covalent Polymer Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Access to clean drinking water is a recognized societal need that touches on the health and livelihood of millions of people worldwide. This is providing an incentive to develop new water&#8208;treatment technologies. Traditional technologies, while widespread, are usually inefficient at removing organic pollutants from sewage or so&#8208;called grey water. Macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks have begun to attract attention in the context of water treatment owing to the inherent stability provided by the polymer backbones and their ability to capture micropollutant guests as the result of tunable macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances (from 2016 to mid&#8208;2020) involving the removal of organic micropollutants from water using macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks. An overview of future challenges within this subfield is also provided.</dc:description>

      <title>Ammonia oxidation enhanced by photopotential generated by plasmonic excitation of a bimetallic electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>We study how visible light influences the activity of an electrocatalyst composed of Au and Pt nanoparticles. The bimetallic composition imparts a dual functionality: the Pt component catalyses the electrochemical oxidation of ammonia to liberate hydrogen and the Au component absorbs visible light by the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances. Under visible&#8208;light excitation, this catalyst exhibits enhanced electrochemical ammonia oxidation kinetics, outperforming previously reported electrochemical schemes. We trace the enhancement to a photochemical potential resulting from electron&#8211;hole carriers generated in the electrocatalyst by plasmonic excitation. The photopotential responsible for enhanced kinetics scales linearly with the light intensity&#8211;a general design principle for eliciting superlative photoelectrochemical performance from catalysts comprised of plasmonic metals or hybrids.

      <title>Suppressing Interfacial Charge Recombination in Electron Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 21%</title>
      <dc:description>The performances of reported electron transport layer (ETL)&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still inferior to ETL&#8208;containing devices. This is mainly due to severe interfacial charge recombination occurred at the transparent conducting oxide (TCO)/perovskite interface, where the photo&#8208;injected electrons in the TCO can travel back to recombine with holes in the perovskite layer. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate that a non&#8208;annealed, insulating, amorphous metal oxyhydroxide, atomic&#8208;scale thin interlayer (~3 nm) between the TCO and perovskite facilitates electron tunnelling and suppresses the interfacial charge recombination. This largely reduced the interfacial charge recombination loss and achieved a record efficiency of 21.1% for  n&#8208;i&#8208;p  structured ETL&#8208;free PSCs, outperforming their ETL&#8208;containing metal oxide counterparts (18.7%), as well as narrowing the efficiency gap with high&#8208;efficiency PSCs employing highly crystalline TiO  2  ETLs.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface Reconstruction of Ultrathin Palladium Nanosheets during Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>A surface reconstructing phenomenon is discovered on a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin Pd nanosheets catalyst for aqueous CO2 electroreduction. The pristine nanosheets with dominant (111) facet sites are transformed into crumpled sheet&#8208;like structures prevalent in electrocatalytically active (100) sites. The reconstruction increases the density of active sites and reduces the CO binding strength on Pd surfaces, remarkably promoting the CO2 reduction to CO.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A surface reconstructing phenomenon is discovered on a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin Pd nanosheets catalyst for aqueous CO2 electroreduction. The pristine nanosheets with dominant (111) facet sites are transformed into crumpled sheet&#8208;like structures prevalent in electrocatalytically active (100) sites. The reconstruction increases the density of active sites and reduces the CO binding strength on Pd surfaces, remarkably promoting the CO2 reduction to CO. A high CO faradaic efficiency of 93% is achieved with a site&#8208;specific activity of 6.6 mA cm&#8208;2 at a moderate overpotential of 590 mV on reconstructed 50 nm Pd nanosheets. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest the CO intermediate as a key factor driving the structural transformation during CO2 reduction. This study highlights the dynamic nature of defective metal nanosheets under reaction conditions and suggests new opportunities in surface engineering of 2D metal nanostructures to tune their electrocatalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Negative pressure pyrolysis induced highly accessible single sites dispersed on 3D graphene frameworks for enhanced oxygen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>The surface structure of supports is related to the properties of catalytic sites and their spatial structure also plays a dominant role in the mass transfer during catalysis process. Herein, we report a negative pressure pyrolysis to access dense single metal sites (Co, Fe, Ni etc.) with high accessibility dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) graphene frameworks (GFs), during which the differential pressure between inside and outside of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) promotes the cleavage of the derived&#8208;carbon layers and gradual expansion of mesopores. In situ transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller tests reveal the formed 3D GFs possess an enhanced mesoporosity and external surface area, which greatly favor the mass transport and utilization of metal sites. This contributes to an excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.901 V vs. RHE). Theoretical calculations verify that selective carbon cleavage near Co centers can efficiently lower the overall ORR theoretical overpotential in comparison with intact atomic configuration. This work discovers the structure&#8208;property correlations that provides an idea of designing highly accessible catalysts for practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual&#8208;Emissive Pt(II) Metallacage with Sensitive Oxygen Response for Imaging of Hypoxia and Imaging&#8208;Guided Chemotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Imaging of hypoxia  in vivo  helps with accurate cancer diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic outcomes. Here we report a Pt(II) metallacage with oxygen&#8208;responsive red phosphorescence and steady fluorescence for  in vivo  hypoxia imaging and chemotherapy. Intriguingly, the therapeutic agent and diagnostic probe are sophisticatedly integrated into the metallacage through heteroligation&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly. Nanoformulation by encapsulating the metallacage into nanoparticles greatly enhance its stability in physiological environment, making the biomedical applications feasible. Apart from the enhanced red phosphorescence upon hypoxia, the ratio between red and blue emissions, which only varies with intracellular oxygen level, provides a more precise standard for hypoxia imaging and detection. Moreover,  in vivo  explorations demonstrate the promising potential applications of the metallacage&#8208;loaded nanoparticles as theranostic agents for tumor hypoxia imaging and chemotherapy.</dc:description>
