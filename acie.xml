         <title>Localizing the Long&#8208;Range Disorder of Reconstructed Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;range disorder of dynamically reconstructed Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions is finely localized by fluoride&#8208;mediated stabilization of lattice Co sites during reconstruction. The localized long&#8208;range disorder efficiently promotes Co&#9472;O covalency and induces tensile strain, leading to balanced activation and regeneration of lattice oxygen for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE).








Abstract
Controlling the long&#8208;range disorder of dynamically reconstructed nanostructures represents a challenging but important approach for achieving practical catalysts with high performance. Here, we report a facile fluoride&#8208;mediated&#8208;stabilization strategy to finely localize the long&#8208;range disorder of reconstructed amorphous Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions with compatible lattice&#8208;oxygen activation and regeneration for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). The stabilized lattice Co by fluoride&#8208;induced bond reinforcing in pre&#8208;catalysts enabled localized long&#8208;range disorder of reconstructed amorphous oxyhydroxides. The localized long&#8208;range disorder can promote Co&#9472;O covalency for activating lattice oxygen and also induce tensile strain as an oxygen pump for regenerating lattice oxygen. The corresponding AEMWE yielded a cutting&#8208;edge current of 3.4 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V and remarkable stability with imperceptible degradation of 0.09&#160;mV h&#8722;1 in 1200&#160;h. This work opens up a feasible avenue for developing targeted catalysts under operating conditions by finely tuning the long&#8208;range disorder during reconstruction.

         <title>Emerging Nitroso/Hydroxylamine Redox Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Organic Cathodes in Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#9552;O/NHOH redox chemistry, inspired by biological processes, enables proton&#8208;coupled two&#8208;electron storage with high voltage and fast kinetics, providing a blueprint for high&#8208;capacity organic cathode materials for aqueous proton batteries.








Abstract
Organic cathode materials are emerging candidates for aqueous proton batteries due to their structural tunability and sustainability. However, the simultaneous realization of high voltage, low solubility, and high capacity remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce a biomimetic redox pair, nitroso/hydroxylamine (&#9472;N&#9552;O &#8652; &#9472;NH&#9472;OH), for the first time in energy storage systems. We report 1&#8208;(hydroxyamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (NHOH&#8208;A), a rationally designed aromatic hydroxylamine compound capable of undergoing a highly reversible proton&#8208;coupled two&#8208;electron redox process. Benefiting from its strong hydrogen bonding, uniform charge distribution, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, NHOH&#8208;A delivers a high discharge voltage of 1.15&#160;V, excellent capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1, and remarkable cyclability (&gt; 13,000 cycles) when coupled with a Zn anode. Furthermore, leveraging its intrinsic proton&#8208;donating capability, we construct a rocking&#8208;chair type all&#8208;organic proton battery by pairing NHOH&#8208;A with an alloxazine anode. The full cell maintains 164 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C (1 C = 224&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and delivers an energy density of 125&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, among the highest for all&#8208;organic proton batteries. This work establishes the N&#9552;O/NHOH chemistry as a promising redox platform, opening new avenues for developing advanced organic cathodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Quantum Interference Effect in Saturated Systems: Effect of Anchoring Group Position on Conductance of Bipiperidines and their in&#8208;situ Derived Dithiocarbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates distinct quantum interference effect in saturated systems as compared to their unsaturated counterparts and the origin of multiple conductance features observed in single molecule conductance experiments of different isomers of bipiperdine and their in&#8208;situ generated dithiocarbamates.








Abstract
This study investigates quantum interference in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems, focusing on the impact of anchoring group nature and its position. Using a combined approach of mechanically controlled break junction experiments and quantum transport calculations, we demonstrate that meta&#8208;connected &#963;&#8208;conducting bipiperidine&#8208;based molecular junctions exhibit higher conductance than para&#8208;connected ones. This trend is opposite to that of the trend typically observed in &#960;&#8208;molecular systems, indicating the existence of distinctly different quantum interference phenomenon in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems. Further, we show that anchoring group modifications achieved through in&#8208;situ dithiocarbamylation significantly alters the conductance and decay factors. We also elucidate the mechanism behind multiple conductance features observed in aliphatic bipiperidines with cyclic secondary amine and dithiocarbamate anchoring groups. This work demonstrates &#963;&#8208;quantum interference in bipiperidine&#8208;based molecular systems and highlights how changes in junction configuration, nature of the anchoring group and its position can be used to control conductance in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Specific Installation of Aryl Groups in RNA via DNA&#8208;Catalyst Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA oligonucleotides carrying amine nucleophilic catalysts are employed to deliver aryl groups to complementary sites in RNA under physiological conditions. The strategy can be used to sequence&#8208;specifically label protein&#8208;coding RNAs, or to knock down expression selectively, with potential applications in basic transcriptome research and in future therapies.








Abstract
Installing functional groups at specific sites in existing RNA molecules remains a challenge for modification, labeling, and therapeutic strategies. Here, we describe the use of DNA oligonucleotides carrying a catalytic amine group to effect the aqueous SNAr arylation of 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups at sequence&#8208;complementary sites in RNAs. Chloro&#8208;pyrimidine electrophiles are shown to react with amino&#8208;DNA conjugates, resulting in a proposed transient ammonium aryl intermediate that can react with RNA near the DNA binding site, delivering the heterocycle to the RNA in high yields. In a test of utility, we construct an aryl electrophile carrying an azide group, and apply this strategy to fluorescently label messenger RNAs locally at the polyA tail. We also employ the approach to direct in vitro arylation in the coding region of a messenger RNA, knocking down protein expression selectively in the presence of another coding RNA. This sequence&#8208;directed catalytic strategy enables multiple applications in RNA labeling and modification.

         <title>Reverse Modulation of Carbon&#8208;Interface Electron Density via s&#8208;d Block High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloys Boosts Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>

Remote modulation carbon's interfacial electronic properties coupling with high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys, especially with highly exotic Mg (CoNiCuMnMg@C) to unleashing carbon's potential in Li&#8211;S batteries. The CoNiCuMnMg@C/S cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity and capacity retention. This novel strategy provides new horizons for high&#8208;effective catalyst design.








Abstract
Carbon materials, renowned for their exceptional intrinsic properties, play a pivotal role in the domain of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially for encasing delicate metal&#8208;based catalysts. However, this encasement hinders the precise control of catalytic capacity because carbon's inherent &#963;&#8208;bonding complicates direct changes to the material's surface atomic and electronic structure. Herein, a universal fresh perspective is reported that remotely and precisely reverse manipulation the surface electronic structure of carbon host by driving electron pumping, accumulation, Li ion diffusion and facilitate covalent interactions with polysulfides using s&#8208;d block high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys (CoNiCuMnMg@C). Theoretical calculation optimization results confirm that polysulfides stabilize at the Carbon interface rather than directly at the alloy surface so as to avoid its being poisoned. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and KPFM results shed light on that coupling with high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys, especially with highly exotic Mg, reduces the work function and enhances the electron density signaling that an electron deviation from alloy to C (Hershfield charge of &#8722;0.34 e), which in turn enhances the electron&#8208;rich carbon's ability to strongly adsorb Li+. The CoNiCuMnMg@C catalyst boosts Li+ diffusion and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The CoNiCuMnMg@C/S cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity and capacity retention.

&lt;p&gt;Remote modulation carbon's interfacial electronic properties coupling with high-entropy-alloys, especially with highly exotic Mg (CoNiCuMnMg@C) to unleashing carbon's potential in Li&#8211;S batteries. The CoNiCuMnMg@C/S cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity and capacity retention. This novel strategy provides new horizons for high-effective catalyst design.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon materials, renowned for their exceptional intrinsic properties, play a pivotal role in the domain of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially for encasing delicate metal-based catalysts. However, this encasement hinders the precise control of catalytic capacity because carbon's inherent &#963;-bonding complicates direct changes to the material's surface atomic and electronic structure. Herein, a universal fresh perspective is reported that remotely and precisely reverse manipulation the surface electronic structure of carbon host by driving electron pumping, accumulation, Li ion diffusion and facilitate covalent interactions with polysulfides using s-d block high-entropy-alloys (CoNiCuMnMg@C). Theoretical calculation optimization results confirm that polysulfides stabilize at the Carbon interface rather than directly at the alloy surface so as to avoid its being poisoned. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and KPFM results shed light on that coupling with high-entropy-alloys, especially with highly exotic Mg, reduces the work function and enhances the electron density signaling that an electron deviation from alloy to C (Hershfield charge of &#8722;0.34 e), which in turn enhances the electron-rich carbon's ability to strongly adsorb Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The CoNiCuMnMg@C catalyst boosts Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The CoNiCuMnMg@C/S cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity and capacity retention. This novel strategy provides new horizons for high-effective catalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Tunable Copolymerization of Oxetane and Anhydrides via a Nonsymmetric Three&#8208;Center Four&#8208;Electron Iodine Activation Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen&#8208;bond catalysis platform leveraging a non&#8208;symmetric three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron iodine activation mode enables highly selective, tunable copolymerization of oxetanes with cyclic anhydrides. By dynamically controlling ester/ether linkages via halogen&#8211;carboxylate equilibria, this strategy provides programmable access to composition&#8208;defined polyesters across a broad monomer scope, establishing new design principles for functional and sustainable polymers. Details of this study are reported by Jin Huang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202510588).

FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo thermal&#8208;driven deformations and reconstructions. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy, it can undergo desolvent&#8208;driven controllable deformations, from in situ shrinkage to stepwise shrinkage.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Channel Gas&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Switch: Realizing a Reversible Fluorescent Response to HCl and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the first metal&#8211;organic frameworks integrating molecular conformation locking and coordination&#8208;induced energy transfer mechanism for fluorescent sensing of harmful gases were rationally designed and constructed. Ln&#8208;TCPE achieves a reversible fluorescent response to HCl gas through the dual channels while Ln&#8208;ETTB achieves a reversible fluorescent response to NH3 gas through the single channel. This study provides more detailed and deeper mechanistic insights into the fluorescent gas responsive process.








Abstract
Luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs) provide exceptional advantages over conventional materials in detecting harmful gases. However, challenges remain, such as limited stability, unclear fluorescence signal changes and insufficient mechanistic understanding. In this study, we developed two types of lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) exhibiting rapid (&lt;5&#160;s) and reversible fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses to vapor exposure. Specifically, Ln&#8208;TCPE demonstrates a swift response to HCl vapor via a unique dual&#8208;channel mechanism: highly dipolar HCl molecules stabilize the conformation of tetraphenylethylene ligands through weak intermolecular interactions, causing a 780% increase in fluorescence intensity. Simultaneously, HCl coordination with Ln3+ triggers a pronounced 45&#160;nm redshift in fluorescence by altering the MOFs' overall energy and electron transfer dynamics. The combination of these two signals greatly amplifies the fluorescence transition. Outstanding stability allows the sample's initial fluorescence to be fully restored through simple thermal desorption, enabling recyclability. With fewer open metal sites, Ln&#8208;ETTB achieves fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; detection of NH3 vapor solely via benzene ring locking, and it can likewise be recycled. This study presents the first report of such dual&#8208;channel gas&#8208;responsive LMOFs. We thoroughly elucidated the underlying mechanisms through experimental work and DFT calculations, paving the way for new advancements in LMOFs&#8208;based gas sensing.

         <title>Responsible Use of Kinematic Models: Correspondence on &#8220;Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry&#8221;</title>

Kinematic models offer useful estimates of maximum energy output in ball milling, provided they are applied with accurate parameters and appropriate caution of the model's assumptions and limitations.








Abstract
In their recent article, Jafter et&#160;al. present &#8220;refined&#8221; kinematic models for planetary and mixer mills. While the improvement of such models is a valuable pursuit, we find that aspects of the presentation and application of these models raise concerns. The authors modify an existing planetary mill model, yet the altered equations offer no clear advantage and obscure the underlying milling dynamics. The mixer mill model is similar to known models, but includes additional parameters, such as an empirical scaling factor, that lack theoretical justification. Furthermore, the models are applied using estimated or hypothetical values for important milling parameters, contributing to overestimations of the energy metrics. Rather than dismissing the use of kinematic models, we emphasize the importance of applying them with care by using accurate input parameters, being aware of their assumptions and limitations, and interpreting their outputs in the context of what the energy metrics represent (maximum energies released from impacts). When employed responsibly, kinematic models can provide valuable insight, and thus, we encourage a more rigorous and transparent application of these models to support the broader goal of reproducibility in mechanochemistry.

         <title>Reversing Lanmodulin's Metal&#8208;Binding Sequence in Short Peptides Surprisingly Increases the Lanthanide Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accidentally reversing the lanthanide&#8208;binding sequences of lanmodulin&#8208;inspired short peptides lead to the serendipitous discovery of a set of peptides with a one order of magnitude higher lanthanide&#8208;binding affinity than the uncapped peptides synthesised in the correct direction.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for a clean energy future, high tech, and medicine. For these applications the chemically similar elements need to be tediously separated. Recent discoveries that specific lanthanide&#8208;binding proteins such as lanmodulin (LanM) exist in nature have prompted the development of bio&#8208;inspired separation methods for REEs. Peptides hold great potential for tuning binding sites in various applications as they are easily synthesised, modifiable, and can be immobilised. Here we use the EF&#8208;hand binding site sequences of LanM, the naturally lanthanide&#8208;binding EF&#8208;hand protein from Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, as a blueprint for peptides with potential applications in REE recycling. We show with time&#8208;resolved laser&#8208;induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy the surprising result that reversing the natural sequence of LanM's metal&#8208;binding loops leads to an increased binding affinity of about one order of magnitude for three out of four natural sequences. Furthermore, we were able to identify structural features responsible for the affinity boost and were able to obtain &#8211; only by exchanging one amino acid &#8211; a linear uncapped 12&#8208;amino&#8208;acid peptide with a 150&#160;nM affinity for lanthanides.

         <title>Structural Tweaking of Zwitterionic Metallosupramolecular Assemblies for Intense NIR Emission and High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just by changing the structure from a monotopic to ditopic, the metallosupramolecular assemblies of the terpyridine appended zwitterionic squaraine derivatives, MSq and DSq exhibited distinct optoelectronic properties. The DSq zinc ion complex (DSq&#8722;Zn2+) exhibited strong NIR emission and weaker photoconductivity whereas MSq zinc ion complex (MSq&#8722;Zn2+) showed relatively weak NIR emission, but higher charge carrier mobility (2.5&#160;cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1), the highest reported for a supramolecular assembly till date. 








Abstract
Metal organic materials (MOMs) with intense NIR emission and charge transport are essential for biomedical and bioelectronic applications, particularly in devices for medical diagnostics. Metallosupramolecular assemblies guided by directional metal&#8722;ligand coordination is a viable option for creating MOMs with strong electronic communication required for targeted optical and electronic properties. Herein, we demonstrate that the zwitterionic metallosupramolecular assemblies of squaraine dyes can be structurally tweaked to exhibit exceptionally intense NIR emission on the one hand and charge carrier mobility on the other hand. We have designed a monotopic squaraine dye (MSq) and a ditopic squaraine dye (DSq) and their corresponding metallosupramolecular assemblies. Among these, the Zn2+ coordinated metallosupramolecular assemblies of DSq showed strong near infrared luminescence with a maximum at 666&#160;nm whereas the one generated with MSq exhibited a high charge carrier mobility 2.5&#160;cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 when compared to the parent squaraine dye. This value is the highest measured for a metallosupramolecular system known till date.

         <title>From Solvent to Catalyst: In Situ Amino Acid&#8208;Like Species Enable PET Upcycling Without Added Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid logic meets solvent design: A bioinspired strategy leveraging the acid&#8208;base synergistic catalysis of in situ&#8208;generated amino acid&#8211;like species from N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) enables external catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization of waste polyesters into valuable carboxylates and ethylene carbonate.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a promising route to value&#8208;added chemical production, yet conventional methods typically demand harsh conditions and dedicated catalysts. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy that exploits the intramolecular acid&#8208;base synergy of amino acids for efficient PET depolymerization. Alanine functions as a bifunctional organocatalyst, enabling complete PET esterolysis by dimethyl carbonate within 3&#160;h at 180 &#176;C to afford dimethyl terephthalate (98%) and ethylene carbonate (80%). Extending this concept, trace water in N&#8208;methyl &#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone induces in situ generation of 4&#8208;(methylamino)butyric acid, which emulates amino acid bifunctionality and enables catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an intramolecular dual&#8208;site acid&#8208;base mechanism, where &#8211;COO&#8722; and &#8211;NH2&#8314;&#160;groups cooperatively activate methanol and PET carbonyls through hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic transition states, lowering the barrier by &#8764;29&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1. The method extends broadly to polyesters and polycarbonate, while establishing a transferable design paradigm that translates catalytic principles from nature into organocatalyst and solvent design, underscoring solvent molecular design as a general lever for sustainable catalysis and plastic upcycling.

         <title>Enhancing Cascade Reaction Efficiency by Local pH Regulation for Integrated Anodic H2O2 Generation and Ammoximation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work integrates anodic H2O2 generation with ammoximation for efficient oxime synthesis. By regulating the local pH through electrolyte engineering, the system achieves 81% electron efficiency (EE) and 98% H2O2 utilization, offering a generalizable strategy for cascade electrochemical&#8211;chemical processes.








Abstract
Cascade reaction strategies integrating electrochemistry with chemical transformations offer routes for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the efficiencies of such integrated processes get compromised due to competitive electrochemical reactions and incompatibility between electrochemical and chemical transformations. We report an integrated electrochemical&#8211;chemical coupling of anodic H2O2 generation with ammoximation for oxime synthesis. An FTO/Sb2WO6 anode was designed and optimized to anodically produce H2O2 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87%. H2O2 from the anode oxidizes NH3 to NH2OH, which subsequently reacts with cyclohexanone to yield cyclohexanone oxime with 99% selectivity and a maximum electron efficiency (EE) of 81%. Continuous and adjustable H2O2 input ensures synchronization with the ammonia oxidation reaction while minimizing over&#8208;oxidation of the reaction intermediates. Operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) revealed local pH shifts caused by the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and its effect on the FE of H2O2 synthesis and competing NH3 oxidation, providing mechanistic insights for optimizing the reaction microenvironment. By regulating the electrolyte composition to modulate the interfacial pH, side reactions were suppressed and H2O2 generation was promoted, thereby enhancing cascade selectivity. This work highlights local pH regulation as a tool to improve reaction compatibility and efficiency in cascade electrosynthesis.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Ligated Boryl Radicals Enables Direct C&#9472;F Borylation and Cross&#8208;Couplings of Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synergistic strategy combining photocatalytic direct C&#9472;F borylation of polyfluoroarenes with Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. The high nucleophilicity of amine&#8208;ligated boryl radicals enables efficient homolytic aromatic substitution of polyfluoroarenes, forming stable amine&#8211;borane adducts that resist protodeboronation and can be directly used in cross&#8208;coupling to access functionalized polyfluoroarenes.








Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceutical and materials science, yet their synthesis remains challenging. Aromatic borylation offers a modular entry point for derivatization via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, but progress is hindered by two persistent issues: the difficulty of direct borylation on electron&#8208;deficient polyfluoroarenes, and the pronounced susceptibility of the resulting boron species to rapid protodeboronation under standard cross&#8208;coupling conditions. Here, we present an orthogonal strategy that addresses both limitations. Amine&#8208;ligated boryl radicals enable direct radical C&#9472;F borylation of polyfluoroarenes under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. The resulting amine&#8211;borane adducts are crystalline, bench&#8208;stable, and resistant to protodeboronation, allowing their direct use in Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. This platform provides scalable and broadly applicable access to functionalized polyfluoroarenes and overcomes some of the synthetic constraints associated with these valuable motifs.

The high nucleophilicity of amine-ligated boryl radicals enables efficient homolytic aromatic substitution of polyfluoroarenes, forming stable amine&#8211;borane adducts that resist protodeboronation and can be directly used in cross-coupling to access functionalized polyfluoroarenes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyfluoroarenes are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceutical and materials science, yet their synthesis remains challenging. Aromatic borylation offers a modular entry point for derivatization via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling, but progress is hindered by two persistent issues: the difficulty of direct borylation on electron-deficient polyfluoroarenes, and the pronounced susceptibility of the resulting boron species to rapid protodeboronation under standard cross-coupling conditions. Here, we present an orthogonal strategy that addresses both limitations. Amine-ligated boryl radicals enable direct radical C&#9472;F borylation of polyfluoroarenes under visible-light photoredox catalysis. The resulting amine&#8211;borane adducts are crystalline, bench-stable, and resistant to protodeboronation, allowing their direct use in Pd-catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-couplings. This platform provides scalable and broadly applicable access to functionalized polyfluoroarenes and overcomes some of the synthetic constraints associated with these valuable motifs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable &#960;&#8209;Extended Viologen Functionalized Hybrid Lead Halides for Near Infrared&#8208;Driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a highly stable viologen&#8208;functionalized lead iodide framework featuring strong UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR absorption extending up to 965&#160;nm, achieving record&#8208;high NIR&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 photoconversion. The intrinsic donor&#8211;acceptor architecture, combined with excellent carrier mobility in lead iodide layers, facilitates photoinduced charge separation and directs electrons toward adjacent N radical sites, effectively promoting *CO&#8211;CO coupling for selective C2 product formation.








Abstract
Hybrid lead halides show great potential for CO2 photoreduction owing to their structural tunability and excellent photophysical properties. However, their intrinsic instability and the suppressed efficiency of C&#8211;C coupling under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation highlight the significant challenges of developing a stable, single&#8208;component photocatalyst with efficient NIR utilization. Herein, we incorporate &#960;&#8208;extended viologen units into two hybrid lead halides via coordination&#8208;driven assembly, forming intrinsic donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) configurations. Dimensional modulation from 1D to 2D extends the NIR absorption to 965&#160;nm, affording a narrow bandgap of 1.28&#160;eV. The inherent D&#8211;A system, combined with excellent carrier mobility of lead halides, promotes efficient electron migration from the lead halide components to the viologen moieties, generating stable N&#8208;radical species. The resultant single&#8208;component photocatalyst achieves selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with high apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of 0.81% at 700(&#177;15)&#160;nm and 0.38% at 800(&#177;15)&#160;nm, exceeding typical NIR&#8208;responsive photocatalysts that typically generate C1 products. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the accumulated carriers enhance *CO intermediate formation on adjacent N radical sites with close proximity (&#8764;4.7&#160;&#197;), promoting *CO&#8211;CO coupling. This work presents an effective strategy for utilizing low&#8208;energy NIR light and drive CO2 conversion to high&#8208;value C2 hydrocarbons, advancing the design of high&#8208;performance metal halide photocatalysts.

         <title>Finding the Key: Binding of Metal&#8208;Oxo Clusters to the Enzyme Active Site Enabled by &#8220;Click&#8221; (Bio)Conjugation</title>

This work demonstrates targeted, site&#8208;specific binding of metal&#8208;oxo clusters to Hen Egg White Lysozyme through organic functionalization. Crystallographic analysis reveals Azide&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside&#8208;functionalized vanadate clusters accessing the enzyme's binding pocket, whereas hexyne&#8208;functionalized clusters do not promote interactions with the same site. This work demonstrates the utility of derivatizing inorganic clusters with organic moieties to facilitate targeted protein interactions.








Abstract
Molecular metal&#8208;oxo nanoclusters with tunable redox and structural properties have emerged as powerful bio&#8208;inorganic tools in catalysis, protein crystallization, and therapeutic applications. Despite their potential, interactions between discrete clusters and proteins are predominantly driven by nonspecific intermolecular interactions, which limit precise control over binding sites and functional outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new strategy to achieve site&#8208;directed binding of vanadium&#8208;based polyoxometalate clusters (POVs) to distinct regions of Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL), an archetypal antimicrobial enzyme. Three novel hybrid POVs were designed and fully characterized, starting from an azide&#8208;functionalized cluster (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;N3), which was subsequently post&#8208;functionalized with a hydrophobic hexyne group (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Hex) to probe nonpolar interactions, and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Man) to mimic the protein's natural substrate. Structural and spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that, in contrast to conventional nonhybrid POV clusters which bind nonspecifically to peripheral positively charged protein patches, the hybrid POVs achieve distinct binding behaviors. Specifically, Na&#8208;V6&#8208;N3 and Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Man selectively target the glycosidic pocket, resembling the binding of the protein's natural substrate, while Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Hex exhibits an unprecedented crystallization of two POV clusters in close proximity, which wrap around the protein surface. These findings highlight that strategic organic functionalization can circumvent electrostatic barriers to achieve site&#8208;selective cluster&#8211;protein interactions, thus opening new avenues for the application of metal&#8208;oxo clusters in biotechnology, drug delivery, and medicine.

         <title>Lower Critical Solution Temperature Active Supramolecular &#960;&#8208;Systems for Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we discuss Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) active supramolecular &#960;&#8208;systems for designing thermoresponsive smart windows, molecular thermometers, and biomedical systems. A critical analysis of such materials and their mechanistic understanding is important for future developments. This minireview outlines both the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems have emerged as an essential requirement for a wide range of smart applications in material sciences and biology. Among various responses, thermal response is a common functional characteristic of macromolecular and supramolecular systems. For example, polyacrylamides and their variants are known to exhibit a phenomenon called lower critical solution temperature (LCST) under aqueous conditions, which is a heat&#8208;induced phase change from a transparent to opaque state. Similarly, numerous amphiphilic supramolecular systems are known to exhibit LCST properties. &#960;&#8208;Conjugated molecules are emerging as preferred building blocks for the construction of LCST active supramolecular materials owing to their inherent electronic and optical properties, which are sensitive to temperature variations. A variety of amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;systems have been reported for the creation of dynamic and adaptive LCST materials, and a combined analysis of such materials is important for further developments. In this minireview, we describe how researchers have exploited the LCST property of supramolecular &#960;&#8208;systems for various smart applications, such as smart windows and nanothermometers, and discuss their future potential and challenges.

         <title>Synergic Coordination Effect in Nonflammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel sodium&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte, which is induced to form by the double synergistic action of Na&#9472;O and hydrogen bonding together, and the unique solvated structure significantly enhances the compatibility at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which leads to the excellent performance of the sodium&#8208;ion batteries. 








Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are emerging as a highly promising class of next&#8208;generation electrolytes, poised to revolutionize the performance of safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, a significant challenge hindering the progress of SIBs is the scarcity of suitable DEEs capable of harmonizing electrolyte conductivity, interfacial compatibility, and safety. In this study, we have engineered a DEE leveraging the synergistic interplay between Na&#8208;bonds and hydrogen bonds, achieved through the integration of N&#8208;methylacetamide (NMA) and sodium&#8208;difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB). The findings reveal that the distinctive interaction between the polar C&#9552;O group in NMA and Na+ ions, coupled with hydrogen bonding with DFOB&#8722; anions, facilitates the formation of the DEE. The designed DEE demonstrates exceptional ionic conductivity (4.03 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), a high oxidation voltage (4.63&#160;V versus Na+/Na), and nonflammability. The unique solvation structure markedly enhances the compatibility of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, with the NVP||Na cell exhibiting outstanding cycling performance (86.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability. Moreover, the DEEs exhibit robust performance at elevated temperatures (94.3% retention after 120 cycles with NVP||Na cell), and the full cell demonstrates significant enhancements in both cycle stability (90.7% retention after 300 cycles) and rate performance. The incorporation of amide&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes into SIBs infuses fresh vitality into electrolyte design, propelling the advancement of high&#8208;performance SIBs.

The designed DEE demonstrates exceptional ionic conductivity (4.03 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C), a high oxidation voltage (4.63&#160;V versus Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na), and nonflammability. The unique solvation structure markedly enhances the compatibility of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, with the NVP||Na cell exhibiting outstanding cycling performance (86.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability. Moreover, the DEEs exhibit robust performance at elevated temperatures (94.3% retention after 120 cycles with NVP||Na cell), and the full cell demonstrates significant enhancements in both cycle stability (90.7% retention after 300 cycles) and rate performance. The incorporation of amide-based eutectic electrolytes into SIBs infuses fresh vitality into electrolyte design, propelling the advancement of high-performance SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lean&#8208;Water Gel Electrolyte Enables Zinc Ion Battery at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study developed a water&#8208;in&#8208;polymer system formed by in situ polymerization of the DOL strategy, which exhibits excellent performance at low temperatures of &#8722;70 &#176;C due to its fast kinetic process. It can also change the storage model of H+ in the cathode, prevent electrode passivation, and achieve stable cycling under high loads. 








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are attracting growing interest in electrochemical energy storage due to safety, reliability, and affordability. However, water brings drawbacks including parasitic reactions, narrow electrochemical window, and cathode degradation. The freezing nature of water also challenges the zinc ion transport and storage at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, especially below &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. Here, we design a water&#8208;in&#8208;polymer electrolyte to confine water using a weak&#8208;solvation monomer&#8208;directed polymerization technique initiated by protons. This electrolyte strategy significantly suppresses the water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and widens the electrochemical window to 2.59&#160;V. Besides, a high ionic conductivity of 0.36&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 is achieved at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C benefiting from unique fast ion transport channel and favorable desolvation process at the interface. Symmetric Zn cells exhibit excellent cycle stability over 10&#160;000&#160;h (437 days) at room temperature (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@1 mAh cm&#8722;2) and 700&#160;h at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (5.25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@5.25 mAh cm&#8722;2). Zn||Zn0.58V2O5 full cells show impressive performance under high mass loading and low temperatures originating from the suppression of H+ insertion. The electrolyte strategy in this work will inspire more efforts for water confinement in aqueous batteries.

         <title>Active Transport of Macrocycles into Micelles Using Molecular Pumps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial molecular pumps attached to polymeric micelles were found capable of transporting charged macrocycles into the micelles. The pumps operate with only modestly reduced pumping efficiency as compared to nonmicellar counterparts, indicating that ring&#8208;threading molecular pumps can transport charged solutes into supramolecular assemblies, akin to nature's transmembrane transporters which actively transport solutes into and out of cells.








Abstract
During the past decade, researchers have designed and synthesised a variety of artificial molecular pumps capable of the active transport of macrocycles (rings) from free solution into mechanically interlocked states. In their ability to drive non&#8208;equilibrium transport, these artificial molecular pumps imitate natural transmembrane transporters, which are widespread in living organisms. Despite this resemblance, ring&#8208;threading molecular pumps have not previously been operated in aqueous supramolecular assemblies in imitation of their natural counterparts. Here, we demonstrate the active transport of charged macrocycles from aqueous solution into micellar assemblies of polymer chains, which remain stable after pumping has occurred. While micelles are used routinely to encapsulate and solubilise hydrophobic small molecules in aqueous solution, this report, by contrast, shows that artificial molecular pumps can harness external energy to drive hydrophilic molecules into micelles where they are stored at concentrations far from equilibrium.

         <title>A Chemical Glycoproteomic Approach Decrypts Urinary Extracellular Vesicle Surfaceome for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Grading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for extracellular vesicle surface comprehensive one&#8208;pot proteomic exploration (EVscope) is developed. EVscope unlocks the high&#8208;resolution surfaceome profiling from small&#8208;volume biofluids within a short time and identifies prostate cancer biomarkers by generating the largest urine&#8208;derived EV surface protein dataset to date.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicle (EV) surface proteins serve as the fundamental signaling mediators, determining the communication function of EVs. The selective and in&#8208;depth exploration of EV surface proteome (surfaceome) is highly compelling but remains technically challenging due to the unique physicochemical properties of surface proteins. These hurdles are further compounded by the inherent heterogeneity of EVs and the low abundance of surface targets in biofluids. Herein, we developed a chemical glycoproteomic strategy, EVscope (EV surface comprehensive one&#8208;pot proteomic exploration), for comprehensively profiling the EV surfaceome. The hydrophilic and aromatic lipophilic group&#8208;modified magnetic beads enable bias&#8208;free EV isolation and in situ oxidation and labeling of cis&#8208;diols on surface proteins. Subsequent on&#8208;bead processes, including EV lysis, protein digestion, and surface glycopeptide enrichment, collectively maximize surfaceome coverage. Applied to urine samples from 368 individuals with prostate&#8208;related diseases, EVscope identified 1,121 EV surface proteins, establishing the largest urine&#8208;derived EV surfaceome dataset to date and identifying cathepsin L, integrin alpha 3, fibrinogen beta chain, and tetraspanin&#8208;1 as characteristic proteins with potential as noninvasive biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and grading. In summary, this study establishes an innovative methodology for high&#8208;resolution EV surfaceome analysis, facilitating noninvasive biomarker discovery and enabling direct detection in population&#8208;scale screening.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds with High Efficiency and Alkyl Group Dihydroxylation of Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds is valuable for modulating properties and diversification. We report that perfluorinated ruthenium porphyrins catalyze the undirected C(sp3)&#9472;H oxidation of various natural products and drugs with high turnover numbers. In combination with directed C&#9472;H silylation, alkyl groups remote from existing functionality can be formally dihydroxylated.








Abstract
The late&#8208;stage oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds is highly valuable for modulating the solubility and binding of bioactive compounds and for diversification of complex molecules. Undirected methods for C(sp3)&#9472;H oxidation are valuable for the installation of hydroxyl groups at sites remote from other functional groups present in the molecule, but existing catalysts are limited by low turnover numbers and lengthy ligand syntheses. Perfluorinated ruthenium porphyrins are highly active catalysts for the oxidation of alkyl C&#9472;H bonds, but the scope of the transformation with complex molecules under conditions of limiting substrate has not been investigated. We report that carbonylruthenium(II) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin [Ru(TPFPP)(CO)] catalyzes the selective oxidation of tertiary C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in a broad range of complex natural products and drugs, with turnover numbers as high as 1000, and the tolerance of the reaction to various functional groups was rapidly assessed by performing a model reaction in the presence of additives. We show how the combination of this undirected C(sp3)&#9472;H oxidation and a directed C(sp3)&#9472;H silylation and oxidation provides rapid access to highly oxidized, 1,2&#8208;diol derivatives of natural products by a formal dihydroxylation of an alkyl group.

         <title>Topology Regulation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers for Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that the topology profoundly regulates the planarity, exciton binding energy, and electron push&#8211;pull effect of donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers. Thus, distinct topological arrangements lead to orders of magnitude differences in photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers, especially those with a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, are emerging as potent photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, even constructed with identical D&#8211;A building blocks, conjugated polymers with diverse topologies can yield distinct photocatalytic properties, underscoring the significance of topology regulation. Herein, two conjugated polymers, Bi&#8208;CBTP with a D&#8208;A2 motif and Tri&#8208;CBTP with a D&#8208;A3 motif, were designed with identical building blocks, and synthesized via a low&#8208;energy, rapid sonochemical method to investigate the influence of topologies on photocatalytic hydrogen production. Comprehensive theoretical calculations and femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy reveal that the topology profoundly regulates the planarity, exciton binding energy, and electron push&#8211;pull effect of the D&#8211;A conjugated polymer. Specifically, Bi&#8208;CBTP achieves a rather high hydrogen production rate of 516.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 as the state&#8208;of&#8208;art performance under simulated solar irradiation, along with a 61.2% apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420&#160;nm. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production.

         <title>Tuning the Adsorption of H and OH on Ruthenium Aerogel to Boost the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Ru hetero&#8208;phases (fcc/hcp) combined with Cr ions doping effectively weakens the strong adsorption of OH and H species on Ru sites. This modulation of adsorption energetics exposes more active Ru centers, thereby significantly enhancing the alkaline HER activity of the Ru aerogel.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is an ideal alternative to platinum for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its exceptional catalytic performance. However, during the reaction, the excessively strong adsorption of proton (H) and hydroxyl (OH) species on Ru significantly limits its alkaline HER activity. Herein, we enhanced the alkaline HER performance of Ru by modulating its crystalline phase structure and incorporating a low dosage of Cr ions. The synthesized Cr0.033Ru0.967 fcc/hcp aerogel exhibits a lower overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming Ru aerogels (Rufcc and Ruhcp) and commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, Cr0.033Ru0.967 fcc/hcp aerogel demonstrates a remarkable stability at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, sustaining continuous operation for 800&#160;h. Experimental results, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the heterogeneous phase interfaces in the CrRufcc/hcp aerogel effectively weaken the strong adsorption of H at Ru sites. Additionally, with their high affinity for OH species, Cr ions facilitate the removal of OH from adjacent Ru sites. Furthermore, Cr ion incorporation modifies the local electronic structure of Ru, further reducing its OH adsorption energy. This work highlights a synergistic approach to improving catalytic performance and offers a novel strategy for designing highly efficient and durable alkaline HER catalysts.

         <title>Bi&#9472;O Bridges Trigger Lattice Strain&#8208;Electronic Synergy at Inherent In Sites in ZnIn2S4 for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic Bi&#9472;O coordination in ZnIn2S4 triggers synergistic lattice strain and electronic rearrangement to activate Inherent In sites, significantly optimizing charge carrier dynamics and stabilizing key intermediates, thus enabling dual&#8208;site O2 adsorption&#8211;conversion and functioning as a proton reservoir. This design achieves an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate (6.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency (2.32%) with 97.3% selectivity for the 2e&#8722; pathway.








Abstract
Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis without sacrificial agents represents a promising yet challenging route for sustainable chemical production, hindered by low solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency (natural photosynthesis is only &#8764;0.1%). Notably, the abundant inherent active sites within base semiconductors remain substantially underutilized. Here, we incorporate Bi into ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) lattices through atomic&#8208;level Bi&#9472;O coordination, activating inherent In sites via synergistic lattice strain and electron rearrangement. Multiscale characterization confirms the formation of BiO2S2&#8211;ZIS with quantified 1.51% lattice elongation. Integrated theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses reveal that Bi&#9472;O coordination increases electron density at adjacent In sites, which lowers the p&#8208;band center and enhances carrier separation. Meanwhile, lattice strain strengthens Bi&#9472;O orbital hybridization and weakens In&#9472;O covalency. Thus, these effects cooperatively optimize carrier dynamics. Then, the O2 adsorption is Pauling&#8208;type at In site to Yeager&#8208;type adsorption at the In&#9472;Bi dual sites. Simultaneously, Bi&#9472;O bridges function as proton reservoirs to facilitate *OOH formation and *H2O2 synthesis through enhanced Coulombic interactions. The resulting strain&#8208;electron synergy achieves an unprecedented H2O2 production rate of 6.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 2.32% SCC efficiency, surpassing all reported inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts. This work demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance and establishes a highly effective strategy for inherent site activation.

         <title>Delocalized Frustrated Lewis Pairs in COF&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Transfer for Urea Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fluorinated Fe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COF photocatalyst, where F&#8208;functionalization creates electron&#8208;delocalized Fe&#8208;keto oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). The FLPs selectively adsorb and activate NO3&#8722; at Fe sites and CO2 at keto oxygen atoms, while enhancing charge separation and weakening Fe&#9472;N bonds to promote *NHx intermediate transfer, thereby enabling efficient photosynthesis of urea from CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;reduction. 








Abstract
Photosynthesis of urea through C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and nitrates (NO3&#8722;) represents a sustainable route for both carbon utilization and environmental remediation, yet remains fundamentally challenging due to competing parallel reduction reactions. Building upon hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base principles, we demonstrate that electronic delocalization modulation in iron (Fe)&#8208;keto oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) can effectively suppress these reductions while selectively promoting C&#9472;N coupling. To realize this strategy, we engineered a fluorinated Fe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (Fe/F&#9472;COF) photocatalyst, where F functionalization modulates the electronic structure to create electron&#8208;delocalized FLPs with precisely controlled Fe&#8208;keto oxygen spatial spacing at 3.4 &#197;. Experimental and computational results reveal that F&#8208;induced electron delocalization enhances Lewis acidity at Fe sites for NO3&#8722; activation and increases basicity at keto oxygen for the CO2 activation. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;delocalized Fe center exhibits softened acid character that weakens the Fe&#8208;N bond in adsorbed *NH species, facilitating N&#8208;transfer for C&#9472;N coupling. Such spatial and electronic configuration lowers the C&#9472;N coupling barrier, favoring *NHCO intermediate formation and subsequent urea production. The Fe/F&#8208;COF achieves a high urea yield rate of 93 &#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 1.1% at 400 nm, surpassing most reported photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction coupling systems to date.

Porous Ni(OH)2 (red, cyan and white balls integrated crystal) spatially confined Pt (silvery balls)&#8208;rich nanocages (resembling water plants with spores) form a dispersed surface electric field, achieving undifferentiated adsorption of solvent molecules (blue balls) in IHP and reversing the problem of catalyst degradation caused by the specific adsorption of solvent molecules in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (white balls for hydrogen). This phenomenon was validated by Wei Zhang, Xu Zou and Weitao Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202509268).

         <title>Biocatalytic Olefin Difunctionalization for Synthesis of Chiral 2&#8208;Azidoamines Using Nonheme Iron Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonheme iron enzyme, 4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase from Amycolatopsis orientalis (AoHMS), was engineered to catalyze enantioselective amino azidation via a stepwise nitrene addition and radical azide transfer.








Abstract
Alkene difunctionalization represents an important category of reactions in organic synthesis, with a diverse array of transformations developed over the past decades for various synthetic applications. Nevertheless, the scope and diversity of biocatalytic alkene difunctionalization have been limited, constraining its synthetic utility. In this study, we repurposed nonheme iron enzymes to generate iron nitrene intermediates for alkene difunctionalization. 4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase from Amycolatopsis orientalis (AoHMS) was successfully engineered for direct alkene aminoazidation to produce chiral 2&#8208;azidoamines. Directed evolution was performed on AoHMS to provide evolved variants that could utilize O&#8208;pivaloylhydroxylamine triflic acid as the nitrene precursor and produced various primary aminoazidation products with up to 44% yield, 44 total turnover number (TTN), and 98.5:1.5 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.). Mechanistic studies indicated that this new biocatalytic transformation proceeds through a stepwise radical addition and azide recombination pathway. This work expands the catalytic toolbox of metalloenzymes and opens up new opportunities for biosynthesis by introducing nonnatural olefin difunctionalization reactions into biocatalysis.

         <title>Transforming Chemiluminescence from Flash to Glow by Breaking the Catalytic Limitation with a Medium&#8208;Entropy Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic limitation of nanozymes severely restricts their high&#8208;active catalysis for achieving persistent chemiluminescence. A medium&#8208; entropy Prussian blue analogue is constructed to efficiently break the catalytic limitation and achieve the application of persistent chemiluminescence imaging. The mechanism is ascribed to the intrareticular electron transfer among the metal sites to accelerate the cycle of active valence.








Abstract
Intensive and persistent chemiluminescence (CL) emission is highly desired in biological imaging and is also a conundrum for most CL systems. Catalysts can efficiently improve the flash intensity but scarcely achieve persistent enhancement due to their catalytic limitation on CL reaction. Herein, a medium&#8208;entropy (ME) nanozyme with trinuclear configuration and a classical Prussian blue analogue (PBA) structure was designed to break the catalytic limitation. The ME PBA showed favorable enhancement on both flash and persistent CL emission of luminol&#8208;H2O2 system due to the recycling generation of catalytic center Co(II) through quick electron transfer among metal sites within framework, which provided a relatively stable CL emission enhanced by over two orders of magnitude in 1&#160;h, achieving the transformation of CL from flash to glow. The CL enhancement and active valence cycle mechanism via intrareticular electron transfer were revealed by both experiments and density functional theory calculations. A facile CL imaging method was proposed to evaluate the bacterial motility, which demonstrated the application potential of the ME PBA. This work offers a new avenue to transform CL from flash to glow by breaking the catalytic limitation of nanozymes, which will conveniently expand their application in bioanalysis.

         <title>Strong Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Induced Thermal Stabilization of Pt Single Atoms for Durable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are prone to sintering into larger particles under high&#8208;temperature oxidation. In contrast, a La2O3&#8208;modified Pt/Al2O3 catalyst undergoes a transformation to the formation of Al2O3&#8208;Pt1&#8208;La2O3 structure via strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI)&#8212;driven interfacial reconstruction during calcination, markedly improving CO oxidation performance and thermal durability.








Abstract
Supported metal nanoparticle catalysts often suffer from sintering&#8208;induced size&#8208;dependent deactivation, limiting their high&#8208;temperature applications. Although high&#8208;temperature redispersion offers a potential solution, this strategy remains restricted to reducible support materials, severely limiting the selection of catalyst supports with versatile compositions and tunable functionalities. Here, we engineer cationic vacancies at Al2O3&#8208;La2O3 interface via strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI)&#8212;driven interfacial reconstruction during calcination. The vacancy&#8208;mediated confinement effect dynamically intercepts migrating Pt species, enabling the construction of Al2O3&#8208;Pt1&#8208;La2O3 structure with precisely defined coordination environments. The resulting catalyst achieves complete CO conversion at 145&#160;&#176;C and maintains stability with minimal decline after a 6&#8208;h treatment at 1100&#160;&#176;C in air with 10% steam. This interfacial engineering strategy proves universal, as demonstrated by ZrO2&#8208;La2O3 counterparts. Our findings break the reducibility dependency in traditional single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) stabilization by establishing oxide&#8211;oxide interface as universal anchoring platforms, which expands the design space of industrial&#8208;grade SACs beyond conventional reducible oxides.

         <title>Edge/Corner&#8208;Sharing 2D Perovskite Functional Layer for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>

The special N&#8208;methylethylenediamine cations (MEDA2+) create the n&#8208;type edge/corner&#8208;sharing (E/C&#8208;sharing) [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral framework with narrow interlayer spacing, which boosts the octahedral interlayer coupling to improve carrier mobility. Furthermore, the resulting n&#8208;type E/C&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite functional layer at the perovskite/C60 interface reinforces surface lattice stability by inducing a compressive stress field and increasing defect formation energy and forms a type&#8208;II 3D/2D heterojunction for efficient electron transfer.








Abstract
Tuning the surface structure of perovskite films based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites with narrow octahedral interlayer spacing is essential yet challenging to mitigate quantum and dielectric confinement, achieve interfacial energy&#8208;level matching, and promote efficient carrier transport kinetics in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Innovatively, an n&#8208;type 2D perovskite functional layer featuring a distinctive edge/corner&#8208;sharing (E/C&#8208;sharing) [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral framework is constructed on a 3D film surface by utilizing N&#8208;methylethylenediamine cations (MEDA2+) to regulate the connection modes of [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral units. Specifically, the 2D&#8208;MEDAPb2I6 with the E/C&#8208;sharing octahedra yields the narrowest interlayer spacing recorded to date (8.39&#160;&#197;) among 2D perovskites, thus boosting the octahedral interlayer coupling effect and weakening the quantum and dielectric confinement effect to improve carrier mobility. Additionally, the 2D capping layer reinforces surface lattice stability by inducing a compressive stress field and increasing defect formation energy. The resulting type&#8208;II 3D/2D heterojunction significantly lowers the interfacial energy barriers for electron transfer and reduces the carrier recombination losses. Consequently, the inverted PSCs achieve an optimal efficiency of 26.43% (certified at 26.10%) and maintain over 94% of their initial efficiency after operating for 1200 hours under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. This research provides a unique perspective for developing novel 2D perovskites in perovskite&#8208;based photovoltaics.

         <title>An Electrochemical Study of Key Catalytically Active Gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic electrochemical investigation of Au(I) complexes sheds light on how ligand environments control gold oxidizability. Through cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) analysis, key trends are established for phosphine, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), and hemilabile P^N ligands, offering valuable insights into the design of efficient Au(I)/Au(III) catalytic cycles.








Abstract
Gold catalysis has long been dominated by the ability of gold(I) to activate unsaturated systems as a carbophilic Lewis acid. However, recent advances have highlighted the significance of Au(I)/Au(III) redox transitions, unlocking new catalytic pathways. Among the strategies facilitating these oxidative processes, electrochemical anodic oxidation has emerged as a powerful tool. Despite its potential, the electrochemical properties of key gold complexes remain largely underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate the oxidative behavior of a series of gold complexes using cyclic voltammetry. A comprehensive electrochemical scale is established, revealing that N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based gold complexes are among the least prone to oxidation, whereas phosphorylated ligands significantly enhance oxidizability. Within triphenylphosphine gold complexes, the nature of the X&#8208;type anionic ligand plays a crucial role in determining oxidative behavior, a trend rationalized through density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Additionally, hemilabile P^N ligands dramatically facilitate oxidation, correlating with their ability to promote oxidative addition. These findings provide fundamental insights into the redox properties of gold complexes, offering valuable guidelines for the design of new gold&#8208;catalyzed transformations.

         <title>Enhancing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Step&#8208;Growth Polymers by Narrowing Their Molar Mass Distribution: A Dynamic Bond&#8208;Mediated Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces asymmetric dynamic bond&#8208;mediated polymerization (ADBP), a method to narrow molar mass distributions in step&#8208;growth polymers via asymmetric, reversibly&#8208;deactivated AA'&#8208;type electrophiles. ADBP initially forms low&#8208;dispersity dimers/trimers, later polymerizing into polyurethanes with controlled dispersities (&#272;&#160;&#8804;&#160;1.5), yielding materials with enhanced nanostructure ordering and improved mechanical properties compared to traditional methods.








Abstract
Step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP) typically produces polymers with exceptional versatility in terms of applications, but its inherently uncontrolled nature leads to broad molecular weight distributions (&#272;) and consequently polymers with poor nanostructure control in comparison to chain growth polymers. In this study, we provide a solution to this long&#8208;lasting problem by introducing a new concept, asymmetric dynamic bond mediated polymerization (ADBP). In this case, the polymerization between asymmetric and reversibly deactivated AA&#8217;&#8208;type dielectrophiles and B2&#8208;type dinucleophiles has a preferential reaction pathway between the functionality A&#8217; of the asymmetric AA&#8217; monomer with B2. We observe that this polymerization allows us to achieve better control of the step&#8208;growth process where in the first stage only well&#8208;defined trimers and dimers are primarily formed up to conversion (p)&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.6, followed by their polymerization stage (p&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.6). This leads to polymers with reduced &#272; (&lt;1.5), in comparison to traditional SGP, and improved molar mass control. Such technique is further exploited to prepare polyurethanes with &#272;&#160;=&#160;1.2, which exhibit the ability to form microphase&#8208;separated domains with higher ordering, giving rise to polyurethane thermosets with superior mechanical properties compared to a traditional SGP analog.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis and Diversification of Thymine&#8208;Containing Bridged Nucleic Acids Through Cascade Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several processes are reported that enable the rapid diversification of bridged nucleoside analogues (NAs) starting from a common and readily prepared fluorohydrin. Also, several clinically relevant bridged nucleosides are now prepared in as few as three synthetic steps, creating new opportunities for examining structure&#8208;activity relationships within this important family of oligonucleotide building blocks. 2








Abstract
Bridged nucleic acids (BNAs) are nucleoside analogues (NAs) in which the 2&#8242;&#8208;alcohol is linked to the C4&#8242;&#8208;position on ribose. In oligonucleotide therapeutics (ONTs), BNAs can impart beneficial properties, including enhanced stability, duplex melting temperatures, and tissue half&#8208;lives. However, their lengthy syntheses challenge medicinal chemistry efforts and larger&#8208;scale production. Here we demonstrate that a wide range of BNAs can be produced with various locking ring sizes and substitution patterns from a common thymine&#8208;containing aldol product through cascade cyclization processes. Critically, several clinically relevant BNAs are now made available in as little as 3&#8211;5 steps. We expect these strategies will inspire and support medicinal and process chemistry efforts in this critical area for ONTs.

         <title>Aqueous Separation of Styrene from Ethylbenzene Using a Water&#8208;Soluble Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble, metal&#8208;free tetracationic cyclophane B enables&#160;&gt;99% selective extraction of styrene (ST) from ethylbenzene (EB) in water. B has an adaptive hydrophobic cavity that favors planar guests via noncovalent interactions and induced fit, offering a recyclable, shape&#8208;selective strategy for hydrocarbon separation.








Abstract
The selective separation of hydrocarbons such as styrene (ST) and ethylbenzene (EB) remains a formidable challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their nearly identical molecular structures and physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a robust, water&#8208;soluble, metal&#8208;free tetracationic cyclophane (B) capable of achieving&#160;&gt;99% selective extraction of ST from EB in aqueous media with excellent recyclability. B features a hydrophobic, conformationally adaptive cavity (&#8764;6.5&#160;&#197;&#160;&#215;&#160;14.3&#160;&#197;) that selectively recognizes planar over nonplanar guests in aqueous medium. Solution&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state analyses confirm that the preferential binding of ST is driven by favorable interactions with its vinyl group and induced planarization of the host. B also distinguishes phenanthrene (P) from 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene (DHA), further validating its precision in shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition. Our findings demonstrate a unique aqueous separation of ST from EB employing a metal&#8208;free receptor that advances the design of selective host&#8211;guest systems and supports greener alternatives for hydrocarbon purification.

         <title>Stereoselective Nucleophilic Di&#8208; and Monofluoro(sulfoximidoyl)Methylation of C&#9552;C Bonds: Remote Neighboring Group Participation Enables Facile Access to Chiral &#947;&#8208;Fluorinated Amines</title>

Chiral &#947;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;amines: Highly stereoselective nucleophilic fluoromethylation of C&#9552;C bonds with fluorinated sulfoximines was achieved by remote neighboring group participation of the nitro group. This transformation provides an effective solution to the long&#8208;standing challenge of the synthesis of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;difluoro&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;monofluoroamines.








Abstract
There remains an ongoing challenge to develop facile methods for the preparation of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;difluorinated amines, which are commonly considered a privileged motif in bioactive compounds. In this context, we report a straightforward protocol for the stereoselective nucleophilic difluoro(sulfoximidoyl)methylation of C&#9552;C bonds (considered to be more challenging than the reported C&#9552;O bonds), which exhibits high stereoselectivity and broad substrate scope. The key features of this chemistry include 1) stereoselective addition of the difluoro(sulfoximidoyl)methyl anion to C&#9552;C bonds, although it was considered to be highly unfavorable from the view of hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base (HSAB) theory; 2) intriguing neighboring group participation of the oxygen from the nitro group that was found to play a crucial role in controlling the stereoselectivity and efficiency of the transformation and was supported by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. This method has been applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of several complex molecules and the preparation of enantioenriched bioactive &#947;&#8208;fluorinated amines, such as a phytopathogenic fungi inhibitor, TRPC6 and CDK11 inhibitors, and even monofluorinated lorcaserin, which further demonstrated the significance and potential of this approach.

         <title>Formal Cyclopropylation of Imines with Cyclopropanols: Stereocontrolled Access to Conformationally Constrained &#947;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>

A formal cyclopropylation of imines with cyclopropanols enables stereoselective access to cyclopropane&#8208;embedded &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols bearing three contiguous stereocenters. The transformation proceeds through a sequence of Mannich&#8208;type addition and ring closure involving enolized zinc homoenolate, and is applicable to both N&#8208;sulfonyl and chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl trifluoromethyl imines, providing building blocks diversifiable to various aminocarbonyl compounds.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Amino alcohols are essential motifs in bioactive compounds and chiral catalysts, yet the synthesis of their conformationally constrained variants remains challenging due to the lack of suitable methodologies. Here, we report a formal cyclopropylation of imines with cyclopropanols, enabling the construction of previously inaccessible cyclopropane&#8208;embedded &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols. This transformation leverages the unique reactivity of enolized zinc homoenolates, which effectively act as a &#946;&#8208;hydroxycyclopropyl anions and engage imines through a sequence of Mannich addition and ring closure. The key to this reactivity lies in the use of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, which promote efficient coupling with N&#8208;sulfonyl aldimines as well as chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl trifluoromethyl&#8208;ketimines while ensuring excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters. Furthermore, the resulting &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols can be transformed into &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;aminofunctionalized ketones via homoenolate or &#946;&#8208;keto radical intermediates, offering versatile platforms for downstream derivatization.

         <title>C60 Fullerene as the Active Site for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal a striking finding: Fullerene (C60), beyond its classical role as an electron buffer, can directly serve as a molecular active site for CO&#8322; reduction. Through data mining, ab initio simulations, and pH&#8211;field coupled microkinetics, we uncover that C60&#8217;s unique curvature induces strong dipole responses, stabilizing COOH* intermediates and enabling a pH&#8208;dependent volcano. This work redefines the catalytic nature of curved carbon materials.








Abstract
Fullerene (C60) was considered as a catalyst promoter in various electrochemical reactions, yet its catalytic role in enhancing catalytic performance beyond electron transfer remains a puzzle to chemists. Traditional simulations imply C60&#8217;s inertness in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to weak interaction with COOH* intermediates. Here, according to a pH&#8208;field coupled microkinetic model at reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, we demonstrate that C60 acts as molecular active sites to facilitate the CO2RR toward CO through a strong binding to COOH* in the electrochemical conditions. This binding is mainly due to the unique structure of C60 that induces large dipole moment changes to stabilize COOH* intermediates across different pH conditions. By detailed comparison of experimental CO2RR observations and quantitative pH&#8208;dependent modeling, this work provides new insights on C60&#8208;based catalysts, highlighting the large dipole moment change upon adsorption at curved surfaces should not be dismissed when analyzing the pH&#8208;dependent binding strength and electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Unraveling the Potential&#8208;Regulated Selectivity of the Cu&#8208;Based Catalyst in 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential&#8208;regulated selectivity of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst in 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electro&#8208;oxidation is revealed. At high potentials, CuO&#8208;derived CuOOH indirectly oxidizes HMF, preferentially targeting the aldehyde (&#8208;CHO) group. Further potential increase activates the CuOOH&#8208;mediated direct oxidation process, shifting selectivity toward the less reactive hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) group since enhanced surface coverage mainly hinders &#8208;CHO adsorption.








Abstract
2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), prepared via the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (HMFOR), is a promising bio&#8208;based plastic monomer for biodegradable polymer production. However, the sluggish hydroxyl oxidation kinetics inhibit the HMFOR efficiency. In this study, CuOxHy is grown on Cu foam as a model electrocatalyst to investigate the active phases of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst in the HMFOR, elucidate their oxidation mechanisms and adsorption behaviors at varying potentials, and ultimately to reveal the potential&#8208;regulated selectivity of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CuIII&#9472;OOH, generated from CuO at high potentials, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, enabling HMFOR to proceed via an indirect oxidation process that favors aldehyde oxidation. A further increase in potential activates the direct oxidation process of CuIII&#9472;OOH, selectively oxidizing hydroxyl groups owing to the increased substrate coverage on the catalyst, which hinders aldehyde adsorption. This study offers a new strategy for enhancing the selectivity towards the oxidation of specific functional groups in value&#8208;added biomass conversion processes.

&lt;p&gt;The potential-regulated selectivity of the Cu-based catalyst in 5-hydroxymethylfurfural electro-oxidation is revealed. At high potentials, CuO-derived CuOOH indirectly oxidizes HMF, preferentially targeting the aldehyde (-CHO) group. Further potential increase activates the CuOOH-mediated direct oxidation process, shifting selectivity toward the less reactive hydroxyl (-OH) group since enhanced surface coverage mainly hinders -CHO adsorption.

&lt;p&gt;2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), prepared via the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural electro-oxidation reaction (HMFOR), is a promising bio-based plastic monomer for biodegradable polymer production. However, the sluggish hydroxyl oxidation kinetics inhibit the HMFOR efficiency. In this study, CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; is grown on Cu foam as a model electrocatalyst to investigate the active phases of the Cu-based catalyst in the HMFOR, elucidate their oxidation mechanisms and adsorption behaviors at varying potentials, and ultimately to reveal the potential-regulated selectivity of the Cu-based catalyst. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;OOH, generated from CuO at high potentials, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, enabling HMFOR to proceed via an indirect oxidation process that favors aldehyde oxidation. A further increase in potential activates the direct oxidation process of Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;OOH, selectively oxidizing hydroxyl groups owing to the increased substrate coverage on the catalyst, which hinders aldehyde adsorption. This study offers a new strategy for enhancing the selectivity towards the oxidation of specific functional groups in value-added biomass conversion processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Assisted Tandem Electrocatalysis for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H5OH Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
An Ag@AgCu core@satellites electrocatalyst were designed to reveal the plasmon assisted tandem electrochemical CO2 reduction for high&#8208;selective C2H5OH production. An intensive localized electric field could be excited in the near&#8208;surface region of Ag@AgCu core@satellites under light irradiation, contributing to a high C2H5OH Faradic efficiency of 65.5% at industrial&#8208;level current density (&#8722;280&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in a photo&#8208;electrochemical flow cell. 








Abstract
An Ag@AgCu core@satellites electrocatalyst, structured with AgCu alloyed nano&#8208;islands dispersed at metallic Ag core surface, was designed to reveal the plasmon&#8208;assisted tandem electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) for selective C2H5OH production. As unraveled by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations, the core@satellites microstructure enables the tandem ECO2RR pathway to happen at the interfaced Ag and AgCu sites to facilitate C2H5OH formation, with Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H5OH reaching 61.4% at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Under light, an intensive localized electric field could be excited in the near&#8208;surface region of Ag@AgCu core@satellites, contributing to the increased surface *CO coverage, lowered *COCOH formation barrier and deceased *CHCOH&#8208;to&#8208;C2H5OH conversion free energy. Thus, a high C2H5OH selectivity (FE&#160;=&#160;65.5%) at industrial&#8208;level current density (&#8722;280&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) was achieved over Ag@AgCu core@satellites in a photo&#8208;electrochemical flow cell.

         <title>Amplifying Intermetal Bias of Pt&#8208;Rh Alloy Nanolayers for Facilitated Hydrogen Inter&#8208;Diffusion and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermetal bias in well&#8208;designed PtRh alloy nanolayers is amplified by the rectifying contact with rationally designed nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons support to simultaneously promote the intrinsic catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction and the lifespan of the whole proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer driven by renewable electricity has been regarded as a sustainable energy production technology, but is greatly limited by the high cost and unsatisfactory durability of noble metal catalysts. Here, we present the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of the amplified intermetal bias in PtRh alloy nanolayer to promote the intrinsic catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction and the lifespan of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Both experimental and theoretical results revealed the key role of the intermetal bias between Pt and Rh amplified by the rectifying contact with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons support in accelerating the pre&#8208;enrichment of protons on Rh sites, diffusion of H species from Rh to Pt sites, and final H dissociation from Pt sites. Consequently, the optimized Pt3Rh2/NC cathode with the most pronounced intermetal bias gives a record&#8208;high mass activity of 282&#160;A&#160;mgPt+Rh&#8722;1 at a cell voltage of 1.8&#160;V in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Moreover, the Pt3Rh2/NC cathode can reduce the proton diffusion resistance from 0.95&#160;&#937; of Pt/C to 0.69&#160;&#937; at a cell voltage of 1.5&#160;V due to the promoted hydrogen species diffusion on catalyst surface, largely decreasing the cell voltage and extending the lifespan by 3.2 times.

         <title>Hydrothermal Processing as an Effective Strategy for Producing Coordinated Non&#8208;Aromatic Hydrogels With Persistent and Reversible UV&#8208;Activated Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrothermal processing strategy has been proposed for the preparation of non&#8208;traditional room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) hydrogels. Through &#8220;metal ion coordination&#8208;induced clustering of non&#8208;conventional chromophores&#8221;, the resulting hydrogels exhibit long lifetime and reversible UV&#8208;activated RTP emission, which can be applied in fields such as self&#8208;erasing encryption and ultrasensitive antibiotic detection.








Abstract
The development of non&#8208;aromatic hydrogels with unique persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) through simple preparation methods remains a great challenge. Here, we propose and demonstrate a facile and universal hydrothermal processing strategy for transforming mechanical weak and non&#8208;RTP emissive non&#8208;aromatic hydrogels into mechanically very strong and persistent RTP hydrogels by metal ion coordination&#8208;induced clustering of non&#8208;conventional chromophores. As a model system, through hydrothermal processing in a solution of aluminum ions, polyacrylamide hydrogels show dramatically enhanced mechanical properties with tensile strength and elastic modulus up to 12.8 and 75.1&#160;MPa, respectively, and very impressively, they also exhibit excellent RTP properties with long lifetime up to 169.7&#160;ms and very interesting reversible UV&#8208;activated RTP emission. The UV&#8208;activated and persistent RTP emission enable innovative applications of the hydrogels in self&#8208;erasing encryption and ultrasensitive antibiotic sensing. The hydrothermal processing strategy can be applied to preparing other RTP hydrogels by using different polymeric matrices and metal ions. This work establishes a universal paradigm for developing multifunctional RTP hydrogels through metal ion coordination and provides a basis for their practical applications.

         <title>Impact of Coordination Environment for Designing Ru&#8208;Based Alloy Catalysts for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An descriptor, coordination impact, that unifies ligand and structural effects to quantify the influence of neighboring atoms on the electronic structure of adsorption sites, enabling site&#8208;activity plots that identify optimal active&#8208;site environments. The highest catalytic activity for ammonia decomposition is achieved when the coordination impact is 6.1.








Abstract
Alloying is an effective strategy to modulate a metal catalyst's electronic structure and optimize its performance, but developing a fundamental design principle has been challenging due to the geometric and electronic disturbance between the active atom and its microenvironment. We introduce a descriptor, coordination impact, which combines ligand and structural effects to quantify the influence of neighboring atoms on the electronic structure of the adsorption site. Using first&#8208;principles simulations, microkinetic model and experimental data, we thoroughly examine the catalytic performance of RuM alloys for ammonia decomposition using this descriptor. The microenvironment influences the activity of adsorption site by modulating the orbital interaction between the active site and adsorbate. The descriptor follows a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with reaction rates, consistent with Sabatier principle, and the predicted rates are experimentally validated.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Electron&#8208;Sponge&#8208;Mediated Photooxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient POM&#8208;mediated photooxidative hydroxylation system was developed with excellent compatibility to accommodate a wide range of substrates and POMs. Replacing 90% PS with POMs, the photo&#8208;oxidation efficiency increased nearly 3.2&#8208;fold higher than the 100% PSs system due to the rapid electron acceptance, storage, and release capabilities of POMs, thus substantially decreasing the usage of noble&#8208;metal PSs. 








Abstract
Reducing costs while maintaining efficiency in photocatalytic systems remains a major pursuit in the field of solar photocatalysis. Herein, we explore a universal strategy for regulating electronic transfer by employing earth&#8208;abundant polyoxometalates (POMs) as electron sponges, dramatically promoting electron shuttling between photosensitizers (PSs) and substrates. This approach enables highly efficient photooxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids while significantly reducing the usage of noble&#8208;metal PSs. Typically, replacing 90% PS [Ir(bpy)(coumarin6)2]+ (Ir&#8208;2) with an earth&#8208;abundant Co7 POM ([{(B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PW9O34)Co3(OH)(H2O)2(O3PC(O)(C3H6NH3)PO3)}2Co]14&#8722;) can efficiently boost photo&#8208;oxidation efficiency, achieving complete substrate conversion within 3&#160;h in air, &#8764;3.2 or 5.6 times higher than the system with 100% or 10% Ir&#8208;2, respectively. Notably, this strategy exhibits excellent compatibility with a wide range of substrates and POMs. Systematic kinetic studies and unique &#8220;heteropoly blue&#8221; characteristic of POMs clearly demonstrated their excellent capabilities for electron accepting, storing, and releasing in these photo&#8208;oxidation systems. These properties can significantly promote electron transfer and stabilize reduced PSs, resulting in over five&#8208;fold increase in O2&#8226;&#8722; generation under weak visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;&#160;&gt;&#160;420&#160;nm, 50&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) compared to POM&#8208;free systems. This work not only opens an avenue for efficient photochemical synthesis but also highlights a promising new direction for POM application.

         <title>Bispecific DNA&#8208;Peptide Probes for Targeting Receptor Pairs on Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA duplex&#8208;programmed presentation of two different (cyclo)peptides provides bispecific agents that recognize unique fingerprints of cells through improved avidity and specificity. Bispecific DNA&#8208;cyclopeptide complexes enabled a cell&#8208;specific targeting and internalization of cytotoxic payload. 








Abstract
Chemical modification and nucleic acid self&#8208;assembly can be used to make protein receptor ligands form specific arrangements. While this property has been extensively exploited for probing of homomultivalent interactions, there has been comparatively little attention paid to the exploration of heteromultivalent interactions. In this study, we investigated the use of readily assemblable DNA duplexes for programming bispecific targeting of specific cell types. In contrast to previous bispecific agents, we leverage the potential of peptide&#8208;based high&#8208;affinity binders of cell surface proteins used in diagnostics/therapeutics. Systematic spatial screening revealed the optimal distance between two (cyclo)peptides required for selectively recognizing cells expressing unique combinations of receptors. The VGFR2/&#945;V&#946;3 receptor system on HUVECs was tolerant to changes of the distance between two cyclopeptides (L and cyclo(&#8208;RGDf(N&#8208;Me)K&#8208;)) and required that the distance exceeded the equivalent of 20 nucleotides distance. A different distance&#8208;affinity landscape was observed for recognition of EGFR and MET on A549 cells (through GE11 and bicyclic peptide GE&#8208;137). The DNA&#8208;programmed bispecific binders demonstrated specificity and efficient internalization into target cells. Auristatin&#8208;loaded DNA enabled a selective targeting of cytotoxic payload. Of note, the distance&#8208;optimized bispecific DNA&#8208;peptide probes have much lower molecular weight than previously used agents based on DNA nanostructures or antibodies.

         <title>Three Is Better than One: A Multimetal Complex that Triggers Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple metal prodrug that codelivers PtII, RuII, and AuI species triggers a potent immunogenic cell death (ICD) response via combined Type I/II pathways. The tri&#8208;metallic scaffold promotes tumor inhibition, immune memory, and peripheral leukocyte activation, offering a next&#8208;generation chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic approach (created in BioRender. Babu, T., 2025).








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a form of regulated cell death capable of stimulating an adaptive immune response through release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). While several metal complexes have shown promise as ICD inducers, conjugates containing more than one metal center remain to be explored for ICD. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a tri&#8208;metallic AuI&#8208;PtIV&#8208;RuII prodrug (5) that codelivers oxaliplatin (Type I ICD inducer), RuII arene 2&#8208;pyridinecarbothioamides (Type I), and Au(I) bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic (Type II) using a single scaffold. Upon reduction, complex 5 releases all three cytotoxic species, resulting in enhanced inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1&amp;2), elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in vitro DAMP release. In vivo studies of complex 5 in a colorectal cancer mouse model demonstrated tumor growth suppression, reduced off&#8208;target metal accumulation, and improved immune memory in a tumor challenge study compared to a 1:1:1 mixture of the constituent agents. Furthermore, peripheral white blood cell (WBC) profiling revealed that complex 5 activates both the innate and adaptive immune compartments. This study demonstrates an integrated chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy that unifies multiple ICD triggers within a single prodrug framework. It thus highlights a promising approach to the creation of metal&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapies.

Traditionally regarded as an electron reservoir, C60 is now revealed as a direct catalytic site for CO2 electroreduction. Combining data mining, ab initio simulations, and pH&#8211;field coupled microkinetics, Hao Li et&#160;al. uncover in their Research Article (e202511924) how C60&#8217;s curvature&#8208;induced dipole response stabilizes COOH*, enabling pH&#8208;sensitive volcano tuning and redefining the catalytic role of curved carbon materials.

Molecular sieving of xylene isomers was achieved by Myoung Soo Lah et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202512244), using a pillar&#8208;layered MOF, Ni&#8208;HDB, incorporating DABCO pillars that block lateral diffusion and enforce transport through elliptical windows. This confined geometry enables record selectivity for PX and EB over OX via kinetic sieving, offering a new strategy for energy&#8208;efficient hydrocarbon separation.

Grain boundary engineering offers a new paradigm for boosting CO2 electroreduction. As highlighted in this image, grain boundary&#8208;rich SnS nanorings serve as a highly efficient &#8220;formate factory&#8221;. CO2 molecules are transported to grain boundary regions, which act as entrances to high&#8208;speed catalytic pathways where formate production is strongly accelerated. Outside these boundaries, the reaction proceeds less efficiently, as reported by Yang Liu et al. in their Research Article (e202510973).

         <dc:description>
Knowing the oxidative potentials of gold complexes is essential for a better understanding of their implications in various mechanisms, and also crucial for the rational design of new catalysts. In their Communication (e202509683), V&#233;ronique Michelet, Romain Melot, and co&#8208;workers determined these data using cyclic voltammetry and established key trends based on the nature of the ligands involved. As illustrated in this image, the electrochemical investigation of Au(I) complexes sheds light on how ligand structure significantly impacts gold oxidizability.

F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems with luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) as donors and acceptors (inter&#8208;NP FRET) combine unique photophysical properties with large sizes. This review discusses the influence of NP type, architecture, surface chemistry, and optical properties on FRET and the pros and cons of inter&#8208;NP FRET for bioanalytical applications.








Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) enables the quantification of nanoscale distances and biomolecular interactions. Luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) are frequently combined with fluorescent dyes or proteins in FRET. However, their use in inter&#8208;NP FRET with luminescent NPs as both donor and acceptor remains less common due to the inherent size constraints that can limit FRET efficiencies. This review critically examines the early advances and current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of inter&#8208;NP FRET with a focus on the most commonly used NPs, namely quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), and fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs). We show how NP sizes, surface shells, and coatings increase FRET&#8208;distances; propose how these drawbacks can be overcome or outcompeted by the unique photophysical properties of the NPs; and discuss representative examples of inter&#8208;NP FRET for biosensing. High luminescence brightness, outstanding photostability, near&#8208;infrared excitation and emission, spectral and temporal multiplexing, and large surfaces for multifunctional bioconjugation are only some of the features that make luminescent NPs very attractive for biosensing, and FRET efficiencies up to 90% have demonstrated their potential for successful translation into bioanalytical applications.

         <title>Combined Inductive and Dispersion Effects Enhance Bioorthogonal Reactivity of Tetrazines Toward Isonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>

Bulky, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents can significantly enhance the reactivity and stability of tetrazines toward isonitriles, addressing a key challenge in bioorthogonal chemistry. This study explores the role of frontier&#8208;orbital interactions, dispersion forces, and molecular conformation in optimizing tetrazine performance, leading to highly reactive and orthogonal bioorthogonal reagents.









Abstract
Inverse&#8208;electron demand cycloaddition reactions of tetrazines are widely used in bioorthogonal chemistry, but the opposing effects of substituents on reactivity and stability make optimizing tetrazines for chemical biology applications challenging. Building on the discovery that bulky substituents can unexpectedly enhance both the stability of tetrazines and their reactivity toward isonitriles, we hypothesized that substituents that are both bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing could yield tetrazines with desirable properties. We synthesized a series of tetrazines designed to explore these kinetic properties. A novel computational method quantifying intermolecular atomic contributions to dispersion forces supported the analysis substituent effects on tetrazine reactivity. Study results indicate that tetrazine reactivity is governed by an interplay of frontier&#8208;orbital levels, dispersion forces, and conformational preferences. These insights were apparent in the form of a &#8220;bromo effect,&#8221; where bromine atoms enhanced tetrazine reactivity by influencing frontier&#8208;orbital levels and increasing dispersion forces. Notably, 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;bromopropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine exhibited a &#8764;80&#8208;fold increase in reactivity to isonitriles compared to dimethyltetrazine with high orthogonality to other dienophiles. The 2&#8208;bromoprop&#8208;2&#8208;yl group could also be incorporated into asymmetric tetrazines for tuning reactivity properties. In addition to introducing novel tetrazines for bioorthogonal chemistry, this work provides valuable insights into the role of dispersion forces in the transition states of cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Specific Recognition of Cysteine in a Mixed&#8208;Valence Bimetallic Organic Framework with Unique Channel Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional mixed&#8208;valence bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) features unique tubular and sinuous channels alongside ligand&#8208;provided active sites, and exhibits exceptional colorimetric selectivity for detecting cysteine or cysteine residues. This specific synergistic interaction enables the MOF to function as a highly promising sensor for monitoring thiolase enzyme activity, underscoring its significant potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
We have successfully designed and synthesized a mixed&#8208;valence bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), denoted ZnCoBTCHx, featuring periodic tubular and sinuous channels along with active sites provided by the ligands. This MOF demonstrates exceptional colorimetric selectivity toward cysteine (Cys). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state&#160;13C NMR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory calculations complementarily validate the valence state switching of cobalt centers in ZnCoBTCHx, the host&#8211;guest interactions and significant electron transfer between Cys and the framework. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry data suggest potential adsorption occurring within the channels of ZnCoBTCHx. In contrast, the mixed&#8208;valence CdCoBTCHx possesses a monoporous architecture wherein all potential N/O donor atoms of the ligands are engage in metal coordination. CdCoBTCHx displays a colorimetric response not only to Cys but also to other sulfur&#8208;containing amino acids. Notably, ZnCoBTCHx represents the first reported MOF that exhibits the ability to selectively recognize Cys residues in polypeptides and enzymes. This distinctive property enables ZnCoBTCHx to serve as a promising sensor for thiolase activity, underscoring its significant potential for biomedical applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a nanopore&#8208;based biosensor for single&#8208;molecule protein profiling using aptamer&#8208;modified DNA carrier dimerization strategy, enabling selective and ultrasensitive detection of proteins and protein complexes. This approach promises advances in early&#8208;stage clinical diagnostics and precision medicine.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.

         <title>Gamma Ray Radiation Promotes Linker Mixing in Multivariate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time explore a novel and simple route to construct a mixed&#8208;linker&#8208;based multivariate metal&#8208;organic framework (MTV&#8208;MOF) of imidazole&#8208;incorporated zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 by 60Co gamma ray radiation under ambient conditions. Notably, the distinct radiation&#8208;induced activation of the synthesis reaction gives rise to a much higher mixed&#8208;linker incorporation limit in ZIF&#8208;7, up to twice that synthesized by the solvothermal process, further leading to increased flexibility of aperture, higher specific surface area, and notably enhanced separation performances for Kr and Xe.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;linker&#8208;based multivariate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;MOFs) recently received considerable research effort because they exhibit tailored physicochemical properties that are often not possessed by single&#8208;linker MOFs and therefore find unique applications. Relative to the pristine linker, the incorporated linkers may tend to form different topologies, bringing about lattice mismatch and structural disorder. This leads to a low mixed&#8208;linker incorporation limit, and further increasing the linker incorporation rate may disrupt the crystallinity of the parent MOF, resulting in amorphous products or other topologies. Therefore, increasing the linker incorporation rate without changing the structure of the parent MOF represents a challenge. Herein, for the first time, an MTV&#8208;MOF of imidazole&#8208;incorporated zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 is constructed by 60Co gamma ray radiation. Both experiments and theoretic calculations demonstrate that the distinct radiation&#8208;induced activation of the synthesis reaction gives rise to a much higher mixed&#8208;linker incorporation limit in ZIF&#8208;7, up to twice that synthesized by the solvothermal process, further leading to increased flexibility of aperture, higher specific surface area, and notably enhanced separation performances for Kr and Xe. These observations suggest that radiation synthesis may emerge as a general route to a series of MTV&#8208;MOFs with significantly enhanced linker mixing limit and physicochemical properties.

         <title>Ultrathin Aromatic Polyamide Membranes with Tunable Microporosity for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin aromatic polyamide membranes with tunable microporous structures were fabricated by modulation&#8208;assisted IP strategy for organic solvent nanofiltration. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of membranes are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate IP. Moreover, the optimized membranes demonstrate exceptional performance in separating high&#8208;value active pharmaceutical ingredients compared to commercial membranes.








Abstract
Advanced membrane technology for the separation and purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) requires improvement in both membrane materials and manufacturing processes to achieve&#160;the high rejection of macromolecular solutes combined with high permeance for organic solvents in pharmaceutical industry. Here, we report a novel approach to preparing aromatic polyamide membranes (PAMs) with tunable microporosity and micropore size via modulator&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of PAMs are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate interfacial polymerization, which can be demonstrated through experiments and molecular simulations. The resulting optimal membrane achieves a methanol permeance of 11.9&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, representing a impressive 19.8&#8208;fold increase compared to commercial benchmark membrane (0.6&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;bar&#8722;1) at the same molecular weight cut&#8208;off (&#8764;460&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1). For&#160;practical applications, the optimal membrane demonstrates exceptional capability in the separation of high&#8208;value APIs such as dipyridamole, achieving not only accelerated ethanol permeance but also a 6&#8208;fold enrichment factor relative to commercial membranes. This work demonstrates the significant potential of phenolphthalein&#8208;based microporous polyamide membrane in advancing API separation technologies. It provides valuable insights into the development of next&#8208;generation membrane systems tailored for pharmaceutical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin aromatic polyamide membranes with tunable microporous structures were fabricated by modulation-assisted IP strategy for organic solvent nanofiltration. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of membranes are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate IP. Moreover, the optimized membranes demonstrate exceptional performance in separating high-value active pharmaceutical ingredients compared to commercial membranes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced membrane technology for the separation and purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) requires improvement in both membrane materials and manufacturing processes to achieve&#160;the high rejection of macromolecular solutes combined with high permeance for organic solvents in pharmaceutical industry. Here, we report a novel approach to preparing aromatic polyamide membranes (PAMs) with tunable microporosity and micropore size via modulator-assisted interfacial polymerization. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of PAMs are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate interfacial polymerization, which can be demonstrated through experiments and molecular simulations. The resulting optimal membrane achieves a methanol permeance of 11.9&#160;L&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing a impressive 19.8-fold increase compared to commercial benchmark membrane (0.6&#160;L&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at the same molecular weight cut-off (&#8764;460&#160;g&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). For&#160;practical applications, the optimal membrane demonstrates exceptional capability in the separation of high-value APIs such as dipyridamole, achieving not only accelerated ethanol permeance but also a 6-fold enrichment factor relative to commercial membranes. This work demonstrates the significant potential of phenolphthalein-based microporous polyamide membrane in advancing API separation technologies. It provides valuable insights into the development of next-generation membrane systems tailored for pharmaceutical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Confinement of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Like Host&#8211;Guest Polyoxovanadate in Giant Ag0/I Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular confinement in silver nanochemistry was demonstrated. Two cyclodextrin&#8208;like host&#8211;guest cyclic polyoxovanadate (POV) supermolecules were constructed, which served as templates for the formation of POV&#8208;bearing giant Ag0/I nanoclusters.








Abstract
Although polyoxovanadates (POVs) and their silver nanocluster composites have attracted significant research attention owing to their remarkable structural diversity and multifunctional properties, the mechanistic interplay between their dual chemical roles&#8212;serving simultaneously as host matrices in supramolecular architectures and as structural templates directing silver nanocluster (Ag NC) assembly&#8212;remains insufficiently understood. Herein, we systematically optimized the condensation of {VOx} (x&#160;=&#160;4, 5) tetrahedra or square pyramids around simple anions (S2&#8722; and SO42&#8722;) to tailor two distinct host&#8211;guest cyclodextrin&#8208;like POV supermolecules: [S@V16O48]18&#8722; and [SO4@V14O42]16&#8722;. Remarkably, these two cyclic POVs were generated in situ and have never been observed before, either in vanadate chemistry or in silver nanoclusters, representing a new category of POV condensation species. These two host&#8211;guest supramolecular anions function as templates, inducing the formation of the POV&#8208;bearing Ag0/I NCs, dubbed as Ag78 and Ag68. Furthermore, the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of Ag68 and Ag78 is comprehensively discussed and the excellent PCE is attributed to the nonradiation transition process, encompassing the fast deactivation of the excited charge transfer (CT) state and the slow recombination of CT state, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This work not only optimizes the condensation of {VOx} (x&#160;=&#160;4, 5) polyhedral building units to tailor novel host&#8211;guest POV supermolecules but also offers a new perspective on supramolecular anion templates in guiding the assembly of silver NCs.

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Driven by Efficient Nitrate Reduction via Bimetallic Iron/Zinc Polyphthalocyanine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks enable highly efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia. When integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, this reaction facilitates rapid salt ion mass transfer, allowing the conversion of natural seawater into drinkable water and simultaneously converting nitrate contaminants into a useful chemical.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity and nitrate contamination in water sources are critical environmental sustainability challenges. We address these two challenges by coupling seawater desalination with electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) via bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks. They serve as high&#8208;performance catalysts for NO3RR toward ammonia (NH3) production. The efficient NO3RR is integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, enabling the production of freshwater from seawater and the removal of nitrate from contaminated water. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that Zn&#8208;N4 units incorporated into the Fe polyphthalocyanine framework modulate Fe&#8208;N4 sites&#8217;&#160;d&#8208;band center to enhance the adsorption of NO3&#8722; and the generation of *H, resulting in 3.22 times higher turnover frequency and highly selective reduction toward NH3. The optimized Fe8Zn1PPc delivered NH3 Faradic efficiency (&gt;97% over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.95&#160;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), the NH3 yield rate of 2.68&#160;mmol h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus RHE, and over 120&#160;h of stable operation, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts for NO3RR. The desalination device achieves the highest salt removal rates (1326.92&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 min&#8722;1) among various desalination methods. Ten cycles of natural seawater desalination to drinking water are demonstrated with 99% ion removal. This work presents an innovative solution for addressing sustainable water challenges.

         <title>Noble Metal&#8208;Free Low&#8208;Temperature Aromatization of Polyethylene Waste for High&#8208;Quality Fuel Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of polyolefin cracking with the in situ generation of CH3OH via the Prins reaction enables the efficient, one&#8208;pot conversion of polyolefins into light aromatics under mild conditions, without the need for noble metals.









Abstract
The chemical recycling of waste plastics into high&#8208;quality fuels is highly attractive due to their similar chemical structures. Conventional methods like hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis, however, primarily yield alkanes with low octane numbers. This work presents a metal&#8208;free approach that converts polyethylene (PE) waste into fuels with tunable octane number (79&#8211;103) by leveraging a Prins reaction mediated low&#8208;temperature aromatization process, offering broad applicability for diverse combustion needs. By synchronizing CO hydrogenation rate with the aromatization of reactive dienes and oxygenates intermediates generated via the Prins reaction, up to 68% selectivity of light aromatics by weight was attained for octane number modification on a ZnZrO and ZSM&#8208;5 tandem catalytic system below 300&#160;&#176;C. A technical&#8208;economic analysis predicts a net post&#8208;tax profit of USD 65.3 million per year with a payback period of 3.8 years for a 200&#160;kton per year facility, providing a scalable and cost&#8208;effective pathway to upcycle polyolefins into fuels ranging from commercial gasoline (high octane) to aviation&#8208;grade compositions.

         <title>Polymerisation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly on Planar Surfaces: A New Approach for Controlling Surface Topography and Modulating Material&#8208;Bio Interactions</title>

This work investigates surface&#8208;initiated photopolymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (surface PISA) as an innovative strategy for directing nanostructure formation on planar surfaces, providing a new approach to tailoring material surface topography and achieving enhanced antifouling and antibacterial surface properties. 








Abstract
Polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has emerged as a highly efficient method for synthesising polymeric nanoparticles with diverse and well&#8208;defined morphologies for a range of applications. While extensive research has focused on solution&#8208;based PISA mediated by conformationally free macro&#8208;stabilisers, the process of PISA on planar surfaces using surface&#8208;tethered macro&#8208;stabilisers with constrained mobility, namely surface PISA, remains largely unexplored. Investigating this process is significant to further advance PISA technology and expand its applications. In this work, we explore surface PISA through both experimental and computational approaches, revealing key differences from conventional solution&#8208;based PISA. We also demonstrate that surface PISA offers an innovative approach for controlling surface topography and modulating material&#8208;bio interactions. Specifically, we showcase its versatile application in creating slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) and encapsulating antibiotics, endowing material surfaces with enhanced antifouling and antimicrobial properties. We believe this work is a significant step forward for PISA technology and will create new opportunities for its broader applications.

         <title>Design of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Ylides</title>

The norbornane&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione framework can accommodate a carbon&#8208;carbon ylide with a zwitterionic &#963;&#8208;bond. 








Abstract
Here, we have reported the computational design of a new class of ylides, elusive carbon&#8211;carbon ylides featuring zwitterionic &#963;&#8208;bonds, derived from the norbornane&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione framework. Utilizing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, we have demonstrated that appropriate substitutions on this scaffold can stabilize a carbanion at C1 and a carbocation at C7 without orbital overlap, ensuring a zwitterionic electronic structure akin to a CC&#8208;ylide. Large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps guarantee that these species do not adopt a diradical ground state. Time&#8208;dependent DFT computations further have revealed small T1&#8211;S1 energy gaps, suggesting potential applications of similar scaffolds in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Our analyses have identified the cation on C7 as the most reactive site on the molecule toward unwanted reactions, leading to the degradation of the ylides. With their unique electronic structure, CC&#8208;ylides present new opportunities for unexplored chemical reactivity and functional material design.

         <title>Electrochemical Upgrading Plastic to Organosulfurs Through Fe&#8208;N3 Single Atom Catalyst Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom catalyst embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped hollow carbon spheres enables the electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into organosulfur compounds under ambient conditions. This sustainable process achieves &gt;60% faradaic efficiency for hydroxymethanesulfonate formation, highlighting its potential in waste valorization and green carbon&#8211;sulfur (C&#9472;S) bond synthesis.








Abstract
Cycling and electrochemical upgrading of plastics present a sustainable approach to transforming waste into high&#8208;value chemicals, yet the focus has predominantly been on carbohydrate production, leaving the potential of organosulfur compounds largely unexplored. In this study, we introduced an efficient electrochemical strategy to convert polyethylene terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into organosulfur compounds with high yields. A specially designed iron single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped hollow carbon spheres (NHCS), which feature high catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;N3 motifs, was employed, which facilitates the C&#9472;C bond cleavage during EG oxidation, and generates formaldehyde (CH2O) species. These intermediates subsequently react with S&#8208;containing nucleophiles, that is, SO32&#8722;, to form hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) via C&#9472;S bond formation. Our method achieves a remarkable faradaic efficiency of over 60% and an unprecedented production rate of 1800&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 for HMS. Additionally, we validate the use of PET as feedstock for C&#9472;S bond formation, achieving a considerable faradaic efficiency of over 25% and an unprecedented production rate of 900&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Our approach promises to enhance sustainability and profitability in plastic value chain management and revolutionize the production of pharmaceuticals, textile chemicals, and agrochemicals.

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Drug Discovery of Novel High&#8208;affinity, Selective, and Anti&#8208;inflammatory Inhibitors of the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>

We developed potent and selective noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors through a structure&#8208;guided fragment&#8208;based approach. These nanomolar inhibitors activate Nrf2&#8208;controlled genes, suppress inflammation via NLRP3 and STING pathways, and exhibit distinct transcriptional profiles compared to covalent Nrf2 activators, offering promising chemical probes and drug leads for oxidative stress&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Activating the cytoprotective response of nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. A promising strategy is to inhibit the protein&#8208;protein interaction between Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Nrf2 using noncovalent compounds that target the Keap1 Kelch domain. These compounds may be more specific than covalent Keap1&#8208;reacting Nrf2 activators. However, the development of drug&#8208;like noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors faces challenges due to the size and polarity of the Kelch binding pocket. Here, we present a new series of noncovalent Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors developed from a weak fragment hit identified by crystallographic screening. A two&#8208;step growing strategy and optimization guided by several X&#8208;ray cocrystal structures led to compounds with low nanomolar affinities and complete selectivity for Keap1 in a panel of homologous Kelch domains. In cells, compounds 24 and 28 potently activated the expression of Nrf2&#8208;controlled genes and showed anti&#8208;inflammatory effects by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome and STING signalling activation. RNA sequencing revealed activation of cytoprotective pathways and a different profile from typical covalent Nrf2 activators. This work highlights the potential of fragment&#8208;based drug discovery for challenging targets like Keap1 and introduces novel Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 inhibitors as chemical probes and drug leads.

         <title>Methylthiohexa&#8208;1,3&#8208;Diene: Anionic Polymerization of a Diene with Thioether Moiety Enables Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification and Antimicrobial Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thioether&#8208;containing 6&#8208;methylthio&#8208;hexa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (MTHD) monomer is prepared from the biobased methional. The obtained isomeric cis&#8208;/trans&#8208;mixture of the diene can be successfully homo&#8208; and copolymerized via anionic techniques. Targeting the thioether groups via post&#8208;polymerization modifications (i.e. alkoxylation and alkylation) permits tailoring of the properties, for example for antimicrobial materials. 








Abstract
Anionic polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dienes is a highly established approach for the synthesis of synthetic rubber and plays a key role for thermoplastic elastomers like poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;butadiene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (SBS). Aiming at novel concepts for tailoring the property profile of synthetic rubber in post&#8208;polymerization reactions, we introduce the thioether&#8208;containing 6&#8208;methylthio&#8208;hexa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (MTHD) as a diene monomer derived from the biobased methional.

&lt;p&gt;The thioether-containing 6-methylthio-hexa-1,3-diene (MTHD) monomer is prepared from the biobased methional. The obtained isomeric cis-/trans-mixture of the diene can be successfully homo- and copolymerized via anionic techniques. Targeting the thioether groups via post-polymerization modifications (i.e. alkoxylation and alkylation) permits tailoring of the properties, for example for antimicrobial materials. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic polymerization of 1,3-dienes is a highly established approach for the synthesis of synthetic rubber and plays a key role for thermoplastic elastomers like poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-butadiene-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-styrene) (SBS). Aiming at novel concepts for tailoring the property profile of synthetic rubber in post-polymerization reactions, we introduce the thioether-containing 6-methylthio-hexa-1,3-diene (MTHD) as a diene monomer derived from the biobased methional. The obtained isomeric cis-/trans-mixture was successfully polymerized via anionic techniques. In situ &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) kinetics revealed different reactivities of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-isomer and dispersities of &#393;&#160;=&#160;1.21&#8211;1.35. Copolymerization with isoprene afforded a series of well-defined statistical copolymers with molar masses up to 50&#160;kg&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, permitting precise adjustment of MTHD content from 2% to 10%. These copolymers exhibited moderate to narrow distributions (&#393;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;1.19). Targeting the thioether groups via post-polymerization modifications (i.e., alkoxylation and alkylation) permitted tailoring of the properties of the diene-based copolymers. The respective sulfoxide was obtained selectively by mild oxidation and represents an internal antioxidant group.

         <title>Manipulating Competitive Li+ Coordination of F&#8208;Rich Polymer and High Flash Point Glyme Electrolyte Enabling High Rate and Intrinsically Safe Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the deconstruction strategy of a solvation cage for PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes, we adopted the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms within the in situ polymerizing trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) matrix and Li+ in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries to disrupt the tight tetraglyme (G4)&#8208;Li+ chelating effect. Subsequently, the Li+&#8208;transport behavior and cycle performance at a high rate have been effectively improved. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based batteries incorporating quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes (QSEs) represent a promising approach to attain both high safety and high energy density. Nevertheless, the issues of limited ionic conductivity and insufficient solid&#8211;solid contact interfaces significantly impede their practical applications. In this study, an intrinsically safe QSE synthesized by in situ polymerizing trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) in high flash point tetraglyme (G4)&#8208;based electrolyte is developed. Owing to the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms within the polymer matrix and Li+, solvation cage caused by the &#8220;chelating&#8221; effect between Li+ and solvent molecules is disrupted. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that a solvated structure predominantly characterized by the contact ion pair is formed. Therefore, a robust solid electrolyte interface enriched with anion&#8208;derived LiF&#8208; and B&#8208;species is constructed. As a result, matched with a commercial&#8208;level loading LiFePO4 cathode, a capacity retention of 92.7% is obtained even after 200 cycles. These results elucidate the polymer matrix's pivotal role in QSEs, offering novel pathway for designing advanced quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, such as Li/Na/K/Mg/Ca et&#160;al.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Diboronates via 1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement</title>

We report a strategy using alkenyl thianthrenium salts and gem&#8208;diborylalkanes for the efficient stereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. This method features broad substrate scope, high yields, and excellent diastereoselectivity. The protocol is scalable, allowing both diverse downstream derivatization and efficient preparation of cyclopropane&#8208;containing pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8211;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;diboronate substituted cyclopropanes in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and synthesis.

         <title>Social Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting Synthesis of [9]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Pillar[5]arene Heterochiral Multicavity Macrocyclic Trimers with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a stereochemically controlled synthesis of [9]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;pillar[5]arene trimers using a social chiral self&#8208;sorting strategy with a triangular gold complex. This selective synthesis is attributed to the dynamic reorganization of Au&#9472;C &#963;&#8208;bonds, specific conformations of phosphine ligands, and inter&#8208;pillararene interactions.








Abstract
The precise synthesis of stereochemically controlled multicavity macrocyclic hosts based on pillar[n]arenes presents a significant challenge in supramolecular chemistry. This difficulty primarily stems from the spontaneous generation of planar chirality&#8208;induced stereoisomer mixtures during synthetic procedures, which considerably complicates the isolation process. In this study, we introduce a social chiral self&#8208;sorting strategy utilizing a triangular gold complex, enabling the stereochemically controlled synthesis of [9]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;pillar[5]arene trimers ([9]CPP&#8208;3P[5]A). Diverging from conventional synthetic approaches that typically yield four stereoisomers of pillararene trimers (pSSS, pRRR, pSSR, and pRRS), our methodology demonstrates selectivity, predominantly generating pSSR and pRRS isomers of [9]CPP&#8208;3P[5]A, with only trace amounts of pSSS and pRRR isomers. This stereoselectivity, as elucidated by crystallographic analysis, arises from the dynamic reorganization of Au&#9472;C &#963;&#8208;bonds during the assembly of the hexagold(I) complex, synergistically combined with specific phosphine ligand conformations and inter&#8208;pillararene interactions. The resulting chiral trimers exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, which facilitates the fabrication of CPL&#8208;active supramolecular polymers by leveraging the superior host&#8211;guest complexation capability of the pillar[5]arene units, opening new avenues for the development of chiral functional materials.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Inert Coinage Metal Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;inert coinage metal cluster scintillator with excellent water&#8211;oxygen stability and thermal stability was developed, which was successfully used in temperature&#8208;independent high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, and the resolution at different temperatures was maintained above 20&#160;LP&#160;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Scintillators can convert high&#8208;energy ionizing radiation, such as X&#8208;ray, into low&#8208;energy ultraviolet&#8208;visible photons, and they have been widely used in various fields. However, like most luminogens, the emission intensity of a scintillator is usually influenced by the environmental temperature, increasing the temperature results in extreme decreases in radioluminescence. Here, a temperature&#8208;inert coinage metal cluster scintillator of Cu4S was prepared, and it exhibited not only intense radioluminescence at room temperature but also minimal fluctuations from 80 to 450&#160;K. Mechanism study revealed that Cu4S is a typical thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminogen.

&lt;p&gt;A temperature-inert coinage metal cluster scintillator with excellent water&#8211;oxygen stability and thermal stability was developed, which was successfully used in temperature-independent high-resolution X-ray imaging, and the resolution at different temperatures was maintained above 20&#160;LP&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scintillators can convert high-energy ionizing radiation, such as X-ray, into low-energy ultraviolet-visible photons, and they have been widely used in various fields. However, like most luminogens, the emission intensity of a scintillator is usually influenced by the environmental temperature, increasing the temperature results in extreme decreases in radioluminescence. Here, a temperature-inert coinage metal cluster scintillator of &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; was prepared, and it exhibited not only intense radioluminescence at room temperature but also minimal fluctuations from 80 to 450&#160;K. Mechanism study revealed that &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; is a typical thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminogen. Owing to the strong C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; interactions between the clusters, the geometric relaxation of &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; was restricted during the spin crossover process, leading to an exceptionally small reorganization energy. This induced intersystem crossing within the Marcus inverted region, resulting in temperature-independent luminescence behavior. More importantly, &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; metal cluster has excellent water&#8210;oxygen stability and thermal stability and can be used to prepare flexible scintillator screen with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). On the basis of these features, temperature-independent high-resolution X-ray imaging with the &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;-PDMS scintillator screen was achieved, and the resolution at different temperatures was maintained above 20&#160;LP&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Lithium Storage of SrGe2O4S Anode Enabled by In Situ Formed Oxysulfide Matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SrGe2O4S anode demonstrates ultralong cycling stability. In situ formed Li2O/SrS oxysulfide matrix in SrGe2O4S effectively prevents agglomeration of Ge nanodots during cycling, facilitated by pinning effect of Sr2+ and the enhanced polarity of S2&#8722;.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) demand next&#8208;generation alloying&#8208;type anodes with high capacity and low voltage. While silicon&#8208;based anodes are in industrial use, commercial alloying&#8208;type anodes still suffer from excessive volume expansion and inadequate cycle life. Even incorporating silicon&#8208;carbon composites within graphite (typically &lt;20% in commercial products) fails to resolve these limitations. Herein, we report a novel SrGe2O4S anode for ultralong&#8208;cycling lithium storage. An oxysulfide matrix (Li&#8322;O/SrS) was in situ formed around Ge nanodomains. Enabled by the strong covalency of soft S2&#8315; anions and the pinning effect of large Sr2&#8314; ions, this synergistic matrix has demonstrated capabilities to enhance interfacial compatibility with Ge, facilitate efficient Li&#8314; transport, suppress agglomeration of Ge nanoparticles and buffer volume expansion, as evidenced by in/ex situ characterizations, density functional theory calculations, and finite element analysis simulations. The anode harvests a low charging medium voltage of 0.42&#160;V and reversible capacity of 587&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles (8300&#160;h) with 93.2% capacity retention. The LiCoO2||SrGe2O4S full cell delivers a high capacity of 142&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and energy density of 482&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on constructing functional matrix to relieve volume expansion and particle agglomeration of high&#8208;capacity ultralong&#8208;cycling alloying&#8208;type anodes.

         <title>Electrochemical Deoxygenative Silylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, electroreductive deoxysilylation of benzylic and allylic alcohols is demonstrated. The cathodic transformation proceeds via carbanionic intermediates and can be extended to aldehydes and ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction outcome is dependent on the thermodynamics and kinetics for the coupling step in combination with the reductive stability of the coupling partner, thereby supporting a unified mechanism to that of deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling with CO2 as electrophile.








Abstract
Alcohols are highly common organic compounds but remain scarce as alkyl donors in synthetic procedures. Here, we describe an electrochemical procedure for their deoxygenative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with hydrosilanes, furnishing organosilane products in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the operating pathways of this semi&#8208;paired electrolytic transformation, suggesting that silyl ethers are likely reaction intermediates. Furthermore, a unified mechanistic proposal is presented that accounts for observed reactivity differences with analogous deoxygenative electrocarboxylation.

         <title>Selective Cascade Metathesis Polymerization of Dicycloalkenes and Their Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly selective CMP of dicycloalkenes using G2 catalysts, obtaining well&#8208;defined polymer structures with excellent cascade efficiency (&gt;99%) and TON up to 3550. Sulfonamide&#8208;linked dicycloalkenes undergo intramolecular cascade transformation to new bicycles which then produce high Mn polymers (up to 141&#160;kDa) via ROMP. Remarkably, these well&#8208;defined polymers enable selective depolymerization thereby achieving closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling.








Abstract
Cascade metathesis polymerization (CMP) offers a powerful route to complex yet precise polymer microstructures. However, achieving both high cascade selectivity and polymerization efficiency remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report our efforts to enhance cascade efficiency (CE) in CMP of various dicycloalkenes and explore their closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling. A comprehensive investigation revealed that second&#8208;generation Grubbs catalysts (G2 and DIPP&#8208;G2) exhibited superior cascade selectivity (CE up to &gt;99%) and polymerization efficiency (turnover numbers up to 3550) compared to first&#8208;generation Grubbs catalyst (G1). This is attributed to a preferred intramolecular cascade pathway that suppresses competing ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Polymers with high CE showed markedly improved glass transition temperatures (Tg), by up to 47&#160;&#176;C. Remarkably, in&#8208;depth studies on sulfonamide&#8208;based dicycloalkenes uncovered an unexpected intramolecular cascade transformation, forming new bicyclic monomers, which underwent ROMP and yielded highmolecular&#8208;weight polymers (Mn up to 141&#160;kDa). Importantly, these well&#8208;defined polymers underwent selective and complete depolymerization into small molecules via reverse CMP or ROMP, which then were repolymerized thereby achieving closed&#8208;loop recycling. Computational studies explained how these small molecules were preferentially formed. Overall, this work underscores the potential of our insights (understanding the detailed mechanistic pathways of CMP transformation depending on catalysts and monomer structures) toward sustainable chemical recycling.

         <title>Reversing Pt/C Degradation Via Ni(OH)2&#8208;Wrapping Induced Spreading of Electric Field for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In electrocatalysis, the interfacial electron transfer driving the catalyst modulates the interfacial charge distribution, and the resulting interfacial electric field regulates the structure of the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), which directly affects the performance and stability of the catalyst. With the undifferentiated adsorption induced by the dispersion of the interfacial electric field, the activity and stability of the catalyst were significantly enhanced.








Abstract
Low mass activity due to unfavorable water dissociation and insufficient stability are two primary challenges for Pt catalysts. Herein, we find that the specific adsorption of solvent molecules in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) leads to local environmental degradation in the Pt/C catalyst. So, we propose an encapsulation&#8208;confined strategy, by which a poriferous Ni(OH)2 on Pt nanocages (thereafter Pt/Ni(OH)2) was spatially wrapped to regulate charge transfer. As the heterogeneous interface enables spreading the surface electric field, the wrapped Ni(OH)2 layer not only optimizes the proton&#8208;coupled electron dynamics but also stabilizes the Pt sites via undifferentiated adsorption of solvent molecules in the IHP, as demonstrated by using identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL&#8208;TEM). Consequently, the Pt/Ni(OH)2 (11.85&#160;mA/mgPt at an overpotential of 70&#160;mV) achieves an excellent mass activity of 12.74 times higher than the commercial Pt/C and long&#8208;term durability in 1&#160;M KOH. Our work has gained insights into the architecture of microenvironments&#8208;involved interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;In electrocatalysis, the interfacial electron transfer driving the catalyst modulates the interfacial charge distribution, and the resulting interfacial electric field regulates the structure of the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), which directly affects the performance and stability of the catalyst. With the undifferentiated adsorption induced by the dispersion of the interfacial electric field, the activity and stability of the catalyst were significantly enhanced.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low mass activity due to unfavorable water dissociation and insufficient stability are two primary challenges for Pt catalysts. Herein, we find that the specific adsorption of solvent molecules in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) leads to local environmental degradation in the Pt/C catalyst. So, we propose an encapsulation-confined strategy, by which a poriferous Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Pt nanocages (thereafter Pt/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was spatially wrapped to regulate charge transfer. As the heterogeneous interface enables spreading the surface electric field, the wrapped Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer not only optimizes the proton-coupled electron dynamics but also stabilizes the Pt sites via undifferentiated adsorption of solvent molecules in the IHP, as demonstrated by using identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM). Consequently, the Pt/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (11.85&#160;mA/mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt; at an overpotential of 70&#160;mV) achieves an excellent mass activity of 12.74 times higher than the commercial Pt/C and long-term durability in 1&#160;M KOH. Our work has gained insights into the architecture of microenvironments-involved interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Aza&#8208;Helicene Phosphonic Acids for Stabilizing Efficient Perovskite&#8208;Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Stacking of intrinsic stable chiral aza&#8208;helicene phosphonic acid self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs), P and M enantiomers of A7HPA, leads to reinforced intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions to rigidify the hole transport layer. Consequently, the A7HPA&#8208;based monolithic wide bandgap perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cell exhibits excellent performance.








Abstract
The popular planar carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suffered from intrinsic instability toward electric potential, heat, and light illumination. To address this issue, herein, we report a kind of chiral helically shaped SAM, aza&#8208;helicene phosphonic acid A5HPA, and A7HPA, featuring their self&#8208;assembly attributed to the extended nonplanar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of aza&#8208;helicene with highly intrinsic stability toward thermal aging, light soaking, and electrical oxidation. Due to the increased torsion degree of the helicene backbone and the improved helical chiral molecular self&#8208;consistency, P and M enantiomers of A7HPA molecules tend to stack in an alternating pattern similar to &#8220;gear mesh,&#8221; leading to reinforced intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and conjugation effect to rigidify the hole transport layer. Consequently, the A7HPA&#8208;based single&#8208;junction wide bandgap PSC and perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cell exhibited impressive long&#8208;term stability under both damp&#8208;heat and light&#8208;thermal synergetic stress tests and provided 23.41% and 33.06% (certified as 32.57%) power conversion efficiencies, respectively.

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Controlled Radical Dopants: Suppressing Unpredictable Oxidation and Lithium Migration in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;triggered radical&#8208;generating dopant strategy using triphenylsulfonium salts for perovskite solar cells is presented. This approach enhances hole mobility fourfold and optimizes energy level alignment, achieving 25.18% efficiency and retaining 90% efficiency after 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved parity in efficiency with silicon&#8208;based solar cells. This dependency introduces stability challenges and complicates device fabrication due to the traditional air&#8208;oxidation doping process, which is time&#8208;consuming, unpredictable, and requires continuous monitoring of device variability. Here, we propose two triphenyl sulfonium (TPS) salts as UV&#8208;light&#8208;triggered radical&#8208;generating dopants for 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis [N,N&#8208;di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) amino]&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene(spiro&#8208;OMeTAD). These dopants eliminate the need for air&#8208;based oxidation, thereby simplifying fabrication while enhancing the electrical properties of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD through efficient p&#8208;type doping. Using this approach, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.18%, surpassing the performance of traditional doping methods. Notably, PSCs incorporating TPS dopants and cost&#8208;effective silver top&#8208;electrodes demonstrated exceptional stability under various operational conditions. This work presents a scalable, cost&#8208;effective doping strategy that addresses critical stability&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;offs in PSCs, positioning them as viable contenders for commercial renewable energy applications.

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis Through D&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To excite electrons bound in d&#8208;band of Pt under light and thus exhibit photocatalysis function, the colloidosomes structure are designed and fabricated for light confinement. Non&#8208;photoresponsive Pt can be optically excited to generate hot electrons from its d&#8208;band structure and exhibit light&#8208;enhanced catalytic activity. NIR excited hot electrons in Pt colloidosomes can enhance the cascade catalysis efficiency of Pt as nanozymes for tumor therapy.








Abstract
Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by finite&#8208;different&#8208;time&#8208;domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100&#160;nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5&#160;nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.

         <title>Neuropeptides in the Extracellular Space of the Mouse Cortex Measured In Vivo by Nanodialysis Probe Coupled with LC&#8208;MS</title>

This study reveals a complex peptidomic landscape in the mouse somatosensory cortex, identifying locally released and potentially transported neuropeptides using a membrane&#8208;free nanodialysis sampling probe coupled with nanoLC&#8208;timsTOF mass spectrometry.








Abstract
Neuropeptides are key neuromodulators in the central nervous system that shape sensory processing, yet their extracellular dynamics in the somatosensory cortex (S1) remain poorly understood. This study applies an innovative membrane&#8208;free silicon nanodialysis (ND) probe coupled with liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) to analyze the extracellular neuropeptidome in the mouse S1 with spatial resolution down to 100&#160;&#181;m. Localized in vivo sampling identified extracellular peptides from secretogranin&#8208;1, ProSAAS, pro&#8208;opiomelanocortin (POMC), and others. Minimal tissue damage, enabled by probe dimensions of 75&#160;&#215;&#160;15 &#181;m2, resulted in an absence of structural peptides in the dialysate indicating low intracellular contamination. Many detected secretory peptides correlated with strong local mRNA expression; however, the detection of POMC&#8208;derived peptides, despite negligible local expression, suggests long&#8208;distance peptide transport or extracellular processing. To expand peptide identification, a discovery&#8208;to&#8208;targeted peptidomic approach was developed, revealing 46 peptides from 24 proteins in dialysate samples, including 10 proteins with low local expression. Complementary S1 tissue analysis confirmed POMC peptides and showed that 17% of 304 prohormone&#8208;derived peptides had low local expression. These results uncover a complex extracellular peptide landscape shaped by both local and long&#8208;distance signaling. By overcoming the limitations of traditional microdialysis, this approach advances the understanding of neuropeptide signaling in cortical function.

To expand peptide identification, a discovery-to-targeted peptidomic approach was developed, revealing 46 peptides from 24 proteins in dialysate samples, including 10 proteins with low local expression. Complementary S1 tissue analysis confirmed POMC peptides and showed that 17% of 304 prohormone-derived peptides had low local expression. These results uncover a complex extracellular peptide landscape shaped by both local and long-distance signaling. By overcoming the limitations of traditional microdialysis, this approach advances the understanding of neuropeptide signaling in cortical function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triple&#8208;Anion Coordination Design for Tuning Li+ Transport Energy Barrier and Promoting the Performance of Li&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

The triple&#8208;anion coordination design, featuring a broad and dense &#8220;energy band&#8221;, effectively tamed solvent reactivity and generated a robust rigid&#8208;soft coupled interfacial layer at the phosphorus (P) anode through the NO3&#8722;&#8208;FSI&#8722;&#8208;TFSI&#8722; adsorption&#8208;decomposition&#8208;sustained release cooperative mechanism.








Abstract
The complex phase transitions of lithiated phosphorus (P)&#160;species&#8208;derived interfacial side reactions can be substantially mitigated through a triple&#8208;anion coordination design within the solvation sheath. Our results indicate that the triple&#8208;anion electrolyte exhibits an expanded energy level distribution of solvation sheaths, a low barrier for migrating Li+ solvation sheath, a high Li+&#8208;anion coordination number, a low Li+&#8208;ether solvent coordination number and an effective NO3&#8722;&#8208;FSI&#8722;&#8208;TFSI&#8722; adsorption&#8208;decomposition&#8208;sustained release cooperative mechanism that generates a robust rigid&#8208;soft coupled SEI layer during the cycling process. When coupled with a LiFePO4 cathode, the full cell utilizing the triple&#8208;anion ether electrolyte demonstrates superior stability compared to cells using commercial LiPF6&#8208;EC/DEC electrolytes. More importantly, we establish a universal principle governing P/ether electrolyte compatibility, driven by anion&#8208;rich configurations: a higher Li+&#8208;FSI&#8722; coordination number and a lower Li+&#8208;solvent coordination number in the triple&#8208;anion electrolyte not only broaden the electrochemical window but also enable a remarkable 94% capacity retention at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles for P&#8208;based NCM523 full cells.

         <dc:description>
Interface management in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), encompassing mitigation of carrier transport barriers and suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination, remains essential for enhancing efficiency and stability. In this study, two small dipole&#8208;functionalized molecules, Ph&#8208;T and Ph&#8208;Tz, were synthesized to effectively improve the quality of perovskite grain boundaries and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. The optimal n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieved a champion efficiency of 25.85% alongside enhanced operational stability.








Abstract
The modification of interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to achieve mitigation of carrier transport barriers and suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination is essential for enhancing PSC efficiency and stability. In this study, two small dipole&#8208;functionalized molecules, 1,4&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene and 1,4&#8208;di(thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene, were synthesized and effectively anchored onto perovskite surfaces via Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions to improve the quality of perovskite grain boundaries and reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination. The dual&#8208;passivation&#8208;site dipole&#8208;functionalized molecules strategically modulate the interfaces, establishing a gradient energy level alignment, that facilitates carrier extraction and transport. As a result, the optimal n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSC achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.85% alongside enhanced operational stability under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination over 1200&#160;h. A large&#8208;area device with an area of 1 cm2 also exhibited a PCE of 24.79%. Our study provides fundamental insights into the role of dipole molecules in defect passivation for further development of interfacial engineering strategies for high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronic devices.

An efficient and versatile metallaphotoredox catalyst system has been developed to promote highly selective C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile couplings of aryl chlorides and alkyl halides. The design and development of a unique PyIm ligand was crucial in tuning the reactivity of the less reactive aryl chlorides. The strength of the protocol has been demonstrated through peptide diversification and direct functionalization of drugs, such as fenofibrate, indomethacin, and etoricoxib.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reactions that forge C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds have received considerable attention due to the vast libraries of commercially available organohalides. However, the incorporation of ubiquitous aryl chlorides remains a challenge due to the slow rate of oxidative addition of metal catalysts to these electrophiles relative to iodide and bromide derivatives. This study reports a simple metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) method for the selective coupling of a broad range of aryl chlorides and alkyl halides. By design, this methodology exploits the enabling interplay of a bidentate 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligand, incorporating the strong &#963;&#8208;donor capacity of a 1H&#8208;imidazole moiety with the moderate &#960;&#8208;acceptor capacity of a pyridine unit. The synergy provided by these modular components allowed for the electronic requirements of elementary steps to be accommodated, such as the synchronous integration of alkyl radical generation (typically relatively fast) and oxidative addition of low valent nickel species to aryl chlorides (often relatively slow). This protocol enabled the efficient late&#8208;stage diversification of the drugs Me&#8208;fenofibrate, indomethacin, and etoricoxib to enhance their sp3&#8208;rich complexity. Using an equimolar ratio of substrates, this methodology facilitated a decagram XEC in continuous flow, showcasing the applicability of the method for large scale synthesis.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Unprotected Sulfonimidamides and Their Application in Photochemical Nitrene Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, metal&#8208;free nitrene transfer enables the efficient synthesis of unprotected sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and hydroxylamine&#8208;derived reagents, offering broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and access to complex sulfur&#8211;nitrogen scaffolds.








Abstract
The selective incorporation of nitrogen into organic molecules remains a central challenge in modern synthetic chemistry, particularly when aiming to access complex, functionalized scaffolds under mild and sustainable conditions. In this report, we describe a photocatalytic method that employs hydroxylamine&#8208;derived nitrene precursors and unprotected sulfinamides under mild conditions, enabling efficient nitrene transfer without the need for stoichiometric amounts of an oxidant. The resulting unprotected sulfonimidamides serve not only as target compounds but also as versatile intermediates for further nitrene&#8208;transfer reactions, affording complex sulfur&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;rich frameworks. Mechanistic studies support a photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer process involving a reactant complex between the photocatalyst and nitrene precursor. This work establishes a general and modular platform for accessing challenging architectures based on sulfonimidamides, expanding the toolkit for late&#8208;stage functionalization and heteroatom&#8208;rich molecule construction.

         <title>Deoxygenative Functionalization of Alcohols and Carbonyl Compounds via Electrochemical Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the abundance of oxygen&#8208;containing molecules, no unified approach exists that can activate various oxidation states of oxygenated functional groups for deoxygnenative functionalization. Here, we disclose a tandem, one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation&#8211;electroreduction sequence that enables the conversion of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and esters into nucleophilic reagents widely used in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups are prevalent motifs in natural products and feedstock chemicals, but direct methods for their deoxygenative transformation remain rare due to the difficult cleavage of the strong C&#8211;O bond. Here, we develop a general activation strategy that employs hydrosilanes as activating reagents for alcohols, carbonyls, and esters to afford a common silyl ether intermediate. Electrochemical reduction of the in situ generated silyl ether results in C&#8211;O cleavage to afford a carbanion, which reacts with a number of electrophiles for the construction of C&#8211;Si, C&#8211;B, C&#8211;Ge, and C&#8211;Sn bonds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Gated Amine Exchange in Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating aniline&#8208;type diarylethenes as core&#8208;enriched crosslinkers in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) based microgels enables photomodulation of their responsivity towards temperature and pH as well as covalent binding and release of functional amines via light&#8208;gated amine exchange reaction. This study highlights the potential of photoswitchable microgels for smart biomedical materials.








Abstract
The functionalization of microgels with photoswitchable moieties enables the construction of multi&#8208;responsive systems, which are highly interesting for biological applications, for example, in drug delivery. Controlling the reversible uptake of functional molecules, however, remains a major challenge. To address this, we developed a novel aniline&#8208;type diarylethene (DAE) crosslinker and prepared a series of corresponding poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam)&#8208;based microgels with varying degrees of DAE crosslinker. Upon UV light irradiation, the aniline (and thus enamine) motif of the DAE is converted to its imine form, thus allowing for reversible exchange with primary amines. Irradiating the DAE with blue light covalently locks the equilibrium and traps the amine in the microgels. The light&#8208;controlled covalent binding of fluorinated, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic amine derivatives was proven by dynamic light scattering and 19F NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, the impact of photoisomerization and amine binding on microgel properties was investigated and we were able to remotely control size as well as temperature and pH responsiveness by light. Overall, this study demonstrates optically gated uptake and release of functional amines in multi&#8208;responsive microgels and highlights their potential biological applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Long&#8208;Term Cycling Capability of Lithium Batteries Enabled by Releasing Local Constriction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the failure mechanism in sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries with Si anodes at high temperatures, where insufficient Li&#8208;ion diffusion leads to creep phase formation, triggering Li dendrite growth and aggravated interfacial side reactions. A GaP&#8208;doped and cPAN&#8208;coated Si anode is proposed, enabling stable battery operation at 120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Reusable interstellar exploration and commercial spaceflight urgently require the development of high&#8208;temperature secondary battery technology. However, metal/semimetal anodes contributing to high theoretical capacity are prone to creep at high temperatures, which raises&#160;significant concerns about battery safety and cycling performance. Here, we identify the generation of Li&#8208;rich phases at anodes that leads to the sustained degradation of high&#8208;temperature batteries. The non&#8208;conformal interface between anode and electrolyte constricts lithiation in local contact areas, resulting in extremely low chemical potential and subsequent evolution of high temperature unstable Li&#8208;rich phases. We therefore designed a heat&#8208;resistant anode featuring a Zintl&#8208;like phase core and an ion&#8208;electron co&#8208;conducting conformal coating, which releases local constriction while inhibiting high&#8208;temperature interfacial deactivation. Consequently, solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) assembled with this designed anode can stably cycle over 1,000 cycles at 120&#160;&#176;C (2C, pouch cell&#8208;340&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). Particularly distinguishing itself from molten salt high&#8208;temperature batteries, the SSB exhibits outstanding temperature adaptability in full&#8208;temperature dynamic tests (&#8722;40&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Direct Production of Cyclohexanones from Lignin via Chlorine&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Hydroprocessing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;modified ZrO2 supported Pd catalyst (Pd&#8208;Cl/ZrO2) has been designed and exhibited remarkable selectivity in the one&#8208;step catalytic hydroprocessing of lignin monomer oil and its model compound guaiacol to cyclohexanones under optimized conditions (200&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C, 2&#160;MPa H2, 430&#160;ppm HCl), achieving a cyclohexanones yield of 34.3&#160;wt%.








Abstract
Cyclohexanones, as critical biopolymer precursors, could be produced from lignin yet rarely reported due to the formidable challenge of simultaneously removing oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxyl) and achieving selective C&#9552;O bond retention during catalytic hydrogenation. Herein, we demonstrate a chlorine&#8208;modified ZrO2 supported Pd catalyst (Pd&#8208;Cl/ZrO2) efficiently converting lignin to cyclohexanones under optimized reaction conditions, based on poplar RCF (reductive catalytic fractionation) lignin oil. Notably, the addition of trace HCl enables the catalytic process to proceed under milder conditions (200&#160;&#176;C), achieving a cyclohexanones yield of 34.3&#160;wt% (relative to lignin content in poplar biomass). The acidity (H&#8314;) from HCl promotes dehydroxylation of lignin oil. Moreover, studies on model compound guaiacol reveal that Cl species may partially block Pd to suppress aromatic ring hydrogenation and promote electron transfer from Pd to the ZrO2 support, collectively promoting ketone yield. This study presents a novel catalytic approach for the efficient and selective conversion of lignin, advancing biorefineries toward the direct synthesis of ketone derivatives.

         <title>Promoting Ampere&#8208;Level Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Through Strong Oxide&#8211;Oxide Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly efficient oxide&#8211;oxide catalytic system fabricated by coupling Co3O4 nanoparticles with CuO nanosheets for the electrochemical reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. The NH3 Faradaic efficiencies of CuO and Co3O4 are significantly optimized through the strong oxide&#8211;oxide interface between the two components. Consequently, nitrate can be effectively converted into NH3 at an ampere&#8208;level current density.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate to value&#8208;added ammonia offers a promising approach for removing nitrate pollutants from wastewater, combining energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability. However, developing industrially viable catalysts that combine high efficiency, low&#8208;cost, and high durability remains a significant challenge. Herein, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles are anchored onto the copper oxide (CuO) nanosheets support (Co3O4@CuO) to boost the electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia via a strong oxide&#8211;oxide interaction. The optimized Co3O4@CuO catalyst exhibits a superb nitrate reduction performance, including a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% at an ampere&#8208;level current density of approximately 2500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the strong oxide&#8211;oxide interaction between Co3O4 and CuO regulates the adsorption configuration of nitrite and the subsequent hydrogenation process. This interaction can effectively control the overall reaction pathway, thereby enhancing the yield and selectivity of ammonia. The strategic combination of these oxide materials provides a guiding framework for developing high&#8208;performance catalytic systems.

&lt;p&gt;We report a highly efficient oxide&#8211;oxide catalytic system fabricated by coupling Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles with CuO nanosheets for the electrochemical reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiencies of CuO and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are significantly optimized through the strong oxide&#8211;oxide interface between the two components. Consequently, nitrate can be effectively converted into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at an ampere-level current density.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical reduction of nitrate to value-added ammonia offers a promising approach for removing nitrate pollutants from wastewater, combining energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability. However, developing industrially viable catalysts that combine high efficiency, low-cost, and high durability remains a significant challenge. Herein, cobalt oxide (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles are anchored onto the copper oxide (CuO) nanosheets support (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CuO) to boost the electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia via a strong oxide&#8211;oxide interaction. The optimized Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CuO catalyst exhibits a superb nitrate reduction performance, including a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% at an ampere-level current density of approximately 2500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the strong oxide&#8211;oxide interaction between Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CuO regulates the adsorption configuration of nitrite and the subsequent hydrogenation process. This interaction can effectively control the overall reaction pathway, thereby enhancing the yield and selectivity of ammonia.

A bioinspired peptide&#8208;phosphonium salt (PPS) catalytic system enables efficient desymmetrization of prochiral phosphinic acids under ambient, metal&#8208;free conditions, establishing a versatile platform for constructing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic architectures. It features a modular two&#8208;stage protocol transforms the stereodefined P(V) building blocks into structurally diverse phosphinate esters and tertiary phosphine oxides with &gt;99% ee stereofidelity. Moreover, comprehensive mechanistic investigations reveal the chiral microenvironment within the PPS catalyst orchestrates stereochemical control via synergistic hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic steering effects.








Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral phosphorus(V) compounds represents a pivotal strategy for constructing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic skeletons, yet existing methods face limitations in structural diversification and metal&#8208;free catalytic systems. Here we disclose that a bioinspired peptide&#8208;phosphonium salt (PPS) catalytic system successfully enables precise desymmetrization of phosphinic acids through synergistic ion&#8208;pairing and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. This strategy affords multifunctional platform molecules bearing P(V)&#8208;stereocenters with excellent enantiocontrol and broad compatibility (43 examples, up to 92% yield, up to &gt;99% ee) at very low catalyst loading (1 mol%). Furthermore, the P(V)&#8208;chiral building blocks undergo stereospecific derivatization to access structurally diverse phosphinates (27 examples, up to 75% yield, up to &gt;99% ee) and tertiary phosphine oxides (10 examples). Mechanistic studies reveal that the stereochemical origin is from a semi&#8208;enclosed chiral cavity, where dynamic electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions synergistically orchestrate the stereodetermining transition state. The two&#8208;stage desymmetrization&#8211;derivatization process establishes a versatile platform for modular synthesis of valuable P(V)&#8208;stereogenic pharmaceuticals and functional molecules.

         <title>Switching&#8208;Off to Switching&#8208;On Triplet Formation Through Singlet&#8211;Triplet Intersystem Crossing in Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reminiscent of natural LHC arrays, excitonic coupling in FB&#8208;porphyrin MOFs produces multi&#8208;strut&#8208;spanned singlet excitons compared to localized triplets, resulting in a small SOC matrix element that prevents triplet formation through ISC. This can be activated by a higher Zeff in Pd&#8208;porphyrin MOFs. The triplet dynamics in Pd&#8208;MOFs are governed by the topology, which determines the extent and efficiency of the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation process.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state artificial photosystems need precise control over their singlet or triplet excited states to enable desired photochemical transformations. While persistent triplets are often selected to drive chemical bond formation or spin&#8208;specific photoreactions, singlets can allow for ambient applications. Among different heterogeneous systems, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a solution&#8208;stable platform with many benefits, including large chemically accessible interior surfaces where excitons can be transferred from their original formation sites. Porphyrins demonstrate high intersystem crossing efficiency, with QYISC&#160;&#8776;&#160;80% for free&#8208;base (FB) cores, which can be increased to about 92% for palladium&#8208;metalated cores. This study shows that framework assembly prevents ISC in FB&#8208;MOFs; whereas, ISC is enhanced in Pd&#8208;MOFs compared to monomeric linkers. The MOF topology influences the excited state dynamics, resulting in short&#8208;lived triplets with &#964;0.5 &#8818;10&#160;ps in microporous MOFs. This extensive control over QYISC (from 0 to approximately 100%) and triplet behavior through framework assembly offers new design principles for creating artificial photosystems that operate exclusively in their singlet or triplet states manifold.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Decrypted Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting in Chirality&#8208;Driven Supramolecular System</title>

         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive groups have been used to photo&#8208;decrypt the narcissistic self&#8208;sorting phenomenon. The inherent chirality of each component (homochiral or heterochiral) dictated the chirality&#8208;dependent assembly behaviors, leading to either social or narcissistic self&#8208;sorting. Photoirradiation triggered the formation of narcissistically self&#8208;sorted nanokebab nanostructures, which facilitated its direct visualization at the nanoscale. 








Abstract
Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is crucial in biological systems, but achieving precise control over chiral narcissistic or social self&#8208;sorting as well as the distinction between them remains a major challenge in multicomponent supramolecular systems. To investigate chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, two classes of chiral building blocks, photo&#8208;responsive (cinnamic glutamide derivative, L/D&#8208;CG) and fluorescent molecules (dansyl glutamide derivative, L/D&#8208;DNSG), were designed and integrated into homochiral systems (L&#8208;CG/L&#8208;DNSG or D&#8208;CG/D&#8208;DNSG) and heterochiral systems (L&#8208;CG/D&#8208;DNSG or D&#8208;CG/L&#8208;DNSG). Either homo&#8208; or heterochiral systems could form organogels with fibrous structures. Upon photoirradiation, the homochiral systems remained stable, whereas the heterochiral systems underwent a significant transformation from uniform organogels to suspensions, in which nanokebab structures appeared. The results demonstrate that social self&#8208;sorting dominates in the homochiral systems while narcissistic self&#8208;sorting prevails in the heterochiral systems. Remarkably, the difference between homochiral and heterochiral systems is magnified through photodimerization. Various characterizations and simulations unveil the underlying homo&#8208; and heterochiral interactions that drive narcissistic self&#8208;sorting from the molecular to hierarchical nanoscale levels. This work decrypts the narcissistic or social self&#8208;sorting behavior in chirality&#8208;driven supramolecular systems through photoirradiation and provides a new perspective for understanding the regulation of chiral&#8208;driven functions in biological or material systems.

         <title>Polysulfamates as &#8220;Macroisosteres&#8221; of Polyurethanes with Improved Degradability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the synthesis of polysulfamates&#8212;sulfur(VI) isomeric analogs of polyurethanes in which the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in the repeating unit is replaced by a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO2&#8211;). Analysis of these polyurethane &#8220;macroisosteres&#8221; revealed enhanced hydrolytic degradability, improved thermal stability, and retained mechanical properties.








Abstract
Addressing the environmental persistence of plastics requires the development of next&#8208;generation polymers that combine high performance with enhanced degradability. Progress toward this grand challenge has been impeded, in part, by the absence of a general blueprint for the macromolecular design of such materials. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;macroisostere&#8221; design strategy, where the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in polyurethanes (PUs) is replaced with a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO2&#8211;), resulting in a virtually unknown family of polymers called polysulfamates. This approach, inspired by the use of bioisosteres in drug discovery, aims to preserve key interchain interactions that contribute to thermomechanical performance while enhancing the hydrolytic lability of the polymer backbone. The optimization of a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) polymerization allowed the synthesis of ten polysulfamates structurally analogous to common PUs. Comparative analysis of one PU and its polysulfamate analog showed that this isosteric substitution increases thermal stability, slightly lowers the glass transition temperature, and retains similar hardness and reduced Young's modulus. Notably, the S(VI)&#8208;based polysulfamate demonstrated significantly enhanced hydrolytic degradability.

     alt="Polysulfamates as &#8220;Macroisosteres&#8221; of Polyurethanes with Improved Degradability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports the synthesis of polysulfamates&#8212;sulfur(VI) isomeric analogs of polyurethanes in which the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in the repeating unit is replaced by a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;). Analysis of these polyurethane &#8220;macroisosteres&#8221; revealed enhanced hydrolytic degradability, improved thermal stability, and retained mechanical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the environmental persistence of plastics requires the development of next-generation polymers that combine high performance with enhanced degradability. Progress toward this grand challenge has been impeded, in part, by the absence of a general blueprint for the macromolecular design of such materials. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;macroisostere&#8221; design strategy, where the carbonyl group (&#8211;CO&#8211;) in polyurethanes (PUs) is replaced with a sulfonyl group (&#8211;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;), resulting in a virtually unknown family of polymers called polysulfamates. This approach, inspired by the use of bioisosteres in drug discovery, aims to preserve key interchain interactions that contribute to thermomechanical performance while enhancing the hydrolytic lability of the polymer backbone. The optimization of a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) polymerization allowed the synthesis of ten polysulfamates structurally analogous to common PUs. Comparative analysis of one PU and its polysulfamate analog showed that this isosteric substitution increases thermal stability, slightly lowers the glass transition temperature, and retains similar hardness and reduced Young's modulus. Notably, the S(VI)-based polysulfamate demonstrated significantly enhanced hydrolytic degradability. These results highlight the potential of the &#8220;macroisostere&#8221; approach as a generalizable strategy for designing high-performance, degradable alternatives to traditional plastics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anisotropic Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Chiral Hybrid Palladium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid palladium (Pd) halides [(R/S&#8208;MBA)2PdCl4] single crystals are synthesized, and their nonlinear optical (NLO) activities are investigated. The chiral crystals exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and effective SHG circular dichroism (CD). Moreover, this work demonstrates circularly polarized SHG in lead&#8208;free hybrid metal halides (HMHs) with an anisotropic factor up to 0.88. 








Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs) have attracted considerable attention due to their promising application in various optoelectronic devices. In this work, one kind of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) R/S&#8208;methylbenzylammonium)2PdCl4 [(R/S&#8208;MBA)2PdCl4] single crystals have been synthesized, which possess an indirect bandgap and exhibit energy band splitting at the valence band maximum (VBM) due to the distortion in the [PdCl4]2&#8722; square&#8208;planar structure. Notably, the chiral single crystals demonstrate a significant second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficient i.e., 15 times that of Y&#8208;cut quartz and second&#8208;harmonic generation&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) with an anisotropy factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.54. Interestingly, circularly polarized&#8208;SHG (CP&#8208;SHG) with an anisotropy factor (gCP&#8208;SHG) up to 0.88 is observed in the lead&#8208;free HMHs. These findings highlight the potential of chiral hybrid palladium (Pd) halides for applications in nonlinear optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Simultaneous Charge Extraction Enhancement and Defect Passivation Via a Planar Conjugated Molecular Interface Enable 22.49%&#8208;Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a planar conjugated molecule, 1,8&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine (2&#8208;NA), is introduced as a multifunctional interfacial modifier in CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite solar cells. It enhances hole extraction and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ defects, boosting carrier dynamics and reducing recombination. Furthermore, a hydrophobic interfacial layer also improves moisture resistance, ultimately enabling a record 22.49% efficiency.








Abstract
Rational molecular design at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface presents a viable strategy to suppress nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, simultaneously achieving efficient defect passivation and rapid charge extraction with a single molecular modifier remains challenging. Herein, we employ a planar conjugated molecule, 1,8&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine (2&#8208;NA), as a multifunctional interfacial modifier that concurrently enhances charge extraction and suppresses interfacial recombination in CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx PSCs. Combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analyses reveal that 2&#8208;NA forms a dense protective layer via noncovalent interactions (e.g., &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding), effectively passivating undercoordinated Pb2+ while inhibiting ion migration. Remarkably, 2&#8208;NA incorporation facilitates hot&#8208;carrier extraction, reducing the carrier cooling time from 515 to 240 fs and quadrupling the carrier diffusion length, thereby improving charge transport. As a result, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.49%, the highest reported value for this class of PSCs to date. Furthermore, the device retains 93.6% of its initial PCE after 1008 h under ambient conditions, demonstrating exceptional stability. This work offers a promising molecular engineering approach for enhancing the performance and durability of inorganic PSCs through interfacial modification.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Targeting Integrated Sandwich&#8208;Structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12 Composite Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;like NZSP composite electrolyte was constructed by designing an artificial interface layer of SbF3 and PVDF on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Due to the unique interface design, this PVDF&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3 electrolyte could effectively address the interface contacts on both cathode/anode, thus facilitating the Na+ diffusion kinetics, thereby achieving excellent rate capability and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability for SMBs.








Abstract
Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) has stimulated considerable attention due to its remarkable ionic conductivity and exceptional chemical/electrochemical stability. However, an unstable electrolyte/electrode interface and large interface resistance severely restricted its practical application. To settle this issue, an interface&#8208;targeting integrated sandwich&#8208;like NZSP composite electrolyte was constructed by designing an artificial interface layer on both the anode and cathode sides. The uniformly deposited SbF3 layer on the anode side of NZSP instantly formed a NaxSb/NaF&#8208;rich conductive layer during discharging, which effectively suppressed the growth of Na dendrites. The flexible PVDF layer on the cathode side of NZSP mitigated volume expansion/contraction and thus enhanced the poor solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact. Befitting the unique interface design, the Na/SbF3&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3/Na symmetric cells demonstrated a critical current density of up to 1.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and achieved ultra&#8208;stable plating/stripping cycling over 2600&#160;h at 0.1 and 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Noticeably, the Na3V2(PO4)3/PVDF&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3/Na full cells attained a high capacity retention of 90.0% after 2100 cycles at 0.5 C. Even for a high mass loading of 10.33&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, Na3V2(PO4)3/PVDF&#8208;NZSP&#8208;SbF3/Na has no capacity attenuation over 50 cycles at 0.1 C. This bilateral interface design strategy promotes the utilization of NZSP electrolytes and offers an avenue for the development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs).

Angle&#8208;dependent Bader charge and density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that, in contrast to low&#8208;angle GBs, high&#8208;angle GBs enhance Sn&#8208;site electrophilicity and stabilize *OCHO, guiding a precision engineering strategy for next&#8208;generation CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate catalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate offers a sustainable pathway for carbon&#8208;neutral fuel production, yet achieving high selectivity and activity remains challenging due to competing hydrogen evolution. While grain boundaries (GBs) enhance catalytic performance, the impact of GB density, uniformity, and twisting angles remains unclear. Here, we engineer SnS nanoplates with high&#8208;density GBs via cation exchange (CE), preserving sulfur frameworks while inducing strain&#8208;driven domain segmentation. The GB&#8208;SnS catalyst achieves a formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.9% at &#8722;1.0 VRHE, with a partial current density of 204.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.2 VRHE, surpassing single&#8208;crystalline (SC) SnS by 3.5&#8208;fold. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) reveal high&#8208;angle GBs lower *OCHO stabilization barriers while suppressing *H adsorption. Counterintuitively, small&#8208;angle GBs raise the *OCHO barrier, impairing CO2RR&#8212;a finding that challenges the assumption that all GBs benefit catalysis. DFT further predicts out&#8208;of&#8208;plane rotational GBs similarly enhance stabilization, guiding future 3D defect engineering. The catalyst demonstrates industrial viability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), sustaining &gt;80% FE at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 150&#160;h. Statistical analysis of &gt;200 GBs correlates twisting angles with adsorption strength, establishing an angle&#8208;dependent design principle. This work decouples geometric/electronic GB effects and pioneers solution&#8208;phase CE for scalable defect&#8208;rich catalysts, advancing sustainable CO2 utilization.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Covalent Organic Frameworks via Isoreticular Design, Isomerism, and Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isoreticular COFs were synthesized by incrementally extending the organic linker from benzene to biphenyl to triphenyl, alongside their reversed&#8208;imine&#8208;orientation isomers, enabling a clear comparison of structural effects on activity. Notably, by optimizing protonation conditions, the biphenyl&#8208;linked COF&#8208;920 achieved an unprecedented hydrogen evolution rate of 364 mmol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185; under UV&#8211;visible irradiation, as rigorously confirmed by water&#8208;drainage and gas&#8208;gathering experiments.








Abstract
Rational structural engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has significantly advanced their application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) from water splitting. However, the practical application of COFs for scalable solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion remains limited due to their insufficient photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we achieved an exceptionally high hydrogen evolution rate of 364&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 using HCl&#8208;protonated COF&#8208;920 under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light, as confirmed by water&#8208;drainage and gas&#8208;gathering experiments, exceeding most previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Three series of isoreticular COFs were synthesized, incorporating benzene, biphenyl, and triphenyl linkers, along with their structural isomers featuring reversed imine bond orientations, to systematically investigate the collaborative influences of linker length, structural isomerism, and protonation on the photocatalytic performance. Experimental results revealed that COFs employing biphenyl&#8208;based linkers exhibited superior photocatalytic activity compared to those with benzene or triphenyl linkers. Moreover, the performance difference resulting from variations in imine orientation decreases with increasing linker length, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing narrower energy differences between units connected by imine bonds (&#9472;C&#9552;N&#9472;). Our findings not only provide new insights into structure&#8211;activity relationships in COF photocatalysts but also highlight the potential of COF materials for sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Transforming CO Poisoning into a Critical Step for Electrocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling to Urea in a Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8208;Dominated Nanoreactor</title>

The Cu&#8208;CDs/Cu5FeS4 multisite nanoreactor for stepwise multi&#8208;species coupling to synthesize urea within the CDs&#8208;dominated nano&#8208;space via utilizing the CO poisoning effect.








Abstract
Modern catalysis science has traditionally viewed carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning negatively due to its detrimental effects, such as the deactivation of metal sites. Here, we demonstrate a transformative approach by converting CO poisoning into a beneficial strategy to achieve high activity and selectivity in urea electrosynthesis. We designed a multiscale and multisite nanoreactor composed of copper&#8211;carbon dots (Cu&#8208;CDs) and bornite&#160;(Cu5FeS4),&#160;which exploits CO&#8208;poisoned iron sites as anchors to facilitate efficient multi&#8208;species integration. This nanoreactor configuration delivers an unprecedented Curea &#8208; selectivity of 100%, a high urea yield rate of 1131.84&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 42.35% at an ultra&#8208;low potential. Consequently, the catalyst achieves exceptional dual benefits of a high yield rate and low energy consumption of 31.18&#160;kWh kgurea&#8722;1, outperforming all previously reported earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts. Mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between Fe and *CO, coupled with spatially separated yet adjacent Fe, Cu1, and Cu2 sites, enables stepwise conversion from *CO to *CONH2 and subsequently to *CO(NH2)2 within the nano&#8208;confined space dominated by Cu&#8208;CDs. This work provides a groundbreaking catalyst design strategy by effectively harnessing CO poisoning for enhanced electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Size&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Sugars and Polyols Using Zeolites for Renewable Surfactant Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite&#8208;catalyzed strategy enables size&#8208;selective monoacetalization of sugars and polyols in a single step by leveraging pore confinement to distinguish between mono&#8208; and multi&#8208;substituted species. This broadly applicable method avoids protection steps and excess reagents, opening new routes to bio&#8208;based amphiphiles with strong surface activity and hard&#8208;water resistance.








Abstract
Diol functionalization with acetals in carbohydrates and polyols is ubiquitously used in protection chemistry and in the manufacture of several platform chemicals. However, the selective functionalization of molecules where multiple acetalization reactions can occur typically involves multiple protection/deprotection steps. Here, we show that zeolites can be used to size&#8208;selectively acetalize sugars and polyols in a single step, and we demonstrate the potential of this approach for producing functional chemicals and materials. We show that high selectivity is dependent on effective pore confinement, which is achieved by a careful pairing of the substrate size and the zeolite morphology. This zeolite&#8208;catalyzed strategy exhibited consistently good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (70%&#8211;95%) of novel polyol/sugar monoacetals, notably offering an easy route to bio&#8208;based amphiphiles. These resulting xylose&#8208;based surfactants exhibited similar or superior surface activity and, remarkably, hard&#8208;water resistance compared to their nonrenewable ethoxylated analogues, which illustrates the potential for practical applications of this approach.

Modulating base&#8208;stacking interactions through locked nucleic acid (LNA) modifications significantly enhances the hybridization kinetics of DNA duplexes, enabling precise control over DNA crystal growth.








Abstract
DNA hybridization and assembly processes are governed by the concerted effects of Watson&#8211;Crick pairing and base&#8208;stacking interactions. While sequence engineering and chemical modifications have been extensively exploited to regulate DNA hybridization processes and complex structural assembly of DNA, here we demonstrate the use of locked nucleic acid (LNA) modifications to finely tune base&#8208;stacking interactions, which are yet to be explored in DNA assembly processes, to program the growth of self&#8208;assembled DNA crystals. We find that sticky&#8208;end LNA modifications decrease base&#8208;pair spacing and enhance base&#8208;stacking energy, which synergistically improves interstrand affinity and accelerates hybridization rate constants, as revealed by strand displacement kinetics, molecular dynamics simulations, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis. This LNA&#8208;based base&#8208;stacking engineering strategy can finely tune base&#8208;stacking energy landscapes to drive anisotropic growth and morphological control in self&#8208;assembled DNA crystal. We further establish a quantitative framework for probing structure&#8211;energy relationships in base&#8208;stacking interactions, which not only paves the way for better control of structural DNA nanotechnology but also provides mechanistic insights for developing dynamic DNA nanosystems.

         <title>Synthesis, Conformal Analysis, and Antibody Binding of Staphylococcus aureus Capsular Polysaccharide Type 5 Oligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of conjugation&#8208;ready Staphylococcus aureus serotype 5 oligosaccharides has been generated using a stereoselective [3&#160;+&#160;3n] glycosylation strategy. The structures differ in chain length (up to three repeating units) and O&#8208; and N&#8208;acetylation pattern. The oligomers adopt a unique extended shape with hydrophobic patches formed by the O/N&#8208;acetyl groups. The acetylated hexasaccharide is revealed as a promising epitope for vaccine development.








Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most prominent pathogens responsible for life&#8208;threatening hospital acquired infections. Most clinical isolates belong to serotype 5 or 8, which express unique capsular polysaccharides (CP), composed of the rare N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;mannosaminuronic acid (&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ManNAcA), N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;l&#8208;fucosamine (&#945;&#8208;l&#8208;FucNAc) and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;fucosamine (&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;FucNAc) that can be used for the development of conjugate vaccines. Different acetylation patterns of CP5 create microheterogeneous polymers, carrying partial zwitterionic character, which may be important for immunological activity. We here report on the assembly of a set of conjugation&#8208;ready CP5 oligosaccharides, ranging in length from trisaccharides to nonasaccharides. The developed protecting group strategy has allowed the incorporation of N&#8208;acetyl, &#8208;NH3+ and O&#8208;acetyl groups. The reported syntheses offer solutions for the construction of the challenging cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages, the incorporation of many different functional groups and the installation of an appropriate linker for future conjugation purposes. Conformational analysis of the O&#8208;acetylated oligomers has revealed a distinctive linear conformation with the repeating units (RUs) being flipped &#8764;180&#176; with respect to the flanking RUs. Binding studies with CP5&#8208;antibodies revealed the trisaccharide to be too short for relevant binding, while the hexa&#8208; and nonasaccharides exhibited strong binding. The l&#8208;FucNAc acetyl esters and d&#8208;FucNAc acetamides were shown to be crucial for binding.

         <title>Toward Stable Zinc Anode: An AI&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Electrolyte Additives for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence&#8208;driven approach using graph neural network was employed to analyze 75&#160;024 organic molecules, among which 48 promising candidate molecules were identified by this high&#8208;throughput screening method, and cyanoacetamide and hydantoin were experimentally validated as novel electrolyte additives to improve stability and reversibility of the zinc anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Currently, challenges such as zinc dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, and byproduct formation on the zinc anode damage the performance and cycling stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Electrolyte additives, especially organic molecule additives, provide an effective and cost&#8208;efficient strategy to address these issues. To efficiently screen a large number of organic molecules for developing new electrolyte additives, we employ an artificial intelligence&#8208;driven approach, using graph neural network to analyze 75&#160;024 organic molecules based on three key properties, including adsorption energies on Zn(002) surface, redox potentials, and water solubility. We identified 48 promising candidate molecules by this high&#8208;throughput screening method, among which cyanoacetamide (CA) and hydantoin (HN) were experimentally validated as novel electrolyte additives for AZIBs that have not been reported previously. The experimental and calculation results demonstrate that CA and HN preferentially adsorb onto the surface of the zinc anode, resulting in the enhanced interfacial stability of zinc anodes. This behavior effectively mitigates zinc dendrite formation, contributing to the improved stability and reversibility of the zinc electrode. It is believed that our work combines AI&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput research, experimental validation, and theoretical calculations, providing a scalable framework for selecting and developing new electrolyte additive molecules.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Amino Acids from Plastic, Air, and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>

This study presents a hybrid system for sustainable alanine production by integrating thermocatalytic depolymerization of polylactic acid plastics, plasma&#8208;assisted nitrogen fixation from air, and electrochemical synthesis, enabling waste upcycling into valuable chemicals using renewable energy.








Abstract
Amino acids as fundamental building blocks exhibit versatile applications spanning from food science to pharmaceutical development. Conventional biological and chemical synthetic approaches suffer from low efficiency and elevated energy demands. While emerging thermocatalysis and photocatalysis strategies offer promising alternatives, their environmental sustainability is substantially constrained by their reliance on Haber&#8211;Bosch&#8208;derived ammonia as a nitrogen source, which contributes to a significant carbon footprint. Here we developed a hybrid thermochemical&#8208;plasma&#8208;electrochemical system for sustainable alanine synthesis directly from end&#8208;of&#8208;life polylactic acid (PLA) plastic using atmospheric nitrogen as a nitrogen source. The synthetic pathway for alanine production initiates with the thermocatalytic oxidative depolymerization of PLA to pyruvic acid (PA) in aqueous medium under mild conditions (140&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;MPa air), utilizing a Pt/SiO2 catalyst with high impurity tolerance. Concurrently, a nitrate&#8208;enriched solution is generated through plasma&#8208;mediated activation of air and water under ambient conditions. Subsequently, the PA and nitrate solutions are mixed and directly introduced to the electrochemical reactor. We employ a strain&#8208;engineered CuBi alloy electrocatalyst capable of stably catalyzing alanine production via co&#8208;electrolysis of PA and nitrate. This integrated process establishes a sustainable pathway to valorize low&#8208;cost feedstocks into high&#8208;value commodity chemicals using renewable energy while mitigating plastic pollution.

The synergetic combination of crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly approaches leads to the formation of elongated core&#8208;crystalline micelles decorated with multiple amorphous beads. The preparation of such well&#8208;defined and uniform multi&#8208;dimensional meso&#8208;structures paves the way toward the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of polymeric supercarriers.









Abstract
All the objects that surround us can be seen as combinations of elementary shapes like spheres, rods, and squares that perform complex tasks when connected in a well&#8208;defined manner. While making a device by assembling those shapes remains relatively easy at the human scale, it is extremely challenging to do so at the nanoscale, due to the difficulty to covalently attach at a defined position a nano&#8208;object with a given shape to another one of different geometry. To circumvent this hurdle, here, we introduce an innovative approach that consists in performing polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) onto core&#8208;crystalline micelles prepared by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA). Because of the intrinsic properties of CDSA, one can construct one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional substrates to initiate PISA at very specific locations. Performing CDSA&#8208;substrated&#8208;PISA (CDSA&#8208;s&#8208;PISA) onto triblock co&#8208;micelles where only the central block was PISA active, led to the formation of elongated structures bearing one or two beads on their central parts, while CDSA&#8208;s&#8208;PISA on entirely PISA active micelles and in presence of free macro&#8208;CTA, allowed the preparation of uniform elongated micelles fully decorated with beads. These results offer a sneak peek of what the next generation of multitasks polymeric assemblies will be.

         <title>Impacts of the Conductive Networks on Solid&#8208;State Battery Operation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state composite cathode's hierarchical architecture, characterized by uneven distributions of Li+ and e&#8722; conductive networks, critically impacts ASSB operation. Here, using model systems with varying Li+/e&#8722; conductive networks and multimodal spectro&#8208;microscopy, we reveal that unbalanced and unpaired distribution of Li+/e&#8722; channels across NMC particle surface governs cathode degradation by inducing microscopic electrochemical polarization.








Abstract
The micromorphology of composite cathodes is known to play a vital role in determining all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) performance. However, much of our current understanding is derived from empirical observations, lacking a deeper mechanistic foundation. The &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; concept of battery chemistry requires maintaining charge neutrality, emphasizing the necessity of examining electrode micromorphology from the perspective of conductive networks. This study systematically investigates the microscopic electrochemical impacts of conductive network micromorphology by varying the Li+&#8208;to&#8208;e&#8722; channel ratio in cathodes comprising LiNbO3&#8208;coated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, Li6PS5Cl, and carbon fibers. Utilizing multiscale synchrotron&#8208;based spectro&#8208;microscopy, we unravel that unbalanced Li+ and e&#8722; conducting channels intensify charge polarization within active cathode particles and accelerate their degradation. A further model system with X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;tomography resolved e&#8722; and Li+ channels indicates that spatially uniform and well&#8208;paired Li+ and e&#8722; conducting channels are highly desirable as they could promote more uniform lithiation/delithiation, mitigating microscopic electrochemical polarization. Electrode&#8208;scale X&#8208;ray holotomography analysis reveals that the impact of conductive networks is particle&#8208;size&#8208;dependent, with smaller cathode particles being more significantly affected. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between conductive networks and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery operation, laying the groundwork for rational design and optimization of cathode architectures in future solid&#8208;state battery technologies.

         <title>Unveiling an Alternative Mechanism for Lewis Basic Selenium as a C&#9472;H Hydrogen Bond Catalyst and Its Application in the Halogenation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an unconventional mechanism in Lewis basic selenium&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic halogenation, where in situ oxidation of selenourea by the halogen source generates hypervalent Se&#8208;imidazolium species. These intermediates function as hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysts to activate N&#8208;haloamide reagents, enabling efficient and mild halogenation of arenes, particularly valuable for late&#8208;stage bromination of pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Electrophilic halogenation is a fundamentally useful transformation, and Lewis basic selenium catalysts together with N&#8208;haloimides are known to promote the reaction under mild conditions. Selenourea is a frequently used platform for the Lewis base catalyst design. In literature, it is generally believed that the Lewis basic selenium can form a Lewis adduct with the halogen as the active halogenating species. Herein, we report our recent finding that unveils an alternative mechanism of this type of reaction. It was found that the Lewis basic selenourea is first oxidized by the halogen source to give a benchtop stable and non&#8208;hygroscopic imidazolium hypervalent selenium dibromide compound that acts as the actual catalyst. The negative charge in the hypervalent selenium compound is stabilized by the electronegative bromide, leading to the site&#8208;isolated and unoccupied imidazolium cationic moiety. Mechanistic studies suggest that the electropositive C&#8211;Hs of the imidazolium cation can act as a strong hydrogen bond donor to activate the N&#8208;haloimide reagent for efficient halogenation reaction, including late&#8208;stage halogenation of drug molecules, with low catalyst loading. Further study revealed that hypervalent imidazolium selenium dibromide can generally be applied to other mechanistically unrelated hydrogen bond&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Bond&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte Solutions for High&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A Li&#8208;bond&#8208;based electrolyte is developed which exhibits a wide operating temperature range (50&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C) and high lithium&#8208;ion conductivity of 6.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#160;&#176;C, promotes the formation of a dense LiF&#8208; and Li3N&#8208;rich SEI layer, and enables an lithium metal battery to deliver a high capacity retention of 80% over 635 cycles at 0.5 C at 100&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Achieving long&#8208;term cycling stability in high&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries (LMBs) demands both efficient ion transport and stable electrode interfaces. However, the molecular polarity and strong ionic interactions of conventional electrolytes hinder ion mobility and compromise interfacial stability. In this study, we developed a deep eutectic electrolyte based on Li&#8208;bond (Li&#8208;DEE) comprising tetraethylammonium nitrate and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, which is different from the traditional hydrogen bonding or lithium ionic bonding electrolyte. The Li&#8208;bond network within the Li&#8208;DEE enables rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport (6.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#160;&#176;C) while forming a stable electrode interface rich in Li3N and LiF. As a result, the Li&#8208;DEE enables an LMB to deliver a high capacity retention of 80% over 635 cycles at 0.5 C and a capacity of 84.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles at 2 C and 100&#160;&#176;C. This study provides valuable insights for designing next&#8208;generation electrolytes that function under extreme operating conditions.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of &#916;AA&#8208;Peptides Using a Bioorthogonal pro&#8208;Amino Acid and Aqueous Flavin Photocatalyst: Green Light Enhances Catalyst Performance and Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We devise a new bioorthogonal amino acid, &#916;Sulf, that can be encoded into peptides and then reacted with carbon radicals, spawned from an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, boronic acids, and green LEDs to produce libraries of &#916;AA peptides. We use this platform to discover inhibitors of A&#946;42 aggregation for treating Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs) are vital building blocks in the design and optimization of peptide drugs. The exact olefin geometry, side chain chemotype, and ancillary &#946;&#8208;carbon substituents play a significant role. Unfortunately, general approaches to install these motifs into peptides are lacking, complicated by the instability of unsaturated residues during traditional amide&#8208;bond coupling and failure of divergent protocols, such as oxidative Heck and Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons, to accommodate a complete range of substrate classes. Herein, we conceive and interrogate an original bioorthogonal reagent, &#946;&#8208;sulfonyldehydroamino acid (&#916;Sulf), that can be site&#8208;specifically encoded into standard peptides through solid&#8208; or liquid&#8208;phase synthesis. When combined with an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, myriad boronic acids and 525&#160;nm light&#8212;a more biologically benign portion of the flavin visible absorption spectra that has not previously been exploited for flavin photoredox catalysis,&#8212;this latent residue becomes one of several (Z)&#8208;&#916;AA variants (aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic)&#160;via&#160;stereoretentive radical conjugate addition and &#946;&#8208;scission. The importance of green light is established through mechanistic studies showing that it tempers radical formation and discourages flavin&#8208;catalyzed isomerization, controlling product selectivity. We apply our original reagent and catalytic platform in a brief medicinal chemistry campaign to discover tetrapeptides that modulate A&#946;42 aggregation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Judicious Use of Chalcogens in Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters Leads to OLEDs with Efficiencies Exceeding 36% and Showing Mild Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
At doping ratios ranging from 1 to 12&#160;wt%, the BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se&#8208;based sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs exhibited nearly unchanged EL spectra with small FWHMs of 27&#8211;30&#160;nm and EQEmax of 36.4&#8211;43.1%. The BN&#8208;Se&#8208;based OLED exhibited low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQEs remaining at 36.7 and 31.8% at 100 and 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best EL performance among mono&#8208;boron MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs to date. 








Abstract
Strategies that produce OLEDs that simultaneously achieve outstanding electroluminescence efficiency, small efficiency roll&#8208;off, good stability, and high color purity remain in strong demand. Herein, we report how judicious decoration of a benzochalcogenophene onto the BCzBN core leads to an acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC) without sacrificing either color fidelity and photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL). Compared with BCzBN, the kRISC of BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se are accelerated to 2.5&#160;&#215;&#160;105 and 7.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 from 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;s&#8722;1, each with near&#8208;unity &#934;PLs. BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se show narrowband emission at 483&#160;nm (FWHM of 22&#160;nm) and 485&#160;nm (FWHM of 22&#160;nm). The corresponding non&#8208;sensitized OLEDs using BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se exhibited record&#8208;breaking maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 43.1 and 36.9%, without any external light extraction techniques. Furthermore, the BN&#8208;Se&#8208;based OLED showed ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQEs remaining at 36.7 and 31.8% at 100 and 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. These emitters do not easily suffer from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Even at 12&#160;wt% doping, the EQEmax of the OLEDs with BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se were 36.7 and 36.4%, respectively, with mild efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQEs at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 of 19.1 and 30.8%, respectively), and nearly unchanged electroluminescence spectra.

         <title>Programmable DNA Nanocages Enable Adaptive Spatiotemporal Organization of Biomimetic Organelle Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanocages on extracellular vesicles form synthetic cytoskeletal scaffolds that stabilize compartmentalized units while enabling programmable reconfiguration of contact sites. This adaptive system achieves stimulus&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal control of inter&#8208;biomimetic&#8208;organelle communication.








Abstract
Synthetic organelles have emerged to simulate the multicompartmental organization and communication within cells. However, current synthetic organelles (e.g., lipid vesicles and polymer&#8208;based assemblies) often suffer from insufficient structural stability and lack adaptive feedback mechanisms due to the absence of support and dynamic regulation by natural cytoskeletal proteins, which limits the construction of autonomous communication networks. Here, we present a modular and programmable DNA nanocage strategy for constructing stable and adaptive synthetic organelle networks. Using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a model, we anchored tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDNs) on the EV surface and assembled a mechanically reinforced biomimetic DNA nanocage via palindromic hybridization chain reaction (PHCR), thereby significantly enhancing vesicle stability and effectively preventing membrane fusion upon contact. The modular design enables the integration of logic&#8208;gated DNA elements as dynamic contact sites, allowing environment&#8208;responsive reconfiguration of inter&#8208;artificial&#8208;organelle spatial organization and signaling. This work provides a customizable platform for constructing artificial organelles with adaptive feedback regulation, offering broad potential in synthetic biology, biomedical applications, and smart material design.

         <title>Reactions of Difluorocarbene with Organogold(I) Complexes: Synthesis of Gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Organometallics via Difluorocarbene Insertion and Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report stable and isolable difluoromethylene transition metal complexes, synthesized by reaction of free difluorocarbene with organogold(I) precursors. Difluorocarbene insertion reactions occurs with alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;gold(I) complexes, whereas the difluorocarbene cycloaddition reaction occurs with alkynylgold(I) complex.








Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluoromethylene functional group is an important motif in medicinal chemistry, and development of new fluoroalkyl&#8208;metal systems has been crucial to enable new syntheses of gem&#8208;difluoromethylenes. However, well&#8208;defined and isolable examples of either nucleophilic RCF2M or difluorocyclopropenyl transition metal complexes are rare. The Au(I) platform has been useful for the synthesis of isolable transition&#8208;metal complexes bearing reactive ligands. Herein we utilize reactions of difluorocarbene with organogold(I) complexes, analogous to reactions of difluorocarbene with organic substrates, to access novel examples of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene organometallics. First, difluorocarbene insertion into the R&#9472;Au(I) bond of organogold(I) species with free difluorocarbene was demonstrated for the first time, forming alkyl&#8208;CF2&#8208;Au(I) and aryl&#8208;CF2&#8208;Au(I) species. Second, via a difluorocarbene cycloaddition reaction we isolate for the first time a &#954;1&#8208;difluorocyclopropenyl&#8208;transition metal complex, formed by reaction of alkynylAu(I) complex with free difluorocarbene. Subsequent study of these reaction systems by density functional theory calculations facilitated study of the difluorocarbene insertion reactions, and a comparison of difluorocarbene insertion and cycloaddition pathways in the reaction of difluorocarbene and alkynylAu(I).

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Samarium diiodide (Sml2) is an effective catalyst for the mild, atom&#8208;economical coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones, and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes to give functionalized norbornane structural motifs not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches. In addition to aryl&#8208;substituted housane ketones, harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce alkyl housane ketones are also excellent substrates for the radical cross&#8208;coupling.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (Sml2)&#8208;catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Frictionless Ion Transport Battery Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of covalent organic framework quantum dots has been developed to optimize the electrolyte to achieve near&#8208;frictionless ion transport and high electrochemical performance in Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
Optimization of electrolyte with enhanced energy density and durability in battery system is highly demanded yet challenging owing to the high ion transport resistance and complex by&#8208;reactions in electrolyte. In this work, we tailored the solid&#8211;liquid phase transport interface by adding covalent organic frameworks quantum dots (COFs QDs) into electrolyte. COFs QDs with abundant lipophilic ether&#8208;oxygen groups and &#8764;12&#160;nm nano&#8208;size can serve as myriad ion&#8208;transport nano&#8208;engines for constantly replenishing the interface with Li+ to achieve near&#8208;frictionless ion transport (tLi+&#160;=&#160;0.98) and exceptional stability (&gt;400 days). Lithium&#8211;sulfur battery based on COFs QDs shows high discharge specific capacity of 1063.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#160;C and maintains a low overpotential (&#8764;16&#160;mV) over 4000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 in Li//Li symmetric battery. A Li&#8211;S pouch battery has also been successfully assembled to validate the practicality. Our results may promote the development of COFs QDs in energy storage field.

         <title>Metabolic Engineering of the 5&#8208;Aminolevulinate Biosynthetic Pathway in E. coli Improves Efficiency of Hemoprotein&#8208;Based Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have engineered the heme biosynthetic pathway in E. coli to develop an efficient cofactor supplementation system for hemoproteins. Through the incorporation of the heterogeneous C4 pathway, the engineered cells significantly increase the expression levels of active holohemoproteins and enhance the efficiency of whole&#8208;cell and lysate&#8208;based biocatalysis promoted by a variety of hemoproteins. 








Abstract
Biocatalysis using heme&#8208;dependent enzymes provides a powerful synthetic platform to facilitate a variety of chemical transformations required for organic synthesis. Despite recent advances in biocatalysis, recombinant expression systems for hemoproteins leave much room for improvement due to the strict regulation of heme biosynthesis in the host organism. To develop an efficient cofactor supplementation system for the expression of active holohemoproteins, we describe metabolic engineering of the heme biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. Through incorporation of a heterogeneous C4 pathway involving 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid synthase of Paracoccus denitrificans, it was found that the concentrations of 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid and heme in the engineered cells are increased during cultivation, and the expression level of the holohemoproteins is significantly improved. Notably, the heme content in the engineered cells is even higher than that produced by conventional cultivation methods, which add 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid into the culture medium. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the application of this engineered E. coli cells in whole&#8208;cell and lysate&#8208;based biocatalysis using various types of heme&#8208;dependent enzymes. Considering the recent demand for biocatalysis, the system developed in this study will serve as a new practical and versatile platform for hemoprotein&#8208;based biocatalysis.

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical inertness of Li2S2 leads to irreversible sulfur loss. MoNQDs/NC reconfigure the solvation shell structure, thereby weakening the ion&#8208;dipole effect within Li(solvent)x+ and enabling a fast desolvation process. Furthermore, localized dipole fields from their ordered Mo&#8211;N atoms enhance dipole&#8211;dipole interactions with Li2S2. This induces tensile strain, destabilizing Li2S2 and promoting its decomposition. Via this dual mechanism, MoNQDs/NC enable high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading LSBs to achieve low capacity decay over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
The incomplete conversion of sulfur species, particularly the pivotal intermediate solid Li2S2 during redox processes, poses a significant limitation on the cyclability of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a synergistic modulation strategy of ion&#8208;/dipole&#8211;dipole interactions that tailors the solvation sheath configuration and activates the electrochemical reactivity of Li2S2 is initially proposed for accelerating kinetics. As a proof of concept, the molybdenum nitride quantum dots located on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoNQDs/NC) were designed. Advanced in situ/ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations reveal that MoNQDs/NC effectively weaken the ion&#8208;dipole interactions within Li(solvent)x+ species, thereby facilitating the desolvation process. Furthermore, the robust dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between polar domains of MoNQDs and Li2S2 are realized to generate localized tensile strain fields to destabilize the S&#9472;S/Li&#9472;S bonds network. Consequently, the optimal cells maintain a high areal capacity (&gt;5.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) after 50 cycles at high sulfur loading (4.4&#8211;9.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) over a wide temperature range (0&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the pouch cell with a sulfur loading of 1.5&#160;g retained a capacity of 1.79 Ah after 15 cycles, highlighting the potential of this ion&#8208;dipole modulation strategy for commercializing LSBs.

Pillaring Mg2&#8314; into Co&#8208;free single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.75Mn0.25O2 suppresses multi&#8208;directional planar slipping and microcracking along the (003)/(100) planes, enhancing mechanical stability. DFT and COMSOL simulations unveil the interplay between internal stress and cleavage energy, guiding chemo&#8211;electro&#8211;mechanical optimization for durable Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. The schematic was created using Autodesk 3ds Max (Autodesk Inc.).








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for lithium&#8208;based batteries, but they suffer from chemo&#8211;electro&#8211;mechanical instabilities. While single&#8208;crystal morphologies reduce these issues, slipping, and microcracking persist during extended cycling, and the degradation mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Herein, we report on multi&#8208;directional planar slipping and microcracking along the (003) and (100) planes in a single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.75Mn0.25O2 (LNM) cathode. According to the Darken&#8211;Gurry theory and formation energy in LNM, magnesium (Mg2+) has been selected as the best pillaring element to strengthen the structural integrity and improve cycling stability. Notably, Li0.99Mg0.01Ni0.75Mn0.25O2 (LMNM) achieves a capacity retention of 91% after 1000 cycles at 4.3&#160;V operation against graphite by alleviating instability issues. We systematically unravel the pillaring effect, for the first time, from the quantum scale to the lattice level and from the microscale to the macroscopic level of the cathode particles, providing an in&#8208;depth understanding of chemo&#8211;electro&#8211;mechanical degradation.

         <title>Au&#8208;Decorated Nb2O5 Featuring Unsaturated Niobium Centers and Photoinduced Oxygen Vacancies for Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane to C2+ Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold loaded Nb2O5 nanorods featuring unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OV) sites significantly boost the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane into C2+ hydrocarbons, in which unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced OV sites cooperatively mediated CH4 activation, C&#9472;C bond formation and lattice oxygen looping to deliver exceptional selectivity and stability.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) holds considerable potential for producing value&#8208;added chemicals. However, this technology currently faces two major challenges: low methane conversion and significant overoxidation. Herein, we report a gold (Au) decorated niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) featuring unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced oxygen vacancies (OV), which achieved a CH4 conversion rate of 3.21&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of &#8764;98.1% toward C2+ hydrocarbons (&#955;&#160;=&#160;320&#8722;780&#160;nm, 300&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), outperforming the selectivity of previously reported photocatalysts. Operando characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that the unsaturated Nb centers play a crucial role in promoting methane activation and facilitating the transfer of methyl (*CH3) intermediates to the Au cocatalyst, thereby boosting the C&#9472;C coupling pathway while suppressing undesired overoxidation. Concurrently, the photoinduced OV sites enable the timely release of H2O from the lattice oxygen, thus enhancing O2 activation and improving the lattice oxygen looping efficiency. This work provides new insights into the atomically precise design of photocatalysts that deliver both good activity and high selectivity in methane valorization.

         <title>Skeletal Remodeling of Pyridines Through Nitrogen Atom Transposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel skeletal remodeling strategy allows for the transformation of pyridine into aniline, which serves as a multifunctional synthetic intermediate. By utilizing Lewis acid catalysis, the process enhances nucleophilic addition and nitrogen atom transposition, facilitating the rapid synthesis of diverse bioactive compounds. Mechanistic investigations through DFT calculations provide insights into the underlying processes, highlighting the potential of this strategy in pharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
Heterocyclic replacements are crucial tools in medicinal chemistry, enhancing the physicochemical properties of lead compounds. Pyridine, a core structural motif in numerous drug candidates, often serves as a key heterocyclic scaffold. Nonetheless, a universally applicable synthetic strategy for the direct conversion of pyridines into a diverse array of other heterocycles has yet to be established. In this study, we present a skeletal remodeling strategy that enables the transformation of pyridines into corresponding anilines via Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen atom transposition. These anilines can subsequently serve as versatile intermediates for accessing a variety of heterocyclic structures, thereby facilitating the rapid synthesis of novel bioactive analogs. DFT calculations indicate that the Lewis acid catalyst not only aids in the formation of pyridinium salts, enhances nucleophilic addition and nitrogen release. This methodology demonstrates considerable utility across a range of complex pyridine derivatives and several commercially available drugs, highlighting its potential for pharmaceutical diversification.

         <title>Converting and Fabricating LiCoO2 Cathode Material into a Disordered Rocksalt Surface Modification Layer to Enhance Interfacial Stability of High&#8208;Voltage Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work converts layered LiCoO2 (LCO) into a disordered rocksalt coating material (DS) with anionic oxidation activity, inducing electrolyte nucleophilic decomposition to co&#8208;construct a stable LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). The synergy of enhanced CEI and DS coating, which has high Li+ conductivity and lattice coherence with LCO, notably improves interfacial stability and electrochemical performance of high&#8208;voltage LCO cathode.








Abstract
Surface coating acts as an effective strategy to enhance the interfacial stability of high&#8208;voltage cathode, but yet there remains substantial potential value in exploring optimal materials and methods. Herein, we convert spent LiCoO2 (LCO) into nanosized disordered rocksalt&#8208;phase (DS) coating material, which exhibits considerable Li+ conductivity and high lattice&#8208;coherent compatibility with LCO. Subsequently, using a facile and scalable high&#8208;speed mechanofusion technology, we construct a continuous, uniform, and tightly bound DS coating layer onto LCO, denoted as DS@LCO cathode. Benefiting from the nucleophilic reaction between fluorinated electrolyte and reactive oxygen released from DS coating layer, a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) film is achieved, with an outer LiF&#8208;rich protective shield and inner flexible fluorinated polymer. Coupled with the lattice&#8208;coherent DS coating layer and reinforced CEI film, the hybrid surface architecture synergistically enhances the interfacial stability, thermal safety, and electrochemical performance of DS@LCO cathode. As a result, a stable operation of DS@LCO half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.1% capacity retention after 250 cycles). Long&#8208;life and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density (1032&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) pouch cells are harvested, retaining over 86% capacity after 1000 cycles. This coating/CEI&#8208;coupled interface design provides a sustainable and scalable surface modification route for the development of high&#8208;voltage cathodes with enhanced interfacial stability.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired 2D Asymmetric Nanochannels for High&#8208;Resolution Li+/Mg2+ Separation</title>

An asymmetric structure of Janus graphene oxide membranes (JGOM) with diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior was constructed. Based on the synergy of the two nanochannels, the JGOM demonstrated robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance, outperforming symmetrical structure GO membranes and other reported 2D membranes.








Abstract
Extracting lithium from salt lake brines is crucial to achieve sustainable development of lithium resources. However, it remains a major challenge to design nanochannels with efficient selectivity and fast transport for target ions. Here, inspired by biological membranes, we reported a Janus graphene oxide membrane (JGOM) with an asymmetric structure that exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior and achieves high&#8208;efficiency Li+/Mg2&#8314; separation for lithium extraction applications. During the forward transport of ions, the nGO nanochannels modified by sulfonate groups (SO3&#8722;) with precise size provide hopping recognition sites and additional electrostatic attraction for the fast transport of Li+, while imposed Mg2+ dehydration and exposure to a stronger positive charge. The continuous pGO nanochannels modified by amino groups (NH3+) further prevent the passage of dehydrated Mg2+ by enhanced electrostatic repulsion while allowing Li+ to transfer. Under the synergy of the two nanochannels, the JGOM demonstrates robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance, outperforming symmetrical structure GO membranes and other reported membranes, which was further confirmed by simulation results. This study provides a new insight into the rational design of ion sieving membranes.

         <title>CO2 Photoreduction by H2O: Cooperative Catalysis of Palladium Species on Poly(triazine imide) Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particulate and isolated palladium species (Pd0 and Pd2+) supported on poly(triazine imide) prisms synergistically drive photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O. Pd0 and Pd2+ sites selectively capture photoexcited electrons and holes to drive CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation, respectively. Upon hole capture, Pd2+ is oxidized to Pd4+ that mediates H2O oxidation to O2, while bestowing H* to assist CO2 reduction on neighboring Pd0 particles.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with H2O oxidation has been pursued extensively, albeit facing challenges in efficiency and selectivity. Herein, we develop a PdSAs+NPs/PTI catalyst by co&#8208;anchoring atomic and nanoparticulate Pd species on poly(triazine imide) crystals, which exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability for CO2 reduction to CO using H2O as the reductant. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the dual Pd species synergistically enhance charge separation and transfer while promoting CO2 activation, CO desorption, and H2O dissociation. Photo&#8208;stimulated electrons migrate to Pd nanoparticles to reduce CO2, and holes oxidize Pd2+ sites to Pd4+ species that catalyze H2O splitting to OH* and H*. The resulting H* spills onto adjacent Pd nanoparticles to support proton&#8208;coupled CO2 reduction, whereas OH* is oxidized by Pd4+ to evolve O2, regenerating Pd2+, and closing the catalysis cycle. Importantly, the photoinduced Pd4+ sites dynamically modulate the local adsorption environment, weakening *CO binding on nearby Pd nanoparticles. This facilitates *CO desorption and hampers its hydrogenation to CH4, enabling high CO selectivity. The optimal catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 22.2&#160;mmol&#160;gPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with 95.7% selectivity, stably operating over 30 h.

         <title>Postassembly Modification of Interior Spaces Within M12L24 Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a procedure for the quantitative postassembly modification of the confined space within M12L24 nanospheres. Nanospheres with covalent linked interior pyridinium&#8208;carboxyaldehydes are prepared. These groups form imines with amine derivatives. The describe strategy establishes guidelines for postmodification of supramolecular systems, thus providing new opportunities for unique confined spaces.








Abstract
Post assembly modification (PAM) of coordination&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies has developed in the past 10 years as a tool that allows expansion of the chemical diversity available in supramolecular synthesis. In this contribution we apply PAM to enable the creation of M12L24 nanospheres with unique interior spaces. We introduce alkyl N&#8208;pyridinium carboxy aldehydes (ANCA) as ideal orthogonal functional group for PAM. The herein presented nanospheres undergo quantitative PAM with a variety of aniline derivatives, allowing the creation of hydrophobic, chiral, catalytic, and other confined spaces. As the parent spheres can be easily characterized before PAM, this methodology not only allows for the preparation of highly desirable multifunctional confined spaces but also serves with its post modulation possibilities as a fast and efficient tool for screening secondary interactions and confined spaces on probes of interest.

         <title>Predictable Modulation of a Spontaneous Post&#8208;translational Modification in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool is reported for studying methylglyoxal (MGO)&#8208;derived protein glycation by incorporating single amino acid mutations that predictably modulate glycation levels. Mass spectrometry of intact proteins and proteolytic digests reveal Tyr&#160;(or Glu)&#160;substitutions result in an increase&#160;(or decrease)&#160;in site&#8208;specific glycation, enabling precise control of glycation levels in future cellular studies.








Abstract
Glycation is a nonenzymatic posttranslational modification associated with aging and disease. Because it occurs spontaneously, it is extremely difficult to control the extent of glycation at distinct sites within target proteins, especially in cellular systems. Here, we report a chemical approach, referred to as &#8220;dialAGE&#8221;, that enables the site&#8208;specific control of protein glycation. This unique tool requires the introduction of just a single point mutation that modulates the glycation susceptibility of a nearby arginine. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, extensive mass spectrometry analysis was performed to confirm that dialAGE can modulate site&#8208;specific glycation levels at multiple arginine residues in ubiquitin in vitro, enabling both enhanced and diminished glycation. Introduction of dialAGE point mutations and/or glycation with the biologically relevant glycating agent methylglyoxal did not affect polyubiquitin chain formation using in vitro ubiquitination assays. Furthermore, we show that dialAGE can be used to modulate ubiquitin glycation levels in living mammalian cells. We, therefore, anticipate that this method will be particularly useful for enabling the study of glycation as a genuine, functional, and posttranslational modification.

         <title>Bimolecular Synergy Reshapes the Interfacial Reactivity of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimolecular synergistic post&#8208;treatment constructs an n&#160;=&#160;2 2D perovskite layer on perovskite surfaces via intermolecular interactions and local polarity regulation. This highly pure and stable 2D passivation layer contributes to wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices achieving a power conversion efficiency of 20.98% with notable operational stability, while 2&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices demonstrate an impressive efficiency of 28.35%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites have garnered significant attention owing to their extensive applicability in tandem photovoltaic devices. However, the conventional post&#8208;treatment strategy utilizing phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) frequently results in the formation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite structures with mixed n&#8208;values and the phase evolution under operating conditions, thereby constraining further enhancement of device performance and deteriorating the operation stability. Through intermolecular interactions and localized polarity modulation, this method facilitates cation exchange reactions between phenethylammonium (PEA+) and formamidinium (FA+) ions, enabling the formation of homogenized 2D perovskite layer with n&#160;=&#160;2 on WBG perovskite surface. Benefiting from the precisely defined 2D passivation layer, the WBG single&#8208;junction device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.98%, while the 2&#8208;terminal (2T) all&#8208;perovskite tandem device based on this strategy attains a PCE of 28.35%. This research underscores the benefits of bimolecular synergy in surface phase regulation and provides a promising pathway for advancing high&#8208;performance, stable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Stable Iminium Singlet and Triplet Diradical(oid)s with Intense NIR&#8208;II Absorptions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized and isolated a series of stable iminium diradical(oid)s, their ground state was unequivocally confirmed by EPR and SQUID experiments, and their structure and electronic properties were revealed. CNR2+ features an open shell singlet ground state, and CNR3+ has an open shell triplet ground state. Both the open shell CNR2+ and CNR3+ display distinctively narrow band&#8208;gaps and exhibit long wavelength absorption bands that extend up to approximately 2400 nm.








Abstract
This study presents the successful synthesis of a series of stable iminium diradical(oid)s. CNR1+OTf&#8722;, CNR2+OTf&#8722;, and CNR3+OTf&#8722; can be readily prepared by treating their corresponding methoxy precursors with triflate acid. Remarkably, they all display excellent stability under light and ambient conditions. CNR1+ exhibits a closed shell electronic feature, whereas CNR2+ features an open shell singlet ground state. CNR3+OTf&#8722; possess triplet ground electronic state, as evidenced by ESR and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. Through meticulous fitting of the SQUID data, a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#8710;ES&#8208;T) of +1.04&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 along with intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions (&#952;) of &#8208;28&#160;K were obtained. In comparison to CNR1+, both the open shell CNR2+ and CNR3+ display distinctively red shifted long wavelength absorption bands that extend up to approximately 2400&#160;nm. Such long wavelength absorption characteristics are quite scarce among organic materials. This research offers a novel approach for the design and synthesis of iminium diradical(oid)s, which feature tunable ground states and exhibit intense absorption in the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, opening up new possibilities in the field of organic materials research.

         <title>The Pentafluorophenyl Cation: A Superelectrophile and Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From radical to diradical cation. Photoionization (PI) of the thermally generated pentafluorophenyl radical yields the pentafluorophenyl cation in the gas phase. This cation is found to be a diradical with nearly degenerate open&#8208;shell singlet and triplet ground states, and it is even more unstable than the parent phenyl cation by &#8764;40&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
We report the first direct observation of the pentafluorophenyl cation in the gas phase via vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization (PI) of the thermally generated pentafluorophenyl radical. The reactive intermediates and stable reaction products were characterized utilizing photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation. Electron removal from the pentafluorophenyl radical yields the cation with an adiabatic ionization energy (AIE) of 9.84&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02&#160;eV. Threshold photoelectron spectra combined with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations show that the cation is described as a &#960;5&#963;1 diradical with an open&#8208;shell singlet (1A2) ground state, while the triplet (3A2) state lies only 1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 higher in energy. The closed&#8208;shell singlet (1A) state is highly distorted and lies &gt;4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 above the ground state. This unique aryl carbenium ion exhibits a &#8764;40&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 higher hydride affinity (HA) as compared to the parent phenyl cation, explaining its high reactivity and elusive character. In addition, the radical's reactivity was investigated upon hydrogen abstraction and unimolecular decomposition, forming tetrafluoro ortho&#8208;benzyne as well as smaller fluorinated species.

         <title>Targeted Discovery and Characterization of Type&#8208;II PKS&#8208;NRPS Hybrid DNA&#8208;Alkylating Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of DNA&#8208;alkylating antibiotics, xinghaicarcins, assembled by a type&#8208;II PKS&#8211;NRPS hybrid system was discovered by self&#8208;resistance gene&#8208;directed genome mining. They possess an intricate spiro&#8208;epoxide&#8208;bearing spiroketal heptacyclic scaffold with a pipecolic acid, fully characterized by co&#8208;crystallization. Xinghaicarcins show potent anticancer and antibacterial activity, which can be mitigated by resistance protein XhnU2.








Abstract
DNA alkylating natural products usually exhibit diverse bioactivity and serve as a crucial source of drug leads. Here, we employed genome mining guided by HTH&#8208;42 superfamily resistance gene to precisely discover a new class of DNA&#8208;alkylating antibiotics, xinghaicarcins, from Streptomyces xinghaiensis. They possess an intricate spiro&#8208;epoxide&#8208;bearing spiroketal heptacyclic scaffold fused with a pipecolic acid, assembled by a type II polyketide synthase&#8211;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid system. An aminotransferase XhnB1 and a methyltransferase XhnM are identified to catalyze the formation of N&#8208;methylated pipecolic acid building block, leading to the completion of the polyketide&#8211;peptide backbone. The identification of XhnM facilitated stereochemical determination of six chiral centers in xinghaicarcins by co&#8208;crystallization. Notably, xinghaicarcins exhibit potent antibacterial activity against drug&#8208;resistant pathogens and cytotoxicity against multiple cancer cell lines. Additionally, the HTH&#8208;42 superfamily resistant protein, XhnU2, was characterized to mitigate xinghaicarcin&#8208;induced genotoxicity. This work provides comprehensive insights into structure, biosynthesis, bioactivity, and self&#8208;resistance mechanisms of xinghaicarcins, expanding diversity of DNA alkylating natural products.

This study reveals that potential&#8208;driven charge effects play a pivotal role in governing Na storage under realistic operating conditions. To capture these effects, we develop a charge&#8208;dependent computational model that explicitly incorporates potential&#8208;induced charge dynamics. By addressing key limitations of conventional charge&#8208;neutral approaches, this work resolves long&#8208;standing theory&#8208;experiment inconsistencies and provides a powerful framework for designing next&#8208;generation sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) storage in hard carbon (HC) is a fundamental electrochemical process for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, where adsorption energy critically influences charge/discharge rates and storage capacity. Accurate prediction of this energy is essential for designing of high&#8208;performance HC. Traditional quantum mechanical simulations often neglect charge effects from electrochemical potentials, leading to inaccurate adsorption energies and discrepancies with experiments. Here, we demonstrate that potential&#8208;driven charge effects play a pivotal role in governing Na storage under realistic conditions. To address this, we develop a charge&#8208;dependent computational model (CDM) that explicitly incorporates potential&#8208;induced charge dynamics. Using flat carbon layers as a model, we show that charge effects significantly influence the identification of active Na&#8208;storage sites and induce sodiation/desodiation voltage shifts exceeding&#160;1.1&#160;V relative to conventional charge&#8208;neutral models. These effects originate from distinct&#160;chemical reactivities between neutral and charged carbon. When extended to curved and defect&#8208;rich carbon&#8212;hallmarks of HC&#8212;CDM accurately predicts storage sites and voltage&#8208;capacity profiles that closely match experimental data. This work resolves long&#8208;standing theory&#8208;experiment inconsistencies and provides a powerful framework for designing next&#8208;generation sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Robust A&#8208;site Cation Engineering for Stable 2D High&#8208;n Tin Perovskite Homologs with Bridged Lasing Emission Gaps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating distinct A&#8208;site cations, a library of homologous 2D tin halide perovskites was synthesized. A&#8208;site cation engineering enables&#160;the continuous bandgap tuning (1.62&#8211;2.01&#160;eV) with minimal lattice mismatch (&lt;3.6%). The n&#160;=&#160;3 tin perovskites with multications exhibited exceptional phase stability, and the corresponding nanolasers bridged the emission gaps between single&#8208;A&#8208;cation analogs.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional high&#8208;n halide perovskites (e.g., n&#160;&#160;=&#160;3) offer a unique platform for stable, efficient optoelectronics by synergizing improved stability with bulk&#8208;like carrier transport. However, their development is hindered by the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between continuous bandgap tunability and structural integrity. Here, we report robust&#160;A&#8208;site cation engineering to overcome these limitations in n&#160;&#160;=&#160;3 tin perovskites. By incorporating distinct cations, we synthesized a library of homologous single crystals, including metastable&#160;(BA)2Cs2Sn3I10&#160;(BA+: butylammonium) via growth kinetics control. It is revealed that A&#8208;site cations critically govern structural symmetry, exciton&#8208;phonon coupling, lasing, etc. Tailoring cation composition enables&#160;the continuous bandgap tuning (1.62&#8211;2.01&#160;eV) with minimal lattice mismatch (&lt;3.6%). A&#8208;site cation engineering idealized the perovskite lattice and improved the crystal quality, e.g., the multication (BA)2Cs0.7MA0.4EA0.5GA0.4Sn3I10&#160;(MA+: methylammonium, EA+: ethylammonium, GA+: guanidinium) achieves a long carrier lifetime (15.1&#160;ns), nearly three times that of containing single A&#8208;site, and then increases diffusion length to &gt;1&#160;&#181;m. The n&#160;=&#160;3 tin perovskites with multication exhibited exceptional phase stability and the corresponding nanolaser bridged the emission gaps between single&#8208;A&#8208;cation analogs, delivering a low threshold and unprecedented stability.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Non&#8208;Photoisomerized Dissipative Self&#8208;Assembly System Through Transient Radical&#8208;Radical Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;powered dissipative self&#8208;assembly system based on photoexcited radicalization rather than common photoisomerization mechanism is presented, where naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives can be activated by light and convert to high&#8208;energy radical anion NDI&#9679;&#8722;. This results in a temporal self&#8208;assembled reconfiguration through transient spin&#8208;spin interactions. Reversal deactivation is spontaneous in ambient air without waste production, which can be used for developing light&#8208;programmed life&#8208;like materials.








Abstract
Living organisms inspire intensive exploration of artificial dissipative systems under far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics. Light, as an ideal fuel form, offers remote control, spatiotemporal precision, and no chemical waste. However, the energy dissipating mechanism behind current light&#8208;driven system hinges on photoisomerization. This strategy has to trade off the slow, incomplete tautomerization against the needs of rapid, dynamic material response. Here, we report a non&#8208;isomerized, light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly system based on photoexcited radicalization mechanism. Light can activate dipeptide&#8208;modified naphthalene diimide (NDI&#8208;GV) into high&#8208;energy radical anion NDI&#8208;GV&#9679;&#8722;, thus disrupting the initial &#960;&#8208;stacked ribbon architecture and triggering a reconfiguration into homochiral helical nanofibers through spin&#8208;spin interactions among the resulted radicals. In turn, ambient air spontaneously oxidizes NDI&#8208;GV&#9679;&#8722; to the ground state for resetting the system, during which an unusual solvent&#8208;involved feedback pathway sustaining the dissipative cycle is uncovered. Shifting light parameters or solvents to tune the kinetics of radical generation and deactivation enables temporal control of the assembly period and lifetime (&gt;10&#160;h). Combining the tunability of phase transition with the photochromism of NDIs, this system can be used for light&#8208;programmed information encryption and spatiotemporal patterning, which would inspire a non&#8208;photoisomerized paradigm of light&#8208;powered dissipative self&#8208;assembly and extend the boundaries of systems chemistry.

         <title>Evolution of CoxNiy Alloy Electronic Structure Buffered by Carbon Nanolayer to Tune Selective Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of electronic structure and its critical role for non&#8208;radical ROS generation via PMS was first investigated by carbon nanolayer&#8208;supported CoxNiy alloys (CoxNiy@CNT) with preset atomic Ni/Co ratio. The carbon nanolayer, as formed in situ with controllable lattice distance, exhibits the unique electron buffering effect to replenish or accept electron to CoxNiy, thereby driving selective generation of surface PMS* or free 1O2.








Abstract
Generation of non&#8208;radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is desired to drive selective Fenton&#8208;like reactions and strongly affected by the electronic structure of catalyst. While the static structure&#8211;activity relationship of catalysts is well explored, how the evolution of electronic structure dynamically affects the ROS generation remains poorly understood. This study fabricated carbon nanolayer&#8208;supported CoxNiy alloys (CoxNiy@CNT) with preset atomic Ni/Co ratio (x/y&#160;=&#160;1:3, 2:2, 3:1) to probe the dynamic evolution of electronic structure and its subsequent role for the generation of non&#8208;radical ROS. During catalytic PMS activation, the paired electrons of O 2p in PMS fill the corresponding hybrid orbitals of Co to form coordinative Co&#8212;O endowed with paired/unpaired electrons. The carbon nanolayer support, as in situ formed with controllable lattice distance, exhibits the unique electron buffering effect to replenish electron to Co1Ni3 or accept electron from Co3Ni1, thereby driving selective generation of surface PMS* or free 1O2 respectively. Further, the specific reaction preferences of PMS* and 1O2 toward different organic contaminants were elucidated, and a combined process integrating both alloys was proposed to efficiently treat actual hospital wastewater. Overall, this study offers a molecule&#8208;level design of bimetallic alloys with tunable electronic structure for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Lewis Acidity&#8208;Governed Ion Exchange and Record Birefringence in A&#8242;[Ag3(PO3F)2]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH4[Ag3(PO3F)2] achieves record&#8208;breaking birefringence, stemming from the P&#8211;F alignment, silver polyhedron distortion, and hydrogen bonding in A&#8242;[Ag3(PO3F)2] series as a model platform for cation&#8208;size&#8208;mediated ABUCBs configuration control. 








Abstract
Four monofluorophosphates, A&#8242;[Ag3(PO3F)2] (A&#8242;&#160;=&#160;Ag+, K+, Rb+, NH4+), with layered sandwich structures were synthesized. Systematic characterization reveals that the Lewis acidity gradient of A&#8242; cations (Ag+&#160;&gt;&#160;Rb+&#160;&#8776; K+&#160;&gt;&#160;NH4+) governs their distinct ion&#8208;exchange kinetics, where Ag+ substitution requires 7 days for Rb+/K+ but 14 days for NH4+. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that optical anisotropy primarily stems from the alignment of P&#9472;F bonds in [PO3F]2&#8722; tetrahedra, as well as the alignment of dipole moment of [Ag(1)O4]7&#8722; tetrahedra. Compound with smaller angular deviations from the dielectric axis (&#945; and &#946;) yielding enhanced anisotropy. Remarkably, NH4&#8314;&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding introduces additional anisotropy, enabling NH4[Ag3(PO3F)2] to achieve record birefringence (&#8710;nobv.&#160;=&#160;0.101&#160;versus &#8710;ncal.&#160;=&#160;0.099 at 546&#160;nm) among known fluorophosphates, doubling NaNH4PO3F&#183;H2O's prior maximum (&#8710;nobv.&#160;=&#160;0.053 at 589&#160;nm) and surpassing SnPO3F's lone&#8208;pair&#8208;driven anisotropy (&#8710;ncal.&#160;=&#160;0.082 at 546&#160;nm) by 20%.

         <title>Spatially Engineered Ternary Schottky/S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially integrated Nb2C/Nb2O5/ZnO heterostructure couples Schottky and S&#8208;scheme interfaces to promote directional charge separation and photothermal&#8208;assisted CO2 activation, enabling efficient photoreduction without molecular cocatalysts or sacrificial agents through synergistic interfacial engineering and carrier dynamic control.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into solar fuels presents a promising strategy for carbon mitigation and sustainable energy conversion. However, single&#8208;component photocatalysts suffer from inefficient charge separation, while binary heterojunctions&#8212;even with cocatalysts assistance&#8212;often undergo rapid Coulombic recombination due to timescale mismatches between ultrafast charge transfer and slower surface reaction kinetics. To overcome these limitations, a spatially engineered Nb2C/Nb2O5/ZnO ternary heterostructure is developed by anchoring ZnO quantum dots (QDs) onto Nb2O5 nanorods grown in situ from Nb2C MXene. This architecture integrates an Nb2O5/ZnO S&#8208;scheme heterojunction and an Nb2C/Nb2O5 Schottky junction, sharing Nb2O5 as a central mediator, thereby establishing bidirectional interfacial electric fields (IEFs) that direct photogenerated electrons toward ZnO and holes toward Nb2C. In situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveal interface&#8208;specific electronic interactions and time&#8208;resolved carrier dynamics, confirming efficient and spatially resolved charge migration across the decoupled interfaces. This spatial charge separation effectively suppresses Coulombic recombination and prolongs carrier lifetimes. Additionally, the photothermal effect of Nb2C MXene enhances CO2 chemisorption and activation at defective ZnO QDs. These synergistic effects collectively enable high&#8208;efficiency CO2 photoreduction without molecular cocatalysts or sacrificial agents, providing a mechanistically distinct and scalable approach for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn and Ir Synergistic Modulation of Substrate and Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse Zn1N3O3 and Ir4+ synergistically modulate substrate and active sites for high&#8208;performance ammonia oxidation. Atomically dispersed Zn single atoms in an N,O&#8208;doped carbon support serve as dedicated *OH&#8208;adsorption sites, while Ir&#8208;modulated Pt(100) nanocubes selectively activate NH3.








Abstract
A rationally designed, bifunctional ammonia&#8208;oxidation catalyst spatially decouples NH3 activation and *OH adsorption to overcome the intrinsic trade&#8208;off of single&#8208;component systems. Atomically dispersed Zn single atoms in an N,O&#8208;doped carbon support (Zn1/NOC) serve as dedicated *OH&#8208;adsorption sites, while Ir&#8208;modulated Pt(100) nanocubes selectively activate NH3. Comprehensive structural characterization (AC HAADF&#8208;STEM, XPS, XANES, EXAFS) confirms Zn&#8208;N3O3 coordination and atomically isolated Zn centers. Electrochemical&#8208;kinetic analysis, mechanistic spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal that Zn1/NOC lowers the *OH&#8208;adsorption energy by 0.84&#160;eV (to &#8722;0.98&#160;eV versus &#8722;0.14&#160;eV on Pt), facilitating the dehydrogenation steps and reducing surface poisoning. Simultaneously, traces of stabilized Ir4+&#8208;decorated Pt cubes enhance NH3 dissociation kinetics to form N2. The catalyst demonstrates a specific activity of 3.80&#160;mA cm&#8722;2PGMs, exceeding the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. When deployed in a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly direct ammonia fuel cell, the catalyst achieves a maximum current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 18&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, representing a significant improvement over previously reported systems, with &#8764;250% increase over Ptnp&#8211;C || Pt/C and more than double monofunctional systems. This work demonstrates a generalizable strategy for engineering spatially decoupled active sites in multistep electrochemical reactions, paving the way for high&#8208;performance ammonia fuel cells and beyond.

         <dc:description>
An in situ interface reaction strategy has been developed to prepare perovskite films with strong quantum confinement, yielding stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 468&#160;nm. Consequently, the resulting deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes achieve an impressive peak external quantum efficiency of 16.3%. Additionally, this strategy enables large&#8208;scale bright deep&#8208;blue devices and high&#8208;quality active&#8208;matrix displays.








Abstract
The development of blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is critical for advancing next&#8208;generation display technologies. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide blue perovskites remains challenging due to their intrinsic vulnerability to high defect densities, ion migration, and inefficient charge transport. To address this, we introduce a rapid in situ interface reaction at the buried interface between the perovskite layer and the underlying poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) film. This engineered interface reaction represents a novel method for preparing high&#8208;quality deep&#8208;blue CsPb(Br/Cl)3 films. By incorporating lithium salicylate (SAL) as a reaction initiator into the perovskite precursor, a proton exchange is triggered between PEDOT:PSS and SAL, resulting in the formation of a multifunctional PSS&#8208;Li interfacial layer. This layer modulates perovskite nucleation and growth, producing compact, uniform, and small&#8208;grained deep&#8208;blue perovskite films with reduced trap densities and enhanced quantum confinement. Combined with optimized charge dynamics, the resulting spectrally stable deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 16.3% at 468&#160;nm. This approach facilitates the successful integration of uniform and high&#8208;clarity active&#8208;matrix displays on thin&#8208;film transistor circuit substrates.

         <title>3D Covalent Arsenic Polyoxomolybdate&#8208;Organic Polymer with Ultrahigh Photocatalytic Oxidative Ability for Aromatic C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D covalent &#949;&#8208;Keggin&#8208;type arsenic polyoxomolybdate (AsPOM)&#8208;organic polymer (POF&#8208;2) is successfully synthesized by strategically balancing the solubility of (p&#8208;H3NC6H4As)4Mo12O46 (AsPOM) with 1,4&#8208;bi(3&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)benzene (BDOEB) organic linkers. POF&#8208;2 effectively integrates the strong oxidative ability of polyoxometalates (POMs) and the O2 activation ability of covalent organic polymers, exhibiting an ultrahigh photocatalytic oxidative activity for the efficient activation of aromatic C&#9472;H bonds.








Abstract
The photocatalytic activation of inert aromatic C&#9472;H bonds under mild conditions remains a major challenge due to the inherent stability of sp2 C&#9472;H bonds and the lack of efficient, selective heterogeneous photocatalysts. Herein, by strategically balancing the solubility of aniline&#8208;functionalized arsenic polyoxomolybdate (AsPOM) with the organic linker of 1,4&#8208;bi(3&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)benzene (BDOEB), a new 3D covalent AsPOM&#8208;organic polymer, termed POF&#8208;2, was successfully prepared. Its short&#8208; to medium&#8208;range ordered structure was resolved using the advanced total scattering atomic pair distribution function (PDF). The unique architecture of POF&#8208;2 synergistically combines the strong oxidative capability of AsPOM with the tunable light absorption and oxygen activation ability of organic monomers, narrowing the bandgap from 3.13&#160;eV (AsPOM) to 2.28&#160;eV (POF&#8208;2) and extending light absorption to 575&#160;nm. Under ambient conditions with low&#8208;energy visible&#8208;light irradiation (10&#160;W LED), POF&#8208;2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance in aromatic C&#9472;H bromination and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion and&#160;&gt;99% selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the well&#8208;defined donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure of POF&#8208;2 facilitates rapid hole (h+)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H activation on AsPOM nodes and selective 1O2 generation on BDOEB linkers, avoiding nonproductive substrate mineralization. This work not only demonstrates a new 3D covalent AsPOM&#8208;organic polymer for C&#9472;H functionalization but also provides a blueprint for designing molecularly precise, multifunctional photocatalysts for sustainable organic synthesis.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Azides and Selenoalkynes with Built&#8208;in &#8220;Catch&#8208;and&#8208;Release&#8221; Functionality</title>

A highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of azides and selenoalkynes has been developed. This process is robust in air and water as well as biological media, including PBS and cell lysate. Owing to the unique advantage of facile oxidative cleavage of the C&#9472;Se bond, this reaction features a built&#8208;in &#8220;catch&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; functionality that has potential applications in biological systems.








Abstract
Click reactions with a &#8220;catch&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; functionality featuring both cross&#8208;linking and bond cleavage may have unique biomedical applications. However, despite the high demand, such reactions are rarely known in the toolbox of biochemists. Herein we introduce a robust click reaction of selenoalkynes that not only facilitates mild cross&#8208;linking with azides but also permits exceptionally facile cleavage of the C&#9472;Se bond in the adducts. This highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed protocol features high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and good tolerance of functional groups and solvents. The compatibility with air and water as well as biomolecules has been demonstrated in parallel with the &#8220;catch&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; functionality.

         <title>Surface Reforming of Hard Carbon During Battery Rest for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;sec&#8208;Butoxyaluminoxytriethoxysilane (DSB) is theoretically screened from a series of alkyl oxides of heteroatoms as an electrolyte additive for hard carbon (HC) in sodium ion batteries. The reaction of DSB with the detrimental species in the electrolyte reduces surface defects, regulates pore size, and promotes the formation of NaF in the SEI, improving the electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The surface characteristics of hard carbon markedly affect its electrochemical performance. Here, a distinct surface modification of hard carbon (HC), which is achieved by electrolyte additives during cell aging, is reported. Di&#8208;sec&#8208;Butoxyaluminoxytriethoxysilane (DSB) is selected from a series of alkyl oxides of heteroatoms based on Wiberg bond order of X&#9472;O (X&#160;=&#160;Si, P, S, and B) and the change in Gibbs free energy of hydrolysis reaction. The Si&#9472;O&#9472;Al bonds in DSB exhibit high reactivity toward the deleterious species in the electrolyte, resulting in the formation of deposits on the surface of hard carbon. These deposits protect the anode surface and alter the pore structures. As a result, hard carbon exhibits an increased initial Coulombic efficiency of 83.5% and a capacity retention of 90.5% after 1500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. The simplicity and versatility of this approach pave the way for the commercial application of hard carbon.

         <dc:description>Key molecular intermediates formed in the early stages of carbon nanodot (CND) formation from arginine and ethylenediamine were identified. The resulting CNDs were isolated and thoroughly characterized by several techniques. Multi&#8208;detection gel permeation chromatography enabled absolute determination of the molecular weight, dispersity, and hydrodynamic diameter, as well as estimation of the number of reactive surface amines per particle.








Abstract
Understanding the mechanistic pathways underlying carbon nanodot (CND) formation is essential for the rational design of synthesis strategies and the development of well&#8208;defined nanomaterials. In this work, we combine chromatographic isolation, spectroscopic characterization, and synthetic validation to identify key molecular intermediates in the early stages of CND formation from arginine (Arg) and ethylenediamine (EDA) under hydrothermal conditions. Using reverse&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, 1H/13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, we isolate and structurally confirm multiple reaction intermediates, including species arising from Arg cyclization and EDA&#8208;derived condensation products. Each proposed intermediate was validated via direct synthesis and comparative analysis. Fully formed CNDs were then isolated and extensively characterized through several techniques. Multi&#8208;detection gel permeation chromatography enabled the determination of absolute number average molecular weight (Mn&#160;=&#160;4,400&#160;&#177;&#160;458&#160;g mol&#8722;1), dispersity (&#272;&#160;=&#160;1.34), and hydrodynamic diameter (2.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm). Quantification of amine functionalities using Kaiser test and 19F NMR, upon condensation with a fluorinated aldehyde probe, established the presence of 6&#8211;7 amines per particle. Together, this systematic approach not only elucidates the mechanistic origin of CND formation but also establishes a robust framework for molecular&#8208;level CND design and functionalization.

         <title>Stable Luminescent Radicals with Efficient Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two luminescent radicals have been synthesized that feature through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states. The spatial separation and non&#8208;bonding character between the donor and radical units suppress electron&#8208;vibrational coupling, resulting in CZP&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM showing a photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 64.3% and an ultralow non&#8208;radiative decay rate of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8310; s&#8722;1. Weak orbital coupling leads to non&#8208;Aufbau electronic structures, thereby enhancing the radical stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance luminescent radicals featuring donor&#8208;radical (D&#8208;R) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited states have emerged as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on through&#8208;bond charge&#8208;transfer (TBCT) mechanisms. In this work, we report the first examples of luminescent radicals based on TTM (tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical) with through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states, represented by TPA&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM and CZP&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM. Spatial separation and non&#8208;bonding character between the donor and radical units minimizes electron&#8208;vibrational coupling and effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay. As a result, CZP&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM exhibits an outstanding photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 64.3% and an ultralow non&#8208;radiative decay rate of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1, among the lowest ever reported for luminescent radicals. Furthermore, the reduced electronic coupling leads to non&#8208;Aufbau electronic structures, enhancing radical stability. These findings establish TSCT as a powerful design strategy for high&#8208;performance and stable luminescent radicals, opening new avenues for open&#8208;shell optoelectronic materials.

         <title>A Chiral Organic Radical Ferroelectric with Magnetic Circular Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first chiral organic radical ferroelectric crystals that exhibit both paramagnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature, along with a pronounced magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) effect. The natural circular dichroism (CD) signal of these crystals can be modulated and even reversed by an external magnetic field of 1.6&#160;T, demonstrating a remarkable magneto&#8208;optical response.








Abstract
Chiral ferroelectrics are attracting tremendous interest because of their unique intrinsic chirality and various intriguing optical properties, such as natural circular dichroism (NCD) effects. However, the magnetic CD (MCD), a kind of important magneto&#8208;optical effect, has never been explored in chiral ferroelectrics. Herein, through implementing a homochiral strategy on organic radical charge&#8208;transfer complexes, we designed a pair of chiral organic radical ferroelectric crystals, R&#8208; and S&#8208;[TBSQ][TCNQ] (TBSQ&#160;=&#160;3&#8208;((tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)quinuclidine, TCNQ&#160;=&#160;tetracyanoquinodimethane), which show both paramagnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature. Notably, the chiral transfer from homochiral R/S&#8208;TBSQ+ to TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; radical makes R&#8208; and S&#8208;[TBSQ][TCNQ] can produce remarkable NCD signal in the absorbance region of TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; radical. More importantly, the CD signal can be modulated and reversed by an external magnetic field of 1.6&#160;T, showing a remarkable magneto&#8208;optical response. The magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) effect is further demonstrated with the strength gMCD being &#8764;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;T&#8722;1 at about 600&#160;nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on chiral ferroelectrics with MCD effect. Our findings shed light on the exploration of magneto&#8208;optical effects in chiral ferroelectrics and stimulate further study on the chemical design of chiral radical ferroelectrics.

         <title>Deep Eutectic Solvent Binder Facilitating Reaction Kinetics of Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep eutectic solvent (DES) binder comparing citric acid and betaine (CB) is developed for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries using the microwave irradiation method. A highly reversible hydrogen bond network is conducive to providing exceptional binding capability, excellent self&#8208;healing ability, and flame&#8208;retardant performance, while Li+ flux is directly regulated by the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) of DES. 








Abstract
Existing binders fail to integrate all designed functionalities, including the polysulfide shuttle effect, sluggish kinetic transformation, electrode volume variation, slow Li&#8314; transfer, and flammable characteristics. Herein, the microwave irradiation method is used to prepare deep eutectic solvent (DES) binder; with the rapid conduction and full utilization of energy, citric acid and betaine (CB) binder is formed in a flash. Intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between C and B provide robust adhesion, self&#8208;healing capability, and flame&#8208;retardant properties. More importantly, Li&#8314; flux is directly improved by hydrogen bond acceptor (B) of DES rather than introducing additional segments or chemical treatment; then the redox kinetics are significantly promoted and the polysulfide shuttle is further suppressed. The types and dynamics of the hydrogen bonds are observed via Raman and dynamic mechanical analysis, while effective LiPS adsorption capability is confirmed through theoretical calculations and in situ Raman measurements. Furthermore, rapid LiPS conversion is verified by nucleation/dissolution experiments of Li2S and distribution of relaxation times (DRTs) analysis, and nucleation transformation ratio (NTR) calculation shows the similar result. Benefiting from the superior merits of the DES binder, lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) battery presents stable cycling at 5&#160;C with 61.3% capacity retention after 300 cycles.

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter Through Steric Presubstitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE Over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple resonance greenish emitter with extended skeleton is tailor&#8208;designed using a bulk tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups presubstituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as bridge, not only suppressing the intermolecular aggregation&#8208;induced intermolecular interactions to maintain a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 22&#160;nm in device but also achieving a high external quantum efficiency of 41.0% with small efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric presubstitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8211;Friedel&#8211;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter, therefore, achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22&#160;nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21&#160;nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5&#160;lm W&#8722;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. This work establishes a presubstitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.

         <title>Embedding Metallosalen Active Sites in Zr&#8208;MOF for Enhanced Selective Syngas Production from CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 39, September 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed a novel strategy by integration of metallosalen active sites and Zr&#8208;MOF, to promote the selective production of syngas through photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Mechanistic studies reveal that this high catalytic activity and tunable selectivity are due to catalyst's high CO2 capture capability and rapid electron&#8208;hole separation kinetics.








Abstract
Selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction to product syngas remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy by integration of metallosalen (M&#8208;Salen) active sites and Zr&#8208;MOF, to promote the selective production of syngas through photocatalytic CO2 and H2O reduction. A series of M&#8208;Salen (Co, Co2, Cu, Cu2) with carboxylic groups were embedded into a Zr&#8208;MOF (NKM&#8208;908) by replacing the terminal coordinated &#8208;OH&#8208;/H2O on the Zr6 clusters. The integration of M&#8208;Salen and NKM&#8208;908 significantly accelerate the transfer dynamics of photogenerated charge and promote CO2 enrichment around the M&#8208;Salen active sites. The M&#8208;Salen sites played a crucial role in enhancing CO production. Specifically, the mononuclear Co&#8208;Salen exhibits stronger CO2 adsorption and activation capabilities than the binuclear Co2&#8208;Salen, with enhanced *CO2 coverage. In addition, the Co&#8208;based salen catalyst exhibits a lower energy barrier for *CO desorption&#8212;the rate&#8208;determining step&#8212;compared to its Cu&#8208;based counterpart. As a result, the Co&#8208;NKM&#8208;908 exhibited optimal performance in photocatalytic CO2 and H2O conversion, achieving a high CO production rate of 1.92&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a H2 production rate of 1.52&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with a standard syngas CO/H2 ratio of 1.3/1.

         <title>Mechanically Tunable Slide&#8208;Ring Polymers via Photo&#8208;Regulated Topological Control</title>

         <dc:description>
We developed light&#8208;responsive slide&#8208;ring polymer networks whose mechanical properties can be tuned through photoisomerization of the incorporated azobenzene units. The trans&#8208;state permits unhindered macrocycle sliding, yielding ductile materials, while UV&#8208;induced cis&#8208;configuration restricts macrocycle mobility to double Young's modulus. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions.








Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic dynamic control of polymer topology to modulate material properties on demand remains a grand challenge in polymer science. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive slide&#8208;ring polymer network whose mechanical properties can be tuned through photoisomerization of incorporated azobenzene units. In the trans&#8208;state, azobenzene enables unhindered sliding of macrocycles along the polymer backbone, yielding a softer, more ductile material. UV&#8208;induced switching to the sterically demanding cis&#8208;configuration restricts ring mobility, thereby increasing the Young's modulus by two&#8208;fold while reducing toughness. Control experiments with noninterlocked analogs revealed the opposite mechanical response&#8212;light&#8208;induced softening&#8212;highlighting the pivotal role of topology in property regulation. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions. This work establishes a versatile strategy for post&#8208;synthetic topological control via molecular photoswitches, enabling the design of adaptive polymers with stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanical properties for applications in smart materials.

Channel confinement via rigid cylindrical pillaring in a MOF framework enables molecular sieving through elliptical windows, offering a blueprint for ambient&#8208;condition xylene isomer separation.








Abstract
Xylene isomer separation is a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the nearly identical properties of para&#8208;xylene (PX), meta&#8208;xylene (MX), ortho&#8208;xylene (OX), and ethylbenzene (EB). Here, we report a rationally designed pillar&#8208;layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni&#8208;HDB, incorporating a cylindrical 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) pillar that blocks lateral channels and directs molecular transport through elliptical windows (3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;6.7&#160;&#197;2). These apertures closely match the dimensions of PX and EB, enabling kinetic sieving. As a result, Ni&#8208;HDB exhibits high selectivity for PX and EB, moderate selectivity for MX, and exclusion of OX under ambient conditions. It achieves record liquid&#8208;phase selectivities for EB/OX (1943), PX/OX (951), and MX/OX (158), along with high PX and MX adsorption capacities. Comparative studies with isoreticular analogues confirm that DABCO&#8208;driven confinement is key to enhancing size&#8208;based selectivity. Density functional theory calculations indicate kinetic preference for PX and EB, thermodynamic favorability for MX, and exclusion of OX. Ni&#8208;HDB also shows excellent thermal and structural stability, with no performance loss over ten cycles. These results highlight the importance of channel geometry in MOFs and provide a framework for developing next&#8208;generation adsorbents for energy&#8208;efficient hydrocarbon separations.

Acridinium&#8208;based COFs (Acr&#8208;TAPB and Acr&#8208;TADB) are synthesized via a single&#8208;atom oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen replacement from xanthylium precursors. The resulting COFs possess high crystallinity, stability, redox activity, and efficient charge separation. Notably, Acr&#8208;TADB serves as an efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative nucleophilic substitution and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions, enabling gram&#8208;scale synthesis in both batch and flow reactors with excellent stability. 








Abstract
The rational synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with customized functionalities and enhanced stability requires innovative bond&#8208;forming strategies beyond conventional dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we report a novel single&#8208;atom skeletal editing approach to construct acridinium&#8208;based crystalline COFs through an irreversible Katritzky&#8208;type reaction. This strategy enables precise transformation of 9,9&#8242;&#8208;(2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylxanthylium) with either 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8201;(TAPB)&#8201;or&#8201;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene (TADB) into acridinium&#8208;linked COFs, denoted as Acr&#8208;TAPB and Acr&#8208;TADB, respectively. The transformation proceeds via a unique single&#8208;atom oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen replacement, converting the xanthylium precursor into acridinium frameworks. The resulting COFs exhibit high crystallinity, robust stability, strong redox ability, and efficient charge separation. Notably, Acr&#8208;TADB functions as a highly effective metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative nucleophilic substitution and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions, supporting gram&#8208;scale synthesis in both batch and flow reactors with excellent stability. This work establishes skeletal editing as a powerful strategy for engineering functionalized COF architectures for advanced applications.

         <title>Generally Grafting Hydrophobic Polymer Brushes in Pure Water Through SIP of Phase Transfer Delivered Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and versatile strategy for surface&#8208;initiated controlled radical polymerization (PTD&#8208;SIP), which employs methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) as a phase&#8208;transfer agent. This approach enables the surface&#8208;initiated polymerization of hydrophobic monomers in a pure aqueous phase, allowing precise synthesis of hydrophobic polymer brushes with different topologies and tunable physicochemical properties of material surface and interface.








Abstract
Hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes hold significant potential in antifouling, energy, medical, and lubrication applications. Because of rigorous polymerization conditions and requirements of organic solvents, research on hydrophobic polymer brushes is limited. Herein, we report a simple but efficient surface&#8208;initiated polymerization technique based on phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;delivered hydrophobic monomers (named PTD&#8208;SIP) that enables generally grafting hydrophobic brushes using minimal chemicals in an oxygen&#8208;tolerant environment with high end&#8208;group reactivity. This method employs methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CD) as a transport carrier to deliver hydrophobic monomers in water, eliminating the need for organic solvents. The PTD&#8208;SIP method enables easy alternating or simultaneous grafting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers and is applicable to various substrates and monomer types. Furthermore, reversible structural color has been achieved through rewritable surface&#8208;grafted polymer brushes, while permanent inorganic hybrid coatings provided expanded opportunities for applications in optics and tribology. These features make water&#8208;based hydrophobic polymer brushes a powerful tool for developing high&#8208;performance interfacial materials.

         <title>Photochargeable Nanopores in Gas Permselective Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic framework, a photochargeable CO2 permselective mixed&#8208;matrix membrane is realized. Photocharging leads to enhanced CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 permselectivity.








Abstract
Gas permselective membranes are inherently constrained by a trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity. Overcoming this limitation is key to enabling broader industrial adoption, and advanced porous materials&#8212;particularly metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8212;has emerged as promising candidate. Yet, to truly rival established separation technologies such as, distillation, pressure swing adsorption and chemisorption, innovative design strategies remain essential. Traditionally, efforts to surpass the trade&#8208;off have focused on regulating porosity, pore architecture, pore surface chemical functionality, and macroscopic transport pathways (particle morphology). These modifications are achieved either through bottom&#8208;up synthetic approaches or by employing external stimuli such as light, pressure, or electric fields. In this work, we introduce a photochargeable membrane that enhances gas permselectivity through precise, molecule&#8208;specific interactions&#8212;without altering the underlying porous architecture. This is achieved by incorporating a nanoporous MOF, constructed from redox&#8208;active organic ligands, as filler in a mixed matrix membrane. Upon photoexcitation, ligand&#8211;ligand charge separation yields stable pore surface charges, facilitating selective interactions with quadrupolar CO2. This specific interaction enhances CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 permselectivity, surpassing the Robeson upper bound. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept can be explored for mixed and high purity gas feed preparation.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective &#945;&#9472;C&#9472;H Functionalization of Saturated Heterocycles via Copper&#8208;Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective C&#945;&#9472;H functionalization of saturated heterocycles with chemically similar C&#9472;H bonds is realized for the first time by copper&#8208;photoredox catalysis. This undirected strategy exploits copper photocatalyst's ability to mediate both substrate activation and photoinduced energy transfer, offering excellent site&#8208;selectivity complementary to previous HAT events. Such a general and new protocol utilizes air as the HAT precursor and oxidant.








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective &#945;&#9472;C&#9472;H functionalization of saturated heterocycles is of particular importance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry, but the intrinsic chemical inertness of saturated heterocycles renders the transformation difficult. Furthermore, site&#8208;selectivity remains a significant challenge, especially among multiple C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds with comparable chemical properties. Herein, an unprecedented site&#8208;selective C&#945;&#9472;H functionalization of saturated heterocycles by copper&#8208;photoredox catalysis is described. This undirected approach exploits a novel copper photocatalyst to mediate both substrate activation and photoinduced energy transfer, enabling site&#8208;selective functionalization of cyclic C&#945;&#9472;H bonds in the presence of competitive C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. Mechanistic studies reveal that the excellent site&#8208;selectivity stems from the coordination effect between the saturated heterocycle and copper/ligand complex, which makes the cyclic C&#945;&#9472;H bond more acidic and weaker in bond strength, thereby increasing the reactivity differences among similar C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. The use of dual&#8208;role air bypasses exogenous HAT reagents and oxidants required in previous methods. This mild and sustainable protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent site&#8208;selectivity, and high functional group compatibility, providing a new and site&#8208;selective reactivity mode for rapid diversification of &#945;&#9472;C&#9472;H bonds.

         <title>Channel&#8208;Pocket Ultra&#8208;Micropore Configuration in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Simultaneous High Xe Capture and Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a threefold interpenetrated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with a channel&#8208;pocket ultra&#8208;micropore configuration. This HOF achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation.








Abstract
Development of energy&#8208;efficient physisorbents for xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation is highly essential to produce high&#8208;purity noble gases and control the pollution of radioactive isotopes. Porous organic materials are very promising for gas separation due to their advantages of low regeneration energy, high moisture resistance, good solution processability and easy regeneration. However, their nonpolar pore surfaces lack strong sorbate&#8211;sorbent interactions, leading to the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between Xe capacity and selectivity that severely delimit their separation efficiency. Herein, we report a strategy of designing channel&#8208;pocket ultra&#8208;micropore configuration in a threefold interpenetrated HOF (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;6a) for achieving simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation. This channel&#8208;pocket ultra&#8208;micropore structure can provide the size&#8208;matched pore channels and cavities (4.7 and 4.4&#160;&#197;) to offer strong pore confinement for highly selective binding of Xe, and also maximize the usage of pore spaces for high surface area (1113&#160;m2 g&#8722;1) to target large Xe adsorption. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;6a thus achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe uptake (3.3&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) and record Xe/Kr selectivity (23.5) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, surpassing all the reported porous organic materials. The adsorption binding of Xe and Kr was visualized by gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;6a crystal structures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate its exceptional separation capacities for actual Xe/Kr mixtures under ambient conditions, affording the record&#8208;high dynamic selectivity (13.7) among porous organic materials.

Porous organic materials are very promising for gas separation due to their advantages of low regeneration energy, high moisture resistance, good solution processability and easy regeneration. However, their nonpolar pore surfaces lack strong sorbate&#8211;sorbent interactions, leading to the intrinsic trade-off between Xe capacity and selectivity that severely delimit their separation efficiency. Herein, we report a strategy of designing channel-pocket ultra-micropore configuration in a threefold interpenetrated HOF (ZJU-HOF-6a) for achieving simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation. This channel-pocket ultra-micropore structure can provide the size-matched pore channels and cavities (4.7 and 4.4&#160;&#197;) to offer strong pore confinement for highly selective binding of Xe, and also maximize the usage of pore spaces for high surface area (1113&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to target large Xe adsorption. ZJU-HOF-6a thus achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe uptake (3.3&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and record Xe/Kr selectivity (23.5) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, surpassing all the reported porous organic materials. The adsorption binding of Xe and Kr was visualized by gas-loaded ZJU-HOF-6a crystal structures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate its exceptional separation capacities for actual Xe/Kr mixtures under ambient conditions, affording the record-high dynamic selectivity (13.7) among porous organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable and Programmable Al8 Macrocycles for Advanced Dielectrics: Uniting High Permittivity, Minimal Loss, and Robust Moisture Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through tunable macrocycles surface engineering, we developed solution&#8208;processable aluminum molecular ring (Al8)&#8208;based dielectric materials. Guided by theoretical calculations, the metal center engineering strategy significantly improved material synthesis efficiency. The designed Al8&#8208;based materials effectively addressed critical issues of conventional Al2O3 fillers, including interfacial hydrolysis and uneven polarization, achieving synergistic optimization of high permittivity, low loss, and superior moisture resistance.








Abstract
The development of polymer composite dielectrics exhibiting high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, and excellent environmental stability is essential for enhancing field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) performance and reliability. While conventional high&#8208;&#954; materials like Al2O3 suffer from surface hydrolysis&#8208;induced polarization inhomogeneity, we present herein a molecular engineering solution through solution&#8208;processable and structurally programmable Al8 macrocycles. By employing computationally guided metal center and macrocycle surface engineering, we achieved highly efficient synthesis of solution&#8208;processable Al8&#8208;based dielectric materials. The resulting series of 10 structurally programmed Al8 macrocycles creates tailored electronic microenvironments, delivering exceptional dielectric properties: a threefold enhancement in dielectric constant compared to pure polymer matrices, remarkably low dielectric loss (tan &#948; = 0.064), and superior humidity resistance versus conventional Al2O3 fillers. This work establishes a comprehensive materials paradigm that simultaneously optimizes the critical dielectric parameters (&#954;, tan &#948;, and moisture resistance) while demonstrating the versatility of cluster molecular design.

         <title>Asymmetric Diamine Synthesis for Covalent Organic Frameworks: Boosted Photocatalytic Performance by Restricting &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine Bond Twist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing nonlinear connections through C1h ligand, the twist of linkers caused by &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond is restricted. This approach maintains the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, facilitating electron separation and transport, thereby boosting photocatalytic performance, such as the production of H2O2.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are typically formed by the covalent bonding of geometrically symmetrical linkers. In this work, an asymmetric (C1h symmetry) amine linker (2,6&#8208;diaminobenzothiazole) was employed to non&#8208;linearly connect and synthesize the COFs (TpBa) featuring &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond, which lead to the discovery of interesting &#8220;angle&#8208;induced restricted twist (AIRT)&#8221; effect. Compared with the COFs TpPa and TpDa with geometrically symmetrical linkers, the presence of asymmetric amine moieties in TpBa introduced certain angles between building blocks, mitigating the twist of the molecular plane caused by spatial steric hindrance on both sides of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bonds thereby preserving the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Although TpDa exhibited a more favorable charges structure and distribution for separation and transport, TpBa demonstrated superior H2O2 yield, suggesting the potential dominance of the AIRT effect under specific conditions. This work not only expands the option for COFs linker selection but also provides insights into boosting the photocatalytic performance of COFs.

         <title>Molecular Locking in Triplet Sensitization Amplifies Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular geometry matters: We employ nontoxic CuInS2 quantum dots to sensitize triplet fusion upconversion, achieving a 43&#8208;fold CPL amplification and high upconversion efficiency. DFT simulation reveals that the record glum originates from the structural rearrangement of the chiral emitter during triplet sensitization, maximizing the magnetic dipole moment.








Abstract
The potential of chiral organic molecules exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) for practical applications hinges on the luminescence efficiency and dissymmetry factor (glum). However, surpassing the molecular limitations of dissymmetry factors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the different parity selection rules governing the electric and magnetic dipole moments in chiral molecules. In this study, we tackle this inherent constraint by designing a triplet sensitization photon upconversion system using nontoxic CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) photosensitizer. We demonstrate a 43&#8208;fold amplification of CPL in QD&#8208;sensitized triplet fusion process compared to the direct photoexcitation. Notably, a high green&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion quantum efficiency of 12.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.19% (normalized to 100%) was achieved. The dissymmetry factors of QD&#8208;sensitized upconversion CPL outperform previous reports based on molecular photosensitizers. The observed large glum, according to our modeling and first&#8208;principles calculations, originates from the unique structural rearrangement of the chiral emitter during the ultrafast triplet energy transfer process. Our work provides a new strategy and mechanistic insights for CPL amplification through triplet sensitization.

         <title>Interrupting the Hydroxide Enrichment&#8208;Induced Electrode Degradation Loop for Achieving Stable Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper utilizes an electrolyte additive to dynamically interrupt the OH&#8722; crossover&#8208;induced electrode degradation and polyiodide formation. Moreover, it builds water&#8208;deficient electric double layers (EDLs) and forms a ZnS&#8208;rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), constrains OH&#8722;, and captures polyiodides at the cathode to simultaneously boost the aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery.








Abstract
Severe adverse reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polyiodide shuttle, lead to short lifetimes of rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries and have aroused widespread attention. However, few studies have specifically investigated the impact of hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) disturbance generated by side reactions on the Zn anode and I2 cathode in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a facile electrolyte additive strategy was introduced to break the OH&#8722; enrichment&#8208;induced bidirectional electrode degradation loop toward achieving stable Zn&#8208;I2 cells. Particularly, the bidirectional additive restricts the crossover of OH&#8722;, suppressing the iodine hydrolysis reaction&#8208;induced polyiodide formation and capturing polyiodides to prevent shuttling. It also preferentially interacts with Zn, simultaneously reconstructing the solvation shell and promoting the formation of a hybrid ZnS&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to improve Zn kinetics and inhibit HER. Therefore, a stable cycling of Zn//Zn cells can be sustained for 1700 and 400 h in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Impressively, the Zn&#8208;I2 cell achieved a cycle life of 9000 cycles at a high mass loading of 12 mg cm&#8722;2. The concept of bi&#8208;directional synergetic regulation for accounting for the aqueous environment is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

However, few studies have specifically investigated the impact of hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) disturbance generated by side reactions on the Zn anode and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a facile electrolyte additive strategy was introduced to break the OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; enrichment-induced bidirectional electrode degradation loop toward achieving stable Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells. Particularly, the bidirectional additive restricts the crossover of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, suppressing the iodine hydrolysis reaction-induced polyiodide formation and capturing polyiodides to prevent shuttling. It also preferentially interacts with Zn, simultaneously reconstructing the solvation shell and promoting the formation of a hybrid ZnS-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to improve Zn kinetics and inhibit HER. Therefore, a stable cycling of Zn//Zn cells can be sustained for 1700 and 400 h in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Impressively, the Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell achieved a cycle life of 9000 cycles at a high mass loading of 12 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The concept of bi-directional synergetic regulation for accounting for the aqueous environment is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable aqueous Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrophobic Polymer Zwitterions: Impacts of Silylsilane Substitution on Solution and Interfacial Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a new class of zwitterion is described, specifically silylsilane&#8208;substituted sulfobetaine (SB) methacrylate monomers and polymers. The resultant hydrophobic polymer zwitterions (HPZs) exhibited exceptionally unusual solubility unusual relative to conventional zwitterionic polymers, owing to the dominance of the hydrophobic moieties on solution properties. The unique HPZ structure was found to translate to unusual surface and solution properties, including water&#8208;adhesive coatings and high aspect ratio structures in solution.








Abstract
A new class of zwitterionic polymer amphiphiles was prepared by synthesis and polymerization of novel silyl&#8208;substituted sulfobetaine (SB) methacrylate monomers. These silyl&#8208;SB methacrylates proved amenable to controlled free radical polymerization methods to afford hydrophobic polymer zwitterions (HPZs) with solubility properties not observed previously for polymer zwitterions (PZs) owing to the dominance of the alkylsilyl groups on solution behavior and surface properties. For example, the solubility profile of HPZs does not overlap with most conventional PZs&#8212;they are insoluble in aqueous solutions or trifluoroethanol and instead are soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran. Interestingly, HPZs exhibited an apparent propensity to form structures in which the zwitterionic components are shielded from the surrounding organic solvent in favor of displaying the alkylsilyl groups. In THF, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) results are characteristic of high aspect ratio (rod&#8208; or cylinder&#8208;like) structures. Moreover, as thin films HPZs imparted a marked effect on surface properties relative to typical zwitterionic coatings, where the dynamic interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties pins water to the surface. This affords surfaces that are simultaneously hydrophobic and water&#8208;adhesive, offering an alternative to the types of fluorocarbon&#8208;based structures under scrutiny as perfluoroalkyl substances (i.e., PFAS).

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Quaternary Ammonium Binding Motifs on Metal Nanoparticles Enable Selective Ion Transport for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic polymer ligands with positively charged head groups show a profound impact on the transport of ions and water at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface. Under negative bias, bicarbonates as counterions are preconcentrated, while extended hydrophobic polymers modulate the hydrogen bonding network among water. 








Abstract
We report a new class of hydrophobic polymer ligands with quaternary ammonium head groups for surface modification of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). Quaternary ammonium ligands bind NPs through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions, producing polymer&#8208;grafted NPs with high colloidal and chemical stability. These polymers having charged head groups offer powerful strategies to tailor the structure and function of metal&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in electrocatalytic systems. The ammonium head groups serve as ionic reservoirs that preconcentrate bicarbonate counterions at the surface of nanocatalysts, while the hydrophobic polymer backbones restructure local hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, modulating water and ion transport dynamics. These interfacial effects promote CO2 electroreduction, particularly under diffusion&#8208;limited conditions, resulting in a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90%.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes on a III&#8208;V Semiconductor: From Chain Formation to Ordered Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of GaAs, a model III&#8208;V semiconductor, with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes is demonstrated in a multidisciplinary experimental and theoretical approach. In this way, ordered monolayers consisting of chains of molecules binding covalently to the surface are obtained, which are found to strongly modify the surface properties as evident from large work function reductions.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are established ligands for various surfaces, known for their strong binding, ability to form self&#8208;assembled monolayers, and modular structure. However, semiconductor surface modification with NHCs is still in its infancy despite its technological importance. Although previous studies focused on silicon, III&#8208;V compound semiconductors offer direct bandgaps and high electron mobilities, making them ideal for (opto&#8208;)electronics. This study examines the adsorption of different NHCs on GaAs, a prototypical III&#8208;V material, using scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low&#8208;energy electron diffraction, and reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy. Covalent binding to the surface and the formation of well&#8208;ordered NHC monolayers are observed, along with exceptionally large work function reductions. The unique structural features of NHCs enable precise control over film structure, ordering, and electronic properties.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Borylation of &#945;&#8208;Benzoyl Alkyl Bromides by Zinc Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zinc&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioconvergent borylation of alkyl halides has been developed. The radical reaction mechanism was elucidated through a combination of experiments and DFT calculations. This method represents the first instance of a zinc catalyst being employed for the enantioconvergent borylation of alkyl halides, exhibiting remarkable substrate compatibility. The chiral &#945;&#8208;boryl benzoates demonstrate considerable potential in synthesis, providing pathways and options for the synthesis and transformation of chiral compounds.








Abstract
The direct synthesis of chiral compounds from racemic alkyl halides is highly valued in organic synthesis. In this study, we present the first zinc&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent transformation of alkyl halides, which is enabled by substrate design and commercial diamine ligands. Chiral C&#9472;B bonds with dual transformable groups were successfully synthesized with high yield and enantioselectivity. This method also facilitates the construction of two convertible functional groups on the same carbon atom, thereby converting them into diverse chiral functional groups. Mechanistic study reveals that the Zn(II)&#8208;Bpin complex serves as the critical species for radical initiation, while the interaction between the ester group of the substrate and the catalyst is crucial in determining chirality. Notably, Zn(II) maintains its oxidation state throughout the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Bicyclic Isosteres of Pyridine/Piperidine: From Synthesis to Applications</title>

2&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes have been designed, synthesized, and validated biologically as isosteres of piperidine/pyridine. The cyclization of cyclic alkenyl amines was performed with the KOtBu/I2/CO2. This method proved to be general&#8212;it was also used to prepare other azabicycles.

Abstract
2&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes have been designed, synthesized, and validated biologically as isosteres of piperidine/pyridine. The key reaction step was the cyclization of cyclic alkenyl amines with the KOtBu/I2/CO2 combination. The method proved to be scalable (up to 20&#160;g) and general: it was also applied for the synthesis of 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, 7&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, and 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes. Finally, combined with the nitrogen deletion tactic, this method also opened a practical way toward the previously hardly accessible 1,2&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes&#8212;saturated analogues of ortho&#8208;benzenes.

The key reaction step was the cyclization of cyclic alkenyl amines with the KO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu/I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combination. The method proved to be scalable (up to 20&#160;g) and general: it was also applied for the synthesis of 2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, 2-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, and 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes. Finally, combined with the nitrogen deletion tactic, this method also opened a practical way toward the previously hardly accessible 1,2-disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes&#8212;saturated analogues of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-benzenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorophenyl and Trifluoromethylphenyl Terminal Groups: Enabling BT.2020&#8208;Targeted Narrowband Green Emission in High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically fusing diboron&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks with dibenzo[b,d]furan units and introducing fluorine&#8208;containing units as terminal substituents, highly efficient narrowband pure green&#8208;emitting multiple resonance&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials can be developed, with precisely controlled emission peaks while maintaining a narrow full width at half maximum.








Abstract
To meet the critical demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) display technology, luminescent materials must achieve precise peak emission positions and narrow emission bandwidths simultaneously. Herein, we report a new class of narrowband pure green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, DBNDO&#8208;1, DBNDO&#8208;2, and DBNDO&#8208;3. These compounds are constructed on diborane&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) skeletons fused with a dibenzo[b,d]furan motif. Through strategic incorporation of three distinct terminal substituents, 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl units, we further precisely modulate emission maxima while maintaining narrowband emission characteristics. All of these emitters exhibit bright green luminescence and narrowband emission characteristics, with luminescence peaks ranging from 513 to 518&#160;nm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is only 14 to 16&#160;nm in dilute toluene solution. Additionally, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for all of these emitters exceed 95%. The corresponding optimized OLEDs based on DBNDO&#8208;1, DBNDO&#8208;2, and DBNDO&#8208;3 achieved peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 33.7%, 32.4%, and 32.0%, respectively. The CIEy coordinates for these OLEDs were 0.74, 0.75, and 0.75, with FWHM values ranging from 18.5 to 19.4&#160;nm. To the best of my knowledge, the EQEs, FWHM, and CIEy values represent some of the most exceptional performance metrics reported in the current literature.

         <title>Unlocking DAST&#8208;Type Reagents for Modular Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have unlocked commercial DAST&#8208;type reagents as versatile sulfur precursors for the modular synthesis of multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted S(IV)/S(VI) centers, expanding their utility beyond classical fluorination. This practical strategy, operating under ambient and mild conditions, enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A highly reactive S(IV)&#8211;F species is identified as the key intermediate. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted sulfur centers are increasingly significant in drug discovery, yet their modular synthesis remains challenging. Current strategies employing sulfinylamines, sulfurdiimides, or SOF4 suffer from inherent limitations. To address this, a general and practical strategy for constructing diverse sulfur centers bearing multiple oxygen or nitrogen substituents is urgently needed. Herein, we report a modular synthesis of such motifs using commercially available DAST&#8208;type reagents as underexplored sulfur precursors. This methodology expands the utility of classical fluorination agents as sulfur sources, operates under ambient and mild conditions, and enables rapid access to diverse S(IV) and S(VI) architectures through sequential substitution and further flexible transformations. The practicality of this approach is highlighted by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies support the proposed highly reactive S(IV)&#8208;F intermediate.

         <title>Converting Residual Unstable PbI2 into Robust 2D Perovskite via Spacer Cation Engineering Toward Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective management strategy of residual photoactive PbI2 based on dimensional engineering is developed, which stabilizes grain boundaries and thus improves device operational stability. The p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted devices incorporating guanfacine hydrochloride (GUFCl) fulfill a champion efficiency of 26.19%, maintaining 92% of their initial efficiency after 1100&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation.








Abstract
Addressing light instability challenges induced by residual PbI2 is essential for simultaneously achieving high power conversion efficiency and excellent stability. Herein, we report an effective management strategy of residual photoactive PbI2 based on dimensional engineering. The guanfacine hydrochloride (GUFCl) as additive or interface modifier is used to modulate perovskite films, converting residual PbI2 at grain boundaries (GBs) into stable 2D perovskites, which suppresses the photodecomposition of perovskite films, inhibits ion migration and thus stabilizes GBs. The formation of 2D perovskites can result in reduced defect density and facilitated carrier transport and extraction, thereby mitigating carrier nonradiative recombination. As a result, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating GUFCl achieve a champion efficiency of 26.19% with significantly improved operational stability. The unencapsulated inverted PSC maintains 92% of its initial efficiency after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point (MPP) continuous tracking. This work provides a simple yet effective method to solve the residual PbI2&#8208;induced intrinsic instability issue, aiming to realize efficient, operationally stable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Toward Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries: Engineering Metal Utilization from Excess to Zero</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving metal utilization and increasing the depth of discharge in sodium metal batteries (SMBs) offer a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective energy storage. This Review highlights recent advances in limited&#8208;metal and anode&#8208;free SMBs, including electrode architecture, electrolyte formulation, interfacial engineering, and cathode optimization, aiming to mitigate sodium loss and enhance cycling stability.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with limited metal content or anode&#8209;free configurations hold significant potential to mitigate safety risks associated with active sodium (Na) metal, while delivering high energy density and reducing environmental impact. Nevertheless, the absence of a sustained Na supply readily leads to rapid battery performance degradation due to the irreversible consumption of Na source during repeated charge/discharge cycles. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and detailed review on enhancing metal utilization in SMBs, particularly addressing failure mechanisms and strategies to extend battery lifespan. This review provides in&#8208;depth discussions on the relationship between metal utilization and the depth of discharge, and the bridge transitioning from uncontrolled sodium content to anode&#8208;free configuration. Based on this, the proposed review will focus on the variations in metal utilization, elucidating the distinct characteristics and design strategies of sodium metal batteries with varying metal content scenarios (limited metal content and anode&#8209;free configurations). This review will systematically overview their configuration, working mechanisms, inherent advantages, and associated challenges. It will also highlight the latest advancements in performance enhancement and conclude with a brief discussion on the future research directions for SMBs.

         <title>Interactional Features of (RO)4Ti Species and Their Zr and Hf Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational and experimental studies reveal that Group 4 tetroxides form a new type of &#963;&#8208;hole interaction with N and O nucleophiles, which we propose to name &#8220;titan bonds&#8221; (TnBs). These insights into Ti, Zr, and Hf interactions may aid in the rational design of more selective catalysts for aldol and oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Tetroxides of Group 4 elements are benchmark catalysts for aldol reactions and oxidation processes, achieving high yields and regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Our computational analyses and experimental studies, performed in solution and solid, consistently reveal that these tetroxides form attractive interactions with lone pair compounds exhibiting distinctive &#963;&#8208;hole bond features. We propose naming these novel bondings as titan bonds (TnBs). These new insights into Ti/Zr/Hf tetroxide interactions may significantly aid in designing more effective catalysts with enhanced selectivities.

&lt;p&gt;Computational and experimental studies reveal that Group 4 tetroxides form a new type of &#963;-hole interaction with N and O nucleophiles, which we propose to name &#8220;titan bonds&#8221; (TnBs). These insights into Ti, Zr, and Hf interactions may aid in the rational design of more selective catalysts for aldol and oxidation reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetroxides of Group 4 elements are benchmark catalysts for aldol reactions and oxidation processes, achieving high yields and regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities. Our computational analyses and experimental studies, performed in solution and solid, consistently reveal that these tetroxides form attractive interactions with lone pair compounds exhibiting distinctive &#963;-hole bond features. We propose naming these novel bondings as titan bonds (TnBs). These new insights into Ti/Zr/Hf tetroxide interactions may significantly aid in designing more effective catalysts with enhanced selectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybridized Multi&#8208;Spiral Donor Engineering for High&#8208;Efficiency Narrowband Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;spiral donor engineering unlocks narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with external quantum efficiency of 39.1% and full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 25&#160;nm. Orthogonal spiral donors suppress aggregation while boosting efficiency&#8212;a leap toward high&#8208;performance OLEDs.








Abstract
The pursuit of narrowband multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a critical challenge in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). A novel molecular design paradigm is proposed by hybridizing di&#8208;/tri&#8208;spiral donors in polycyclic heteroaromatic frameworks. The orthogonal, sterically hindered spiral donors disrupt molecular planarity, which can simultaneously suppress the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and spectral broadening. These emitters exhibit narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 22&#8211;24&#160;nm and high photoluminescence quantum yields of &#8764;100%. The tri&#8208;spiral donor configuration further improves horizontal dipole orientation for the enhanced light outcoupling. As a result, the optimal Ts&#8208;NBN&#8208;based OLED achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1% with the CIE y value of 0.70.

         <title>Redox Noninnocence of a &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Enabling Electron Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox noninnocence of a &#946;&#8208;diketiminate backbone has been evaluated for indole alkoxycarboxylation reactions, where the electron&#8208;rich ligand backbone steers the electron transfer reactions.








Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;diketiminate is an iconic class of ligand that spans a wide variety of metal complexes across the periodic table. Compared to the well&#8208;evaluated redox noninnocent nature of several other ligand classes, detectable redox activity for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate is scarce. The development of an effective homogeneous catalyst leveraging the redox reservoir property of a &#946;&#8208;diketiminate backbone has never been achieved. Herein, we present a copper bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) complex that enables the completely ligand&#8208;centric redox for steering alkoxycarboxylation at the 2&#8208;position of indole. The success of the reaction pivots on the electron reservoir property of an electron&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;diketiminate that can facilitate single electron transfer to reductively cleave a C&#9472;Br bond. X&#8208;ray structure determination of the complex, along with CV, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility, describes the electronic structure of the catalyst molecule and proves the ligand's predominant role in such single&#8208;electron transfer catalysis.

         <title>Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Multiplexed Health Surveillance Panel Using Ultra High&#8208;Throughput PRM&#8208;MS in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Validating biomarkers of disease is necessary for clinical use. The Health Surveillance Panel (83 peptides from 57 proteins) was developed as a PRM assay and evaluated using the Stellar&#8208;MS platform. The assay was validated with a large clinical cohort of inflammatory bowel disease patients alongside quality controls. Analysis demonstrates strong performance, disease insight, and a preferred approach for future high&#8208;throughput biomarker validation.








Abstract
Despite advances in clinical proteomics, translating protein biomarker discoveries into clinical use remains challenging due to the technical complexity of the validation process. Targeted MS&#8208;based proteomic approaches such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) offer sensitive and specific assays for biomarker translation. In this study, we developed a multiplex PRM assay using the Stellar mass spectrometry platform to quantify 57 plasma proteins, including 24 FDA&#8208;approved biomarkers. Loading curves (11 points) were performed at 4 sample throughputs (100, 144, 180, and 300 samples per day) using independently optimized and scheduled PRM methods. Following optimization, an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort of plasma samples (493 IBD, 509 matched controls) was analyzed at a throughput of 180 samples per day. To monitor system performance, the study also included over 1000 additional injections for system suitability tests, low&#8208;, middle&#8208;, and high&#8208;quality controls, washes, and blanks. Using this approach, we observed high quantifiability (linearity, sensitivity, and reproducibility) in the PRM assay and consistent data acquisition across a large cohort. We also validated the candidate IBD markers, C&#8208;reactive protein and orosomucoid protein, identified in a recent discovery experiment.

         <title>Toward Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Metathesis: Mapping the Reactivity and Deactivation Pathways of an Iron Metallacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis has long remained elusive. This study identifies &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination from an iron metallacyclobutane as a key deactivation pathway in iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis, through combined computational and experimental efforts. By elucidating spin&#8208;state, ligand, and steric effects novel reactivity descriptors are identified, that aid in designing next&#8208;generation iron&#8208;based metathesis catalysts.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis holds great promise as a sustainable alternative to its precious metal congeners, yet its development has been hindered by poor mechanistic understanding and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here, we report the combined computational and experimental identification of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination as a key decomposition pathway from an iron metallacyclobutane, an essential intermediate in metathesis catalysis. Using our previously reported PCNHCP&#8208;ligated iron(0) complex [(PCNHCP)Fe(N2)2], we observe under metathesis conditions the formation of an iron(II) allyl hydride product, consistent with our computational predictions of a low&#8208;energy &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination pathway. Detailed spin&#8208;state&#8208;resolved DFT analysis reveals that while metallacyclobutane formation is feasible across multiple spin surfaces, subsequent reactivity is strongly governed by the singlet state. Coordination of N2 is shown to inhibit metathesis and promote decomposition by raising the transition&#8208;state barrier for cycloreversion while facilitating &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Subsequent calculations show that upon suppressing this decomposition channel productive metathesis is restored. These findings offer mechanistically grounded design principles for next&#8208;generation iron&#8208;based metathesis catalysts and highlight the importance of spin&#8208;state control, ligand environment, and substrate selection in overcoming catalyst deactivation and provide a foray into productive iron catalyzed alkene metathesis.

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous photoelectrodes are widespread for activations of H2O and CO2, while homogeneous photoelectrochemistry with molecular catalysts dominates complex molecule activations in synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great potential for synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review comprehensively presents the field in a manner accessible to synthetic chemists, including surface techniques for photoelectrode fabrication.








Abstract
Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets, and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous photoelectrodes are widespread for activations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while homogeneous photoelectrochemistry with molecular catalysts dominates complex molecule activations in synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great potential for synthesis, including catalyst cost-efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review comprehensively presents the field in a manner accessible to synthetic chemists, including surface techniques for photoelectrode fabrication.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost-efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro-activated) photocatalysts to dye-sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets, and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Probes Reveal the Rules of Intracellular Ether Lipid Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article introduces the first bifunctional ether lipids that were used for comparative studies of ester and ether lipid transport in mammalian cells. We find differential recognition of alkyl ether and vinyl ether lipids (plasmalogens) by lipid transfer proteins indicating distinct functional roles within cells. The new probes will advance the understanding of ether lipid biology in mechanistic detail.








Abstract
Ether&#160;glycerophospholipids bear a&#160;long chain alcohol attached via&#160;an&#160;alkyl or vinyl&#160;ether bond at the sn1 position&#160;of the glycerol backbone.&#160;Ether lipids&#160;play&#160;a significant role in&#160;physiology&#160;and human health.&#160;However, their cellular functions remain largely unknown due to a lack of tools for identifying their subcellular localization and interacting proteins. Here, we address this methodological gap by synthesizing minimally modified bifunctional ether lipid probes by introducing&#160;diazirine and alkyne groups.&#160;To interrogate the subcellular kinetics of intracellular ether lipid transport in mammalian cells, we used a combination of fluorescence imaging, machine learning&#8208;assisted image analysis, and mathematical modelling. We find that&#160;alkyl&#8208;linked&#160;ether&#160;lipids are transported up to twofold faster than vinyl&#8208;linked species (plasmalogens), pointing to yet undiscovered cellular lipid transport machinery able to&#160;distinguish between linkage types differing by as little as two hydrogen atoms. We find that ether lipid transport predominantly occurs via non&#8208;vesicular pathways, with varying contributions from vesicular mechanisms between cell types. Altogether, our results suggest that differential recognition of alkyl&#8208; and vinyl ether lipids by lipid transfer proteins contributes to their distinct biological functions. In&#160;the future, the probes reported here will enable studying ether lipid biology in much greater detail through identification of interacting proteins and in&#8208;depth characterization of intracellular ether lipid dynamics.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Locking Strategy Enables Volatile Ether Organic Electrolytes to Achieve High&#8208;Energy Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;locking subnanometer&#8208;nanowire gel electrolytes (SNWGE) enable high&#8208;energy Li cells from ether solutions. Three&#8208;dimensional network traps nonpolar solvent and promotes salt dissociation, yielding high ionic conductivity, wide potential window, and robust interfaces. Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells retain 88.5% (670th) and Li&#8211;air cells operate&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles. At 28.5% of commercial carbonate electrolyte cost, SNWGE offers a scalable, durable, and intrinsically safer electrolyte platform.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal batteries are constrained by safety and lifespan owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. Here, we report a synergy of molecular&#8208;locking and gelation treatment by cations&#8211;bridged polyoxometalate subnanometer nanowires (SNW), which facilitates using ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;energy Li metal batteries. The formed SNW&#8208;based gel electrolyte (SNWGE) exhibits continuous three&#8208;dimensional networks that effectively capture nonpolar ether electrolytes and promote the dissociation of Li salts, eliminating the risks of electrolyte leakage and volatilization. Homogeneous and continuous Li+ fast transport channels were created in the SNWGE through intermolecular interactions, contributing to sufficient ionic conductivity (1.26 mS cm&#8722;1), high oxidative stability (up to 5.0&#160;V versus Li+/Li), and good solid/cathode electrolyte interphase formation capability. The SNWGE enables the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells to reach good cyclability (over 88% capacity retention after 670 cycles), excellent low&#8208;temperature, and abuse&#8208;tolerant properties. Notably, the cost of the SNWGE is only 28.5% of the commercial electrolyte (1&#160;M lithium hexafluorophosphate in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate), highlighting its significant potential for industrial application. When the SNWGE is tested in Li&#8211;air batteries, a stable cycling of&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles was obtained. The electrolyte design paves a promising path for highly energetic, durable, and safe rechargeable Li metal batteries.

         <title>Programmable Bio&#8208;Derived Noncovalent Glass via Reconfigurable H&#8208;Bonding Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a programmable glass via reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks between natural biomolecules and organic acids, redefining glass as an active material medium with encoded structural logic. The strategy expands the frontiers of glass chemistry toward sustainable electronics, transient architectures, and environmentally adaptive materials.








Abstract
Glass has served as a cornerstone of modern civilization due to its exceptional optical transparency and structural integrity. Yet, its static covalent/ionic network fundamentally restricts environmental adaptability, presenting a critical challenge for next&#8208;generation sustainable technologies. Here, we report a programmable, bio&#8208;derived noncovalent glass (BNG) engineered through multivalent, reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks composed of natural building blocks (e.g., amino acids, peptides, biomacromolecules) and organic acids with multiple H&#8208;bond donors and acceptors. Molecular programming of these networks enables unprecedented four&#8208;dimensional control: hydration&#8208;tunable mechanical stiffness, amino acid&#8208;guided refractive index modulation, humidity/temperature&#8208;activated self&#8208;healing, and closed&#8208;loop aqueous recyclability. This molecularly encoded programmability distinguishes BNG from conventional smart materials, which typically rely on single stimulus&#8211;response modes. Critically, the configurability of H&#8208;bonding network further endows BNG with versatile processability (e.g., 3D printing, thermal pressing, and mold&#8208;casting) for functional architectures. Moreover, the programmable disassembly allows seamless integration into transient electronics as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to energy&#8208;intensive glass recycling. By leveraging naturally abundant, metabolically benign building blocks, BNG establishes a sustainable paradigm for adaptive soft electronics and circular packaging&#8212;transforming glass from a passive structural medium to a dynamically programmable material.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Resistant N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked TEMPO Catholytes for Long&#8208;Lasting Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of proton&#8208;resistant TEMPO catholytes were developed via N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and heterocycle grafting, enabling efficient charge redistribution and exceptional redox stability. The optimized DMA&#8208;TEMPO derivative delivers near&#8208;quantitative capacity retention (99.98% over 560 cycles), offering a robust molecular design strategy for durable AORFBs.








Abstract
TEMPO is a widely studied catholyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) but suffers from proton&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening degradation when its solubility is enhanced via hydrophilic substitution at the 4&#8208;position, leading to structural failure and rapid capacity fade. To address this issue, five TEMPO derivatives were synthesized through N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycle grafting strategy. Combined analyses using atomic dipole moment&#8208;corrected Hirshfeld (ADCH) charges, Fukui functions, and linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LTQ&#8208;XL) reveal that aromatic heterocycle functionalization enables favorable charge redistribution during redox cycling, enhancing both redox kinetics and molecular stability. In particular, dimethylaminopyridine&#8208;functionalized TEMPO (DMA&#8208;TEMPO) exhibits enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation and basicity, which suppresses proton&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening and significantly improves structural resilience. 1&#160;M DMA&#8208;TEMPO catholyte delivers exceptional cycling performance, retaining 99.98% of its capacity after 560 cycles, while 2&#160;M system maintains 97% capacity over 100 cycles. Compared to its structural analog 1&#160;M PA&#8208;TEMPO, the cycle life is improved 18&#8208;fold. This study offers a robust molecular design strategy for developing proton&#8208;resistant catholytes, advancing the practical deployment of long&#8208;lasting AORFBs for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Allyl Radicals and Heterocoupled Dimer: Synthesis, Characterization, and Near&#8208;Infrared Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein three emissive allyl radicals via conjugated extension of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide and 1,3,5&#8208;trichlorobenzene protection. p&#8208;Tolyl and triphenylamine substitutions successfully produce stable allyl monoradicals, ARS&#8208;Ph and ARS&#8208;TPA, respectively. Whereas chlorine substituent affords an unexpected heterocoupled diradicaloid ARS&#8208;HD. Notably, ARS&#8208;TPA exhibits NIR fluorescent emission at 860 nm.








Abstract
Air&#8208;stable luminescent monoradical remains rare. Herein, we report novel stable allyl radicals (ARS) achieved by conjugated extension of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide and steric protection of 1,3,5&#8208;trichlorobenzene. The reactivity and photophysical properties of these allyl radicals are strongly dependent on protecting groups. Introducing p&#8208;tolyl group or triphenylamine afforded air&#8208;stable monoradical ARS&#8208;Ph and ARS&#8208;TPA, respectively. ARS&#8208;Ph displays doublet luminescence at 752&#160;nm with negligible photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY). ARS&#8208;TPA exhibits NIR fluorescence at 860&#160;nm with a PLQY of 11.7%. Whereas, chlorine&#8208;protected ARS&#8208;Cl proved inaccessible, an unsymmetric heterocoupled dimer ARS&#8208;HD was isolated as a luminescent singlet diradicaloid with emission at 790&#160;nm and a PLQY of 0.8%. Natural transition orbital analysis reveals the local excitation nature of ARS&#8208;Ph, excited charge&#8208;transfer characteristics of ARS&#8208;TPA and ARS&#8208;HD. Huang&#8208;Rhys factor and reorganization energy analyses of ARS&#8208;TPA disclose the critical effects of the vibrational decoupling and structure rigidity for its enhanced emission intensity and spectral sharpness. Remarkably, under continuous 365&#160;nm light, ARS&#8208;Ph, ARS&#8208;TPA, and ARS&#8208;HD exhibit excellent luminescent photostability in ambient conditions with half&#8208;lives of 19.7, 42.6, and 21.4 h, respectively. Our study presents a straightforward strategy for developing air&#8208;stable luminescent allyl radicals, expanding the family of luminescent radical materials.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2 Nm Palladium Phosphide: A Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine palladium phosphide (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimension is synthesized controllably via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy not only enhances the Pd atom utilization but also improves its catalytic performance. The sub&#8208;2&#160;nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol








Abstract
Phosphidation offers a promising approach to tailor noble metal properties for high catalytic selectivity, yet achieving highly dispersed noble metal phosphides with efficient atom utilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimensions via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defect&#8208;rich TiO2&#8208;supported Pd (Pd/d&#8208;TiO2) as the phosphidation precursor. The strong anchoring effect of d&#8208;TiO2 defects effectively mitigates the aggregation of PdxPy during phosphidation, yielding uniformly dispersed PdxPy nanoparticles with an average size of 1.68&#160;nm. The resulting PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 exhibits exceptional performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 97.5% selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 833.8 h&#8722;1. This significantly outperforms the unphosphated Pd/d&#8208;TiO2 (54.7% selectivity and TOF of 220.6 h&#8722;1) and large&#8208;sized PdxPy (5.18&#160;nm) on pristine TiO2 (95.3% selectivity and TOF of 347.4 h&#8722;1). The enhanced performance of PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 is attributed to the high Pd atom utilization and phosphidation&#8208;induced generation of isolated Pd sites that minimize the side reactions by modulating furfural adsorption and spillover H2 formation. Our findings provide a novel and effective approach for the controllable synthesis of ultrafine noble metal phosphides by leveraging the defect&#8208;anchoring effect, advancing both atomic economy and selective hydrogenation catalysis.

         <title>Control of Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Reactivity by Rotaxanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been achieved by rotaxanation. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield and they displayed a much slower kinetics compared to the corresponding thread. Mechanical bond disassembly upon the right stimulus activates reactivity. Indeed, IEDDA could be selectively activated inside senescent surrogate cells by a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;responsive rotaxane.








Abstract
Rotaxanation is an efficient method to control the tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield by crown ether active template applied to the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines. Kinetics of the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazine rotaxanes were much slower than those with the corresponding threads. Interestingly, disassembly of the mechanical bond upon the application of the right stimulus activates IEDDA. Control of IEDDA in live cells was proved by means of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase sensitive tetrazine rotaxane: Enzymatic digestion allowed the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, which resulted in a fluorescent compound.

         <title>Solvent Channels and Electric Fields Guide Proton Delivery to the Active Site of Heme Peroxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic potential surfaces and electric field lines reveal that local fields guide proton delivery through multiple conserved solvent channels in heme peroxidases, enabling efficient access to the active site.








Abstract
The active sites of heme enzymes have evolved to control the formation of highly reactive intermediates in oxidative catalysis. Proton delivery to the heme is essential, yet the mechanisms of proton delivery remain poorly understood. Here, we identify routes and drivers of proton delivery in a heme peroxidase (ascorbate peroxidase) using computational approaches that combine classical, quantum, and hybrid methods with enhanced sampling and local electric field (LEF) analyses. Our results show that networks of active&#8208;site water molecules facilitate proton exchange with Arg38, which may act as a transient proton carrier at the &#947;&#8208;heme edge where the substrate binds. The distal His42 residue aids proton transfer into the active site via solvent at the &#948;&#8208;edge. Molecular dynamics simulations of three heme peroxidases identify hydrated channels leading to both &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, allowing solvent protons to reach the active site. Comparison with eight other heme peroxidases shows that these channels are conserved. LEF analyses reveal a continuous electrostatic funnel drawing protons toward the heme from the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, a feature that is broadly conserved across other peroxidases. These results suggest that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery in peroxidase catalysis.
