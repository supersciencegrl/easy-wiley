         <title>Integrating&#160;Host Design and Tailored&#160;Electronic Effects of Yolk&#8208;Shell Zn&#8208;Mn Diatomic&#160;Sites for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the surface and spatial structure of the host is associated with the reactivity of the active site, and also enhances the mass transfer effect of the CO2 electroreduction process (CO2RR). Here, we develop two&#8208;step ligand etch&#8208;pyrolysis to access an asymmetric dual atomic&#8208;site catalyst&#160;(DASC) composed of S,&#160;N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8208;Mn dimer anchored on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) derived yolk&#8208;shell carbon framework (Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC), with high accessibility. In Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC,&#160;the electronic effects of S/N&#8208;Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;S/N configuration are tailored by strong interactions between Zn&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;sites and co&#8208;coordinating with S/N atoms, rendering structural stability and atomic distribution. In H&#8208;cell, the Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC DASC shows low onset overpotential of 50 mV and high CO Faraday efficiency of 97% with low applied overpotential of 343 mV, which outperforms the properties of counterparts, and in flow&#8208;cell, it also reaches high current density of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.85 V benefit by the high structure accessibility and active dual&#8208;site. Density functional theory&#160;simulations interpret that the S, N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8208;Mn diatomic site with optimal adsorption strength of COOH* lowers the reaction energy barrier, thus&#160;boosting the intrinsic CO2RR activity on DASC. This work illustrates the structure&#8208;property correlation, giving new ideas to the development of highly accessible atomic catalysts for facilitating practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ru Symmetry of a RuO2&#160;Catalyst for Sustainable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a highly promising hydrogen production technique for sustainable energy supply, however, achieving a highly active and durable catalyst for acidic water oxidation still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a local microenvironment regulation strategy for precisely tuning In&#8208;RuO2/graphene (In&#8208;RuO2/G) catalyst with remarkably intrinsic electrochemical activity and stability to boost acidic water oxidation. The In&#8208;RuO2/G displays robust acid oxygen evolution reaction performance with a mass activity of 671 A gcat&#8722;1 at 1.5 V, an overpotential of 187 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;lasting stability of 350 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, which arises from the asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;In local structure interactions. Further, it is unraveled theoretically that the asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;In structure breaks the thermodynamic activity limit of the traditional adsorption evolution mechanism which significantly weakens the formation energy barrier of OOH*, thus inducing a new rate&#8208;determining step of *OH absorption. Therefore, this strategy showcases the immense potential for constructing high&#8208;performance acidic catalysts for water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;promoted Iron&#8208;catalyzed Nitrene Transfer for the Synthesis of Hydrazines and Triazanes through N&#8208;Amidation of Arylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer has emerged as an attractive strategy for constructing N&#8722;C and N&#8722;heteroatom bonds. However, the ligand control in these Fe&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions remains underdeveloped. Our previous studies discovered that 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones could react with various arylamines or phosphines to give N&#8722;N or N&#8722;P coupled products respectively under simple FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed conditions. Herein, we report that bulky alkylphosphines such as PtBu3 can switch the roles from actor&#160;to spectator&#160;ligands to promote the FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;amidation reaction of arylamines with dioxazolones, giving hydrazides in high efficiency and chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that the phosphine ligands could facilitate the decarboxylation of dioxazolones on the Fe center, and the hydrogen bonding interactions between the arylamines and the ligands on Fe nitrenoid intermediates might play a role in modulating the delicate interplay between the phosphine ligand, arylamine, and acyl nitrene N, favoring N&#8722;N coupling over N&#8722;P coupling. The new ligand&#8208;promoted N&#8208;amidation protocols offer a convenient way to access various challenging triazane compounds via double or sequential N&#8208;amidation of primary arylamines.</dc:description>

         <title>Slowly Removing Surface Ligand by Aging Enhances the Stability of Pd Nanosheets toward Electron Beam Irradiation and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective method to remove the surface ligand from Pd nanosheets by simply aging the sample in ethanol at room temperature. This slow process allows for atomic reconstruction without altering the sheet morphology. When exposed to e&#8208;beam irradiation or working as an electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation, the aged Pd nanosheets show enhanced stability.







Abstract
Surface ligands play an important role in shape&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization of colloidal nanocrystals. Their quick removal tends to cause structural deformation and/or aggregation to the nanocrystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface ligand based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can be slowly removed from Pd nanosheets (NSs, 0.93&#177;0.17&#8197;nm in thickness) by simply aging the colloidal suspension. The aged Pd NSs show well&#8208;preserved morphology, together with significantly enhanced stability toward both e&#8208;beam irradiation and electrocatalysis (e.g., ethanol oxidation). It is revealed that the slow desorption of PVP during aging forces the re&#8208;exposed Pd atoms to reorganize, facilitating the surface to transform from being nearly perfect to defect&#8208;rich. The resultant Pd NSs with abundant defects no longer rely on surface ligand to stabilize the atomic arrangement and thus show excellent structural and electrochemical stability. This work provides a facile and effective method to maintain the integrity of colloidal nanocrystals by slowly removing the surface ligand.

&lt;p&gt;We report an effective method to remove the surface ligand from Pd nanosheets by simply aging the sample in ethanol at room temperature. This slow process allows for atomic reconstruction without altering the sheet morphology. When exposed to e-beam irradiation or working as an electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation, the aged Pd nanosheets show enhanced stability.

         <title>Molecularly generated light and its biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Is it possible that light can be formulated as capsules, injection solutions, and packed into polymers? Yes, if the light is generated from molecules. The concept of &#8220;molecular light&#8221; has the potential to significantly expand our perspectives on the potential applications of light.







Abstract
Molecularly generated light, referred to here as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, mainly includes bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, and Cerenkov luminescence. Molecular light possesses unique dual features of being both a molecule and a source of light. Its molecular nature enables it to be delivered as molecules to regions deep within the body, overcoming the limitations of natural sunlight and physically generated light sources like lasers and LEDs. Simultaneously, its light properties make it valuable for applications such as imaging, photodynamic therapy, photo&#8208;oxidative therapy, and photobiomodulation. In this review article, we provide an updated overview of the diverse applications of molecular light and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of molecular light across various domains. Lastly, we present forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the potential of molecular light in the realms of molecular imaging, photobiological mechanisms, therapeutic applications, and photobiomodulation. While some of these perspectives may be considered bold and contentious, our intent is to inspire further innovations in the field of molecular light applications.

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Triggered by Multi&#8208;Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy has been developed to enable visible&#8208;light excited ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP). The multi&#8208;esterification strategy boosts transition dipole moments, leading to the most efficient UL&#8208;RTP in flexible films upon excitation with blue light, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in time&#8208;delayed white LEDs and flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.







Abstract
The development of ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP) in processable amorphous organic materials is highly desirable for applications in flexible displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bio&#8208;imaging. However, achieving efficient UL&#8208;RTP from amorphous materials remains a challenging task, especially with activation by visible light and a bright afterglow. Here we report a general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy to enable efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited UL&#8208;RTP by multi&#8208;esterification of a rigid large&#8208;plane phosphorescence core. Notably, multi&#8208;esterification minimizes the aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and accomplishes a &#8242;four birds with one stone&#8242; possibility in the generation and radiation process of UL&#8208;RTP: i) shifting the excitation from ultraviolet light to blue&#8208;light through enhancing the transition dipole moment of low&#8208;lying singlet&#8208;states, ii) facilitating the intersystem crossing process through the incorporation of lone&#8208;pair electrons, iii) boosting the decay process of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons resulting from a significantly increased transition dipole moment, and iv) reducing the intrinsic triplet nonradiative decay by substitution of high&#8208;frequency vibrating hydrogen atoms. All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible&#8208;light&#8208;stimulated UL&#8208;RTP (lifetime up to 2.01&#8197;s and efficiency up to 35.4&#8201;% upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm) in flexible films using multi&#8208;esterified coronene, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in single&#8208;component time&#8208;delayed white light&#8208;emitting diodes and information technology based on flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.

         <title>Direct Quantification of Nanoplastics Neurotoxicity by Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PS nanoplastics&#8208;induced reductions in exocytotic activity have been quantified by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggested that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of F&#8208;actin assemblies. This research provides key hints for deciphering how nanoplastics affect neurotransmitter secretion and neural functions.







Abstract
Nanoplastics are recently recognized as neurotoxic factors for the nervous systems. However, whether and how they affect vesicle chemistry (i.e., vesicular catecholamine content and exocytosis) remains unclear. This study offers the first direct evidence for the nanoplastics&#8208;induced neurotoxicity by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. We observe the cellular uptake of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics into model neuronal cells and mouse primary neurons, leading to cell viability loss depending on nanoplastics exposure time and concentration. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the reductions in the vesicular catecholamine content, the frequency of stimulated exocytotic spikes, the neurotransmitter release amount of single exocytotic event, and the membrane&#8208;vesicle fusion pore opening&#8208;closing speed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of filamentous actin (F&#8208;actin) assemblies at cytomembrane zones and change the kinetic patterns of vesicle exocytosis. Our finding shapes the first quantitative picture of neurotoxicity induced by high&#8208;concentration nanoplastics exposure at a single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Mobility&#8208;Modulated Sequential Dissociation Analysis Enables Structural Lipidomics in Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation acquisition method was developed for mass spectrometry imaging to enable spatial lipidomics capable of multiplexed MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids, using a robust spectrum deconvolution algorithm. From a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, this method revealed a phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) as a potential biomarker.







Abstract
Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery. But the structure&#8208;resolving capability of MSI is limited because of the lack of multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method, primarily due to the small sample amount available from each pixel and the poor ion usage in MS/MS analysis. Here, we report a mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation (MMSD) strategy for multiplex MS/MS imaging of distinct lipids from biological tissues. With ion mobility&#8208;enabled data&#8208;independent acquisition and automated spectrum deconvolution, MS/MS spectra of a large number of lipid species from each tissue pixel are acquired, at no expense of imaging speed. MMSD imaging is highlighted by MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids in the mouse brain and the revealing of the correlation of a structurally distinct phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Mapping of structurally distinct lipid isomers is now enabled and spatial lipidomics becomes feasible for MSI.

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Enabled by Noncovalent Interaction through Guest Insertion in Supercapacitors based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular insertion strategy is used by introducing non&#8208;covalent interactions in COFs to form a continuous charge transfer channel and accelerate the charge transfer rate. Meanwhile, the enhanced conductivity activates the redox sites in the COF skeleton, resulting in excellent energy storage performance. In addition, the energy storage behavior can be accurately regulated by changing the type of insertion guests.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI&#8722;COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI&#8722;COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs&#8208;based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs&#8208;based energy storage materials.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of a Vinyl Thianthrenium Salt and Secondary Alkyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report an unprecedented reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides, which expands on the currently possible reductive Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the first reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides. The reaction uses a vinyl thianthrenium salt, a palladium catalyst, and an alkyl zinc intermediate formed in situ to trap the LnPdII(vinyl) complex formed after oxidative addition before it undergoes undesired homocoupling to form butadiene.

         <title>Increasing Reduction Potentials of Type 1 Copper Center and Catalytic Efficiency of Small Laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor through Secondary Coordination Sphere Mutations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction potential of type&#8197;1 copper (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) in small laccase (SLAC) has been tuned through mutations of residues in the secondary coordination sphere, with the aim to mimic those in high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu fungal laccases. With three such mutations, we have increased E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu from wild&#8208;type SLAC by +189&#8197;mV to 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE, which is the highest reported to date. We have demonstrated additive E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu tuning of the three mutations and improved catalytic efficiency of the mutants relative to wild&#8208;type SLAC.







Abstract
The key to type 1 copper (T1Cu) function lies in the fine tuning of the CuII/I reduction potential (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) to match those of its redox partners, enabling efficient electron transfer in a wide range of biological systems. While the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) effects have been used to tune E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu in azurin over a wide range, these principles are yet to be generalized to other T1Cu&#8208;containing proteins to tune catalytic properties. To this end, we have examined the effects of Y229F, V290N and S292F mutations around the T1Cu of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor to match the high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of fungal laccases. Using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, together with X&#8208;ray crystallography and redox titrations, we have probed the influence of SCS mutations on the T1Cu and corresponding E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu. While minimal and small E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increases are observed in Y229F&#8208; and S292F&#8208;SLAC, the V290N mutant exhibits a major E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increase. Moreover, the influence of these mutations on E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu is additive, culminating in a triple mutant Y229F/V290N/S292F&#8208;SLAC with the highest E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE reported to date. Further activity assays indicate that all mutants retain oxygen reduction reaction activity, and display improved catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) relative to WT&#8208;SLAC.

         <title>Fast and Selective Luminescent Sensing by Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer Films Based on Controlled Assembly of Perylene Bisimide Modified with A Cyclometalated AuIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene bisimide modified by cyclometalated AuIII complex with unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model in crystalline state was synthesized and employed for controlled fabrication of monolayer films via the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. Based on the film, a conceptual luminescent sensor was further developed, which allowed high&#8208;performance sensing of a new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine.







Abstract
Condensed films of functional luminophores dominated by the magnitude and dimensionality of the intermolecular interactions play important roles in sensing performance. However, controlling the molecular assembly and regulating photophysical properties remain challenging. In this study, a new luminophore, ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au, was synthesized by anchoring a cyclometalated alkynyl&#8208;gold(III) unit at the ortho&#8208;position of perylene bisimide. An unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model driven by weak Au&#8208;&#960; interaction and Au&#8722;H bonds was observed, laying foundation for striking properties of the luminophore. Controlled assembly of ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au at the air&#8208;water interface, realized using the classical Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique, afforded the obtained luminescent films with different packing structures. With an optimized film, sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of a hazardous new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine (PEA), was achieved. The detection limit, response time, and recovery time were &lt;4&#8197;ppb, &lt;1&#8197;s, and &lt;5&#8197;s, respectively, surpassing the performance of the PEA sensors known thus far. The relationship between the characters of films and the sensing performance was systematically examined by grey relational analysis (GRA). The present study suggests that designing novel molecular aggregation with definite adlayer structure is a crucial strategy to enhance the sensing performance, which could be favorable for the film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors.

         <title>Breaking Surface Atomic Monogeneity of Rh2P Nanocatalysts by Defect&#8208;Derived Phosphorus Vacancies for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;derived surface phosphorus vacancies on ultrathin Rh2P nanowires break the monogeneity and atomic regularity of thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces, which can create additional Rh sites to act as exclusive H adsorption sites and diminish the inhibition effect of the interfacial water network to achieve drastically improved alkaline HOR electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Breaking atomic monogeneity of catalyst surfaces is promising for constructing synergistic active centers to cope with complex multi&#8208;step catalytic reactions. Here, we report a defect&#8208;derived strategy for creating surface phosphorous vacancies (P&#8208;vacancies) on nanometric Rh2P electrocatalysts toward drastically boosted electrocatalysis for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This strategy disrupts the monogeneity and atomic regularity of the thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces. Density functional theory calculations initially verify that the competitive adsorption behavior of Had and OHad on perfect P&#8208;terminated Rh2P{200} facets (p&#8208;Rh2P) can be bypassed on defective Rh2P{200} surfaces (d&#8208;Rh2P). The P&#8208;vacancies enable the exposure of sub&#8208;surface Rh atoms to act as exclusive H adsorption sites. Therein, the Had cooperates with the OHad on the peripheral P&#8208;sites to effectively accelerate the alkaline HOR. Defective Rh2P nanowires (d&#8208;Rh2P NWs) and perfect Rh2P nanocubes (p&#8208;Rh2P NCs) are then elaborately synthesized to experimentally represent the d&#8208;Rh2P and p&#8208;Rh2P catalytic surfaces. As expected, the P&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched d&#8208;Rh2P NWs catalyst exhibits extremely high catalytic activity and outstanding CO tolerance for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis, attaining 5.7 and 14.3&#8197;times mass activity that of p&#8208;Rh2P NCs and commercial Pt/C, respectively. This work sheds light on breaking the surface atomic monogeneity for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Macrocyclic Encapsulation in a Non&#8208;fused Tetrathiophene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with High Short&#8208;Circuit Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor R4T&#8208;1 was designed via macrocyclic encapsulation on the simple tetrathiophene, which achieves conformational unicity, eliminates intermolecular electronic cross&#8208;communication at the center and guarantees the formation of efficient charge transport channels. Thus, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.10&#8201;% with a significantly enhanced short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2 was accomplished.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors have shown great promise for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, challenges in achieving high efficiency molecular system with conformational unicity and effective molecular stacking remain. In this study, we present a new design of non&#8208;fused tetrathiophene acceptor R4T&#8208;1 via employing the encapsulation of tetrathiophene with macrocyclic ring. The single crystal structure analysis reveals that cyclic alkyl side chains can perfectly encapsulate the central part of molecule and generate a conformational stable and planar molecular backbone. Whereas, the control 4T&#8208;5 without the encapsulation restriction displays cis&#8208; and twisted conformation. As a result, R4T&#8208;1 based OSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 15.10&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2, which is significantly improved by &#8776;30&#8201;% in relative to that of the control. Our findings demonstrate that the macrocyclic encapsulation strategy could assist fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors (FNEAs) to achieve a high photovoltaic performance and pave a new way for FNEAs design.

         <title>Tetra&#8208; and Hexavalent Siglec&#8208;8 Ligands Modulate Immune Cell Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siglec&#8208;8 is a potential therapeutic target for eosinophil&#8208; and mast&#8208;cell&#8208;related disorders. With structural modifications and oligo&#8208; to multivalent presentations, the low affinity of the natural ligand was decisively improved. As shown in immune cell assays, a biological effect is not only induced by a multivalent but also by a hexavalent ligand, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, shows only an antagonistic effect.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are generally characterized by poor affinities for their natural glycan ligands, predominantly due to the shallow and solvent&#8208;exposed binding sites. To overcome this drawback, nature has exploited multivalency to strengthen the binding by establishing multiple interactions simultaneously. The development of oligovalent structures frequently proved to be successful, not only for proteins with multiple binding sites, but also for proteins that possess a single recognition domain. Herein we present the syntheses of a number of oligovalent ligands for Siglec&#8208;8, a monomeric I&#8208;type lectin found on eosinophils and mast cells, alongside the thermodynamic characterization of their binding. While the enthalpic contribution of each binding epitope was within a narrow range to that of the monomeric ligand, the entropy penalty increased steadily with growing valency. Additionally, we observed a successful agonistic binding of the tetra&#8208; and hexavalent and, to an even larger extent, multivalent ligands to Siglec&#8208;8 on immune cells and modulation of immune cell activation. Thus, triggering a biological effect is not restricted to multivalent ligands but could be induced by low oligovalent ligands as well, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, showed an antagonistic effect.

         <title>Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of a Lanthanide Organic Metal Halide Cluster for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide clusters based on trivalent lanthanide ions have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Furthermore, the introduction of trivalent antimony (Sb3+) doping results in the emergence of new energy&#8208;level structures for electronic transitions, which enables precise control over the emission color by varying the excitation wavelength.







Abstract
The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln3+) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln3+ ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln3+ ions in light&#8208;emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8211;inorganic compound, (DMA)4LnCl7 (DMA+=[CH3NH2CH3]+, Ln3+=Ce3+, Tb3+), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex&#8208;De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb3+). The pristine (DMA)4LnCl7 compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln3+ and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90&#8211;100&#8201;%. Upon Sb3+ doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex&#8208;De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host&#8208;sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln3+ and Sb3+, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex&#8208;De emitters based on Ln3+ ions.

         <title>Al2O3&#8208;coated BiVO4 Photoanodes for Photoelectrocatalytic Regioselective C&#8722;H Activation of Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the regioselective activation of aromatic amines C&#8722;H bonds is reported using a BiVO4 photoanode coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 protective layer, overcoming the problems of low reactivity and poor stability in photoelectrocatalytic organic synthesis. The deposition of Al2O3 enables maintaining stable photocurrent and the yield of the target product dramatically increases from 48&#8201;% to 84&#8201;%. Beyond high efficiency and excellent repeatability, this photoelectrocatalytic strategy exhibits good functional group tolerance and environmental friendliness, making it promising for sustainable organic transformations.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry is becoming an innovative approach to organic synthesis. Generally, the current photoelectrocatalytic organic transformations suffer from limited reaction type, low conversion efficiency and poor stability. Herein, we develop efficient and stable photoelectrode materials using metal oxide protective layer, with a focus on achieving regioselective activation of amine compounds. Notably, our photoelectrochemistry process is implemented under mild reaction conditions and does not involve any directing groups, transition metals or oxidants. The results demonstrate that beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis exhibits high efficiency, remarkable repeatability and good functional group tolerance, highlighting its great potential for applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Near&#8208;Infrared Chlorinated Rylenecarboximide Fluorophores via Consecutive C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. These fluorophores show high fluorescence quantum yields, together with large Stokes shifts and high photostability, qualifying them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.







Abstract
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, PAI, is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. Owing to the rigid structure, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and pronounced push&#8208;pull substitution, these fluorophores show emission maxima up to 804&#8197;nm and large Stokes shifts. The extraordinarily high fluorescence quantum yields from 47&#8201;% to 70&#8201;% are attributed to chloro substitution in the bay positions of the perylene core. These characteristics, together with high photostability, qualify them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) with Brilliant Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with optimized two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) performance were constructed by building block modification and crystal engineering, showing good performance in two&#8208;photon cellular imaging applications.







Abstract
By synergistically employing four key strategies: (I)&#8197;introducing tetraphenylethylene groups as the central core unit with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, (II)&#8197;optimizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated length by extending the building block branches, (III)&#8197;incorporating flexible groups containing ethylenic bonds, and (IV)&#8197;applying crystal engineering to attain dense stacking mode and highly twisty conformation, we successfully synthesized a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibiting exceptional one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. Notably, when utilizing the fluorescently superior building block L2, HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;7 and HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;8 exhibiting high quantum yields (QY) of 82.1&#8201;% and 77.1&#8201;%, and ultrahigh two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections of 148959.5&#8197;GM and 123901.1&#8197;GM were achieved. These materials were successfully employed in one and two&#8208;photon excited lysosome&#8208;targeting cellular imaging. It is believed that this strategy, combining building block optimization and crystal engineering, holds significant potential for guiding the development of outstanding fluorescent HOF materials.

         <title>Continuous Nanospace in Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Investigated by 129Xe NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
129Xe NMR spectroscopy of a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline material fabricated using imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles revealed a spatiotemporally continuous void inside the column. The diameter of the channel&#8208;like nanospace was estimated to be 0.49&#8197;nm, and the diffusion coefficient of the Xe atoms inside the nanochannels was comparable to those of conventional microporous solid materials.







Abstract
Continuous nanopores within fluid materials could be used for novel chemical events such as the accommodation of guest molecules, unique arrays of the entrapped molecules, and chemical reactions in a dynamic molecular assembly. Columnar liquid crystals composed of a one&#8208;dimensionally stacked assembly of shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles form nanochannels owing to the intrinsic nanospace in the column. However, the existence of substantial nanoporosity has not been confirmed experimentally thus far. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we confirmed the presence of discrete and spatiotemporally continuous voids in a liquid&#8208;crystalline material. In 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of liquid crystalline columnar assembly of imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles under Xe atmosphere, the NMR signals of the Xe atoms entrapped in the liquid&#8208;crystalline macrocycle depended on the gas pressure and phase&#8208;transition temperatures. These results indicate that the encapsulation of Xe gas molecules within the discrete and oriented nanospaces of nanoporous liquid crystals is different from the homogeneous dissolution of the solute in an ordinary solution.

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy for ortho&#8208;Aminophenol Synthesis via Dearomative&#8208;Rearomative Coupling Between Aryl Azides and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of aryl azides with purple light in the presence of alcohols enables the direct preparation of challenging ortho&#8208;aminophenols. The process goes via a singlet nitrene&#8208;mediated dearomative&#8208;rearomative cascade that enables introduction of the alcohol in place of the azide and shifts the amino group to its ortho&#8208;position.







Abstract
ortho&#8208;Aminophenols are aromatic derivatives featuring vicinal N&#8208; and O&#8208;based functionalities commonly found in the structures of many high&#8208;value materials. These molecules are generally prepared using multistep strategies that follow the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Despite their high fidelity, such approaches cannot target substrates featuring a &#8220;contra&#8208;SEAr&#8221; arrangement of N&#8208; and O&#8208;groups. Here we report an alternative strategy for the preparation of such ortho&#8208;aminophenols using aryl azides as the precursors. The process utilizes low&#8208;energy photoexcitation to trigger the decomposition of aryl azides into singlet nitrenes that undergo a dearomative&#8208;rearomative sequence. This allows the incorporation of alcoholic nucleophiles into a seven&#8208;membered ring azepine intermediate via temporary disruption of aromaticity, followed by electrophile&#8208;induced re&#8208;aromatization. The net retrosynthetic logic is that the alcohol displaces the azide, which, in turn, moves to its ortho position and furthermore is converted into an amide. The synthetic value and complementarity of this strategy has been demonstrated by the coupling of aryl azides with complex, drug&#8208;like alcohols and phenols as well as amines, thiols and thiophenols, which provides a general platform for the fast and selective heterofunctionalization of aromatics.

A BaTiO3 lattice is shown in the background of the cover picture, with the stack of orange balls symbolizing Cu nanoparticles. Pipes delivering the reactants and products have the shapes of H&#8722; and e&#8722; indicating they are involved in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. Lattice O is replaced with hydrides for the enhanced performance in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, as demonstrated by Zili Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202313389).

The dynamic interplay between a copper electrode and a reactive ionic liquid is illustrated in the cover picture, showcasing key components in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The role of the cation in covering the electrode surface and the in&#8208;situ generated hydrogen bond donor from CO2&#160;binding to the ionic liquid in enhancing the kinetics were uncovered by in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, complemented by electroanalytical and computational methods. Multi&#8208;carbon products with reduced reaction energy were obtained, as reported by Burcu Gurkan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312163). Cover image credit: Miguel Munoz.

The successful creation of &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; protein nanocrystals, which demonstrate ultra&#8208;rapid crystalline cross&#8208;linking behavior at pH levels above 7.6, underpins the concept of a protein conformation proton transistor. As reported by Peng Yang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202310879), this pH&#8208;triggered cross&#8208;linking can be feasibly accomplished under conditions that resemble physiological environments, highlighting its significant potential in biomedicine, biosensing, and microfluidic chemistry.

         <title>Back Cover: Exploration of Chemical Diversity in Intercellular Quorum Sensing Signalling Systems in Prokaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide chemical diversity in bacterial languages is explored in the Research Article by Markus B. Linder et&#8197;al. (e202314469). The structural similarities were mapped theoretically and sets of both closely related and widely diverging ligand structures experimentally investigated. The results suggest that structural diversity in quorum sensing ligands can be used as a starting point to predict non&#8208;cognate binding in intercellular signalling systems. Orthogonal signalling systems could significantly advance our engineering capabilities of microbial communities.

         <title>Methylene C(sp3)&#8211;H Arylation&#160;Enables the Stereoselective Synthesis and Structure Revision of Indidene Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The divergent synthesis of two indane polyketides of the indidene family, namely (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A (11 steps, 1.7%) and (+)&#8208;indidene C (13 steps, 1.3%), is reported. The synthesis of the trans&#8208;configured common indane intermediate was enabled by Pd0&#8208;catalyzed methylene C(sp3)&#8211;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective (e.r. &gt;99:1) modes. Further elaboration of this common intermediate by Ni&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling allowed the rapid installation of the aroyl moiety of (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A. In parallel, the biphenyl system of (&#177;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;indidene C was constructed via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. These investigations led us to revise the structures of indidenes B and C.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of a Reactive [Mn(III)&#8211;O&#8211;Ce(IV)] Species and its Facile Equilibrium with Related Mn(IV)(OX) (X = Sc or H) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acid&#8208;bound high valent Mn&#8208;oxo species are of great importance due to their relevance to photosystem II. Here we report the synthesis of a unique [(BnTPEN)Mn(III)&#8211;O&#8211;Ce(IV)(NO3)4]+ adduct (2), by the reaction of (BnTPEN)Mn(II) (1) with 4 eq. ceric ammonium nitrate. 2 has been characterized using UV/Vis, NMR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry. Treatment of 2 with Sc(III)(OTf)3 results in the formation of (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8211;O&#8211;Sc(III) (3), while HClO4 addition to 2 forms (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8211;OH (4), reverting to 2 upon Ce(III)(NO3)3 addition. 2 can also be prepared by the oxidation of 1 eq. Ce(III)(NO3)3 with [(BnTPEN)Mn(IV)=O]2+ (5). In addition, the EPR spectroscopy revealed the elegant temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium between 2 and Mn(IV) species. The binding of redox&#8208;active Ce(IV) boosts electron transfer efficiency of 2 towards ferrocenes. Remarkably, the newly characterized Mn(III)&#8211;O&#8211;Ce(IV) species can carry out O&#8208;atom and H&#8208;atom transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>AIEgens Cross&#8208;linked Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Synchronously Amplify Bimodal Imaging Signals in Situ by Tumor Acidity&#8208;Mediated Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the aggregation&#8208;enhanced r2 relaxivity of iron oxide nanoparticles and the aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of AIEgens, a non&#8208;conjugated/coupled dual&#8208;mode probe design strategy is developed to synergistically enhance both near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance contrast.







Abstract
Activatable dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging probes present a promising tool for the diagnosis of malignant tumors. However, synchronously enhancing dual&#8208;modal imaging signals under a single stimulus is challenging. Herein, we propose an activatable bimodal probe that integrates aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) to synergistically enhance near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast through a tumor acidity&#8208;mediated click reaction. Tumor acidity&#8208;responsive IOs containing dibenzocyclooctyne groups (termed cDIOs) and AIEgens containing azide groups (termed AATs) can be covalently cross&#8208;linked in response to tumor acidity, which leads to a simultaneous enhancement in NIRF intensity (&#8776;12.4&#8208;fold) and r2 relaxivity (&#8776;2.8&#8208;fold). cDIOs and AATs were effectively activated in mice orthotropic breast tumor, and the cross&#8208;linking prolonged their retention in tumor, further augmenting the bimodal signals and expanding imaging time frame. This facile strategy leverages the inherent properties of probes themselves and demonstrates promise in future translational studies.

         <title>Combinatorial Ligand Assisted Simultaneous Control of Axial and Central Chirality in Highly Stereoselective C&#8722;H Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The significance of stereoselective C&#8722;H bond functionalization thrives on its direct application potential to pharmaceuticals or complex chiral molecule synthesis. Complication arises when there are multiple steregenic elements such as a center and an axis of chirality to control. Over the years cooperative assistance of multiple chiral ligands has been applied to control only chiral centers. In this work, we harness the essence of cooperative ligand approach to control two different stereogenic elements in the same molecule by atroposelective allylation to synthesize axially chiral biaryls from its racemic precursor. The crucial roles played by chiral phosphoric acid and chiral amino acid ligand in concert helped us obtain one major stereoisomer out of four distinct possibilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Analgesic Buxus alkaloids with Enhanced Selectivity for the Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Gated Calcium Channel Cav3.2 over Cav3.1 through a New Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (LVGCCs; Cav3.1&#8208;3.3) represent promising drug targets for epilepsy, pain, and essential tremor. At present, modulators with heightened selectivity for a subtype  LVGCCs are still highly desired. Here, we explored three classes of Buxus alkaloids and identified 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type ones Buxusemine H and Buxusemine L (BXSL) as an unprecedented type of Cav3.2 inhibitors. Particularly, BXSL exhibited Cav3.2 inhibition comparable to Z944, a non&#8208;subtype&#8208;selective LVGCCs inhibitor under clinical trial. While lacking specificity for Cav3.3, BXSL showed a 30&#8208;fold selectivity of Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. Compared to several well&#8208;known inhibitors, the experimental and computational studies suggested BXSL exhibits a distinct binding mode to Cav3.2, notably through the essential interaction with serine&#8208;1543 in domain III. Furthermore, BXSL showed minimal impact on various recombinant and native nociceptive ion channels, while significantly reducing the excitability of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Animal studies in wild&#8208;type and Cav3.2 knock&#8208;out mice revealed that BXSL (5 mg/kg), by inhibiting Cav3.2, exhibits an analgesic effect equivalent to Z944 (10 mg/kg) or mibefradil (10 mg/kg). Moreover, we proposed a structural rationale for 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type alkaloids towards their high selectivity of Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. This study introduces a novel analgesic agent and valuable molecular insights for structure&#8208;based innovative Cav3.2 drug development.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-voltage-gated calcium channels (LVGCCs; Cav3.1-3.3) represent promising drug targets for epilepsy, pain, and essential tremor. At present, modulators with heightened selectivity for a subtype  LVGCCs are still highly desired. Here, we explored three classes of Buxus alkaloids and identified 9(10/19)abeo-artane-type ones Buxusemine H and Buxusemine L (BXSL) as an unprecedented type of Cav3.2 inhibitors. Particularly, BXSL exhibited Cav3.2 inhibition comparable to Z944, a non-subtype-selective LVGCCs inhibitor under clinical trial. While lacking specificity for Cav3.3, BXSL showed a 30-fold selectivity of Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. Compared to several well-known inhibitors, the experimental and computational studies suggested BXSL exhibits a distinct binding mode to Cav3.2, notably through the essential interaction with serine-1543 in domain III. Furthermore, BXSL showed minimal impact on various recombinant and native nociceptive ion channels, while significantly reducing the excitability of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Animal studies in wild-type and Cav3.2 knock-out mice revealed that BXSL (5 mg/kg), by inhibiting Cav3.2, exhibits an analgesic effect equivalent to Z944 (10 mg/kg) or mibefradil (10 mg/kg).

         <title>Determination of Reaction Kinetics by Time&#8208;Resolved Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray Scattering during Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Direct Evidence for Monomer&#8208;Swollen Nanoparticles.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetics of heterogeneous polymerization is determined directly using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). This important advance is exemplified for the synthesis of sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) in mineral oil at 90 &#176;C. The principle of mass balance is invoked to derive a series of equations for the analysis of the resulting time&#8208;resolved SAXS patterns. Importantly, there is a continuous change in the X&#8208;ray scattering length density for the various components within the reaction mixture. This enables the volume fraction of unreacted BzMA monomer to be calculated at any given time point, which enables the polymerization kinetics to be monitored in situ directly without relying on supplementary characterization techniques. Moreover, SAXS enables the local concentration of both monomer and solvent within the growing swollen nanoparticles to be determined during the polymerization. The analysis reveals that the instantaneous rate of BzMA polymerization is proportional to the local monomer concentration within the nanoparticles. In principle, this powerful new time&#8208;resolved SAXS approach should be applicable to other heterogeneous polymerization formulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefination of Aromatic Carbonyls via Site&#8208;Specific Activation of Cycloalkanone Ketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing is an important strategy in organic synthesis as it modifies the carbon backbone to tailor molecular structures with precision, enabling access to compounds with specific desired properties. Skeletal editing empowers chemists to transform synthetic approaches of target compounds across diverse applications from drug discovery to materials science. Herein, we introduce a new skeletal editing method to convert readily available aromatic carbonyl compounds into valuable unsaturated carboxylic acids with extended carbon chains. Our reaction setup enable a cascade reaction of enolization&#8208;[2+2]cycloaddition&#8208;[2+2]cycloreversion between aromatic carbonyl compounds and ketals of cyclic ketones to generate unsaturated carboxylic acids as ring&#8208;opening products. Through a simple design, our substrates are specifically activated to react at predetermined positions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. This practical method offers convenient access to versatile organic building blocks as well as provides fresh insights into manipulating traditional reaction pathways for new synthetic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Hysteresis and High&#8208;Toughness Hydrogels Regulated by Porous Cationic Polymers: the Effect of Counteranions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Service life and range of polymer materials is heavily reliant on their elasticity and mechanical stability under long&#8208;term loading. Slippage of chain segments under load leads to significant hysteresis of the hydrogels, limiting its repeatability and mechanical stability. Achieving the desired elasticity exceeding that of rubber is a great challenge for hydrogels, particularly when subjected to large deformations. Here, low&#8208;hysteresis and high&#8208;toughness hydrogels were developed through controllable interactions of porous cationic polymers (PCPs) with adjustable counteranions, including reversible bonding of PCP frameworks/polymer segments (polyacrylamide, PAAm) and counteranions/PAAm. This strategy reduces chain segment slippage under load, endowing the PCP&#8208;based hydrogels (PCP&#8208;gels) with good elasticity under large deformations (7% hysteresis at a strain ratio of 40). Furthermore, due to the enlarged chain segments entanglement by PCP, the PCP&#8208;gels exhibit large strain (13000%), significantly enhanced toughness (68 MJ m&#8208;3), high fracture energy (43.1 kJ m&#8208;2), and fatigue resistance. The unique properties of these elastic PCP&#8208;gels have promising applications in the field of flexible sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene Incorporated Thiazole Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing polymers with high electrical conductivity (&#963;) after n&#8208;doping is a great challenge for the advance of the field of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we report a series of thiazole imide&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers by gradually increasing selenophene content in polymeric backbone. Thanks to the strong intramolecular noncovalent N&#183;&#183;&#183;S interaction and enhanced intermolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;Se interaction, with the increase of selenophene content, the polymers show gradually lowered LUMOs, more planar backbone conformation, and improved film crystallinity versus the selenophene&#8208;free analogue. Consequently, polymer PDTzSI&#8208;Se with the highest selenophene content achieves a champion &#963; of 164.0 S cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 49.0 &#181;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2 in the series when applied to OTEs after n&#8208;doping. The &#963; value is the highest one for n&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor OTE materials reported to date. Our work indicates that selenophene substitution is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OTE materials and selenophene incorporated thiazole imides offer an excellent platform in enabling n&#8208;type polymers with high backbone coplanarity, deep&#8208;lying LUMO and enhanced mobility/conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8722;Cu Atomic Pair Sites for Efficient Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Electricity Generation with Zn&#8208;NO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of environmentally sustainable and highly efficient technologies for ammonia production is crucial for the future advancement of carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems. The nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) for generating NH3 is a promising alternative to the low&#8208;efficiency nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), owing to the low N=O bond energy and high solubility of nitrite. In this study, we designed a highly efficient dual&#8208;atom catalyst with Fe&#8722;Cu atomic pair sites (termed FeCu DAC), and the as&#8208;developed FeCu DAC was able to afford a remarkable NH3 yield of 24,526 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mgcat.&#8211;1 at &#8211;0.6 V, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for NH3 production of 99.88%. The FeCu DAC also exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in a Zn&#8208;NO2 battery, achieving a record&#8208;breaking power density of 23.6 mW cm&#8211;2 and maximum NH3 FE of 92.23% at 20 mA cm&#8211;2. Theoretical simulation demonstrated that the incorporation of the Cu atom changed the energy of the Fe 3d orbital and lowered the energy barrier,&#160;thereby accelerating the NO2RR.&#160;This study not only demonstrates the potential of galvanic nitrite&#8208;based cells for expanding the field of Zn&#8208;based batteries, but also provides fundamental interpretation for the synergistic effect in highly dispersed dual&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS) Assay for Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection of Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the development of a method for the electrochemical ultrasensitive detection of antibodies that couples the programmability and versatility of DNA&#8208;based systems with the sensitivity provided by enzymatic amplification. The platform, termed Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS), is based on the use of antigen&#8208;DNA conjugates that, upon the bivalent binding of a specific target antibody, induce the release of an enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand from a preformed duplex. Such enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand can then be electrochemically detected with a disposable electrode with high sensitivity. We applied ELIDIS to demonstrate the sensitive (limit of detection in the low picomolar range), specific and multiplexed detection of five different antibodies including three clinically relevant ones. ELIDIS is also rapid (it only requires two reaction steps), works well in complex media (serum) and is cost&#8208;effective. A direct comparison with a commercial ELISA kit for the detection of Cetuximab demonstrates the promising features of ELIDIS as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care platform for antibodies detection.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we report the development of a method for the electrochemical ultrasensitive detection of antibodies that couples the programmability and versatility of DNA-based systems with the sensitivity provided by enzymatic amplification. The platform, termed Enzyme-Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS), is based on the use of antigen-DNA conjugates that, upon the bivalent binding of a specific target antibody, induce the release of an enzyme-DNA hybrid strand from a preformed duplex. Such enzyme-DNA hybrid strand can then be electrochemically detected with a disposable electrode with high sensitivity. We applied ELIDIS to demonstrate the sensitive (limit of detection in the low picomolar range), specific and multiplexed detection of five different antibodies including three clinically relevant ones. ELIDIS is also rapid (it only requires two reaction steps), works well in complex media (serum) and is cost-effective. A direct comparison with a commercial ELISA kit for the detection of Cetuximab demonstrates the promising features of ELIDIS as a point-of-care platform for antibodies detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Oxyanion Self&#8208;Transformation on NiFe Oxalates Enables Long&#8208;Term Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seawater electrolysis is an attractive way of making H2 in coastal areas, and NiFe&#8208;based materials are among the top options for alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). However, ample Cl&#8722; in seawater can severely corrode catalytic sites and lead to limited lifespans. Herein, we report that in&#8208;situ carbon oxyanion self&#8208;transformation (COST) from oxalate to carbonate on a monolithic NiFe oxalate micropillar electrode allows safeguard of high&#8208;valence metal reaction sites in ASO. In&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ studies show that spontaneous, timely, and appropriate COST safeguards active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during ASO even at an ampere&#8208;level current density (j). Our NiFe catalyst shows efficient and stable ASO performance, which requires an overpotential as low as 349 mV to attain a j of 1 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the NiFe catalyst with protective surface CO32&#8722; exhibits a slight activity degradation after 600 h of electrolysis under 1 A cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. This work reports effective catalyst surface design concepts at the level of oxyanion self&#8208;transformation, acting as a momentous step toward defending active sites in seawater&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Aggregates of Thiophene&#8208;based Trimers by Methyl Side&#8208;chain Engineering for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors (OCSs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional inorganic materials for photocatalysis. However, the aggregation of OCSs in photocatalytic aqueous solution caused by self&#8208;assembly, which closely relates to the photocatalytic activity, has not yet been studied. Here, the relationship between the aggregation of 4,7&#8208;Bis(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzothiadiazole (TBT) and the photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated by introducing and varying the position of methyl side chains on the two peripheral thiophene units. Experimental and theoretical results indicated that the introduction of &#8208;CH3 group at the 3&#8208;position of TBT resulted in the smallest size and best crystallinity of aggregates compared to that of TBT, 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions. As a result, TBT&#8208;3 exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity towards H2 evolution, ascribed to the shorten charge carrier transport distance and solid long&#8208;range order.&#160; These results suggest the important role of aggregation behavior of OCSs for efficient photocatalysis.</dc:description>

Experimental and theoretical results indicated that the introduction of -CH3 group at the 3-position of TBT resulted in the smallest size and best crystallinity of aggregates compared to that of TBT, 4- and 5-positions. As a result, TBT-3 exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity towards H2 evolution, ascribed to the shorten charge carrier transport distance and solid long-range order.&#160; These results suggest the important role of aggregation behavior of OCSs for efficient photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Well&#8211;defined N3C1&#8211;anchored Single&#8211;Metal&#8211;Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8211;, C&#8211;, O&#8211;, S&#8211;coordinated single&#8211;metal&#8211;sites (SMSs) have garnered significant attention due to the potential for significantly enhanced catalytic capabilities resulting from charge redistribution. Nevertheless, substantial challenges persist in the precise design of well&#8211;defined such SMSs, and the fundamental comprehension has long been impeded in case&#8211;by&#8211;case reports by using carbon materials as investigation targets.&#160;&#160;In this work, the well&#8211;defined molecular catalysts with N3C1&#8211;anchored SMSs, i.e., N&#8211;confused metalloporphyrin (NCPor&#8211;Ms), are calculated for their catalytic oxygen reduction activity. Then, NCPor&#8211;Ms with corresponding N4&#8211;anchored SMSs (metalloporphyrin, Por&#8211;Ms), are synthesized for catalytic activity evaluation. Among all, NCPor&#8211;Co reaches the top in established volcano plots. NCPor&#8211;Co also shows the highest half&#8211;wave potential of 0.83 V vs. RHE in alkaline medium, which is much better than that of Por&#8211;Co (0.77 V vs. RHE). High&#8211;valence Co(III) and lower bandgap are responsible to the easier capturing intermediate *OOH for NCPor&#8211;Co in comparison with Por&#8211;Co. Moreover, the d&#8211;band center regulation contributes to the high activity of NCPor&#8211;Co.&#160;This study delves into the examination of well&#8211;defined asymmetric SMS molecular catalysts, encompassing both theoretical and experimental facets. It serves as a pioneering step towards enhancing the fundamental comprehension and facilitating the development of high&#8211;performance asymmetric SMS catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Chemo&#8208; and Biocatalytic Route to 16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids: Asymmetric Synthesis of Betamethasone Dipropionate, Clobetasol Propionate, and Beclomethasone Dipropionate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids are among the most important glucocorticoid steroids for the treatment of various dermatological disorders, respiratory infections, and other allergic reactions elicited during inflammatory responses of the human body. Betamethasone dipropionate, clobetasol propionate, and beclomethasone dipropionate are particularly noteworthy for their synthetic intractability. Despite five decades of research, these 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids have remained challenging synthetic targets owing to insurmountable issues of reactivity, selectivity, and cost efficiency associated with all previously explored strategies. We herein report our practicability&#8208;oriented strategy toward the unified stereoselective synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids in 12.6&#8208;14.0% overall yield from commercially available 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxyandrost&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3,17&#8208;dione (9&#945;&#8208;OH&#8208;AD). In this approach, the chiral C16&#946;&#8208;Me and C17&#945;&#8208;OH groups of the corticosteroid D ring were installed via a substrate&#8208;controlled diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8211;reduction hydration of &#916;4,9(11),16&#8208;triene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The C1&#8211;C2 double bond of the corticosteroid A ring was constructed using an unprecedented engineered 3&#8208;ketosteroid&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (MK4&#8208;KstD)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation of &#916;4,9(11)&#8208;diene&#8208;3,21&#8208;dione. This strategy provides a general method and a key precursor for the divergent synthesis of a variety of glucocorticoids and related steroidal drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;assembly of Alanine&#8208;Tyramine Conjugates into Versatile, Uniform, Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Organic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) protocol that converts alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates into highly uniform enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocontainers by the action of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the aqueous medium under ambient conditions. The NP formation was possible with both enantiomers of alanine, and the average diameter could be varied from 150 nm to 250 nm (with a 5&#8208;12% standard deviation of as&#8208;prepared samples) depending on the precursor concentration. About 60% of the added HRP enzyme was entrapped within the NPs and was subsequently utilized towards post&#8208;synthetic modification of the NPs with phenolic compounds such as tyramine or tannic acid. One&#8208;pot multi&#8208;enzyme entrapment of Glucose oxidase (GOx) and peroxidase (HRP) within the NPs was also achieved. These GOx&#8208;HRP loaded NPs allowed multimodal detection of glucose, including that present in human saliva, with a limit of detection (LoD) value of 740 nM through fluorimetry. The NPs exhibited good cytocompatibility and were stable to changes in pH (acidic to basic), temperature, ultrasonication, and even the presence of organic solvent (EtOH) to a certain extent since they are stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding,&#160;p&#8208;p&#160;and CH&#8208;p&#160;interactions. The proposed&#160;e&#8208;DISA&#160;protocol can be widely expanded through designing diversified enzyme&#8208;responsive precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electro&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Catalysis for the Oxidative Aminocarbonylation of Arylboronic Acids to Amides from CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct CO2 electroreduction to valuable chemicals is critical for carbon neutrality, while its main products are limited to simple C1/C2 compounds, and traditionally, the anodic O2 byproduct is not utilized. We herein report a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that fully utilizes both cathodic (i.e., CO) and anodic (i.e., O2) products during overall CO2 electrolysis to produce valuable organic amides from arylboronic acids and amines in a separate chemical reactor, following the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation mechanism. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT)&#8208;incorporated silver and nickel hydroxide carbonate electrocatalysts were prepared for efficient coproduction of CO and O2 with Faradaic efficiencies of 99.3% and 100%, respectively. Systematic experiments, operando attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical studies reveal that HMT promotes *CO2 hydrogenation/*CO desorption for accelerated CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, and O2 inhibits reductive deactivation of the Pd(II) catalyst for enhanced oxidative aminocarbonylation, collectively leading to efficient synthesis of 10 organic amides with high yields of above 81%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic strategy for economically attractive CO2 conversion and amide synthesis, representing a new avenue to explore the full potential of CO2 utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Spin&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in a Chiro&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Iron Phthalocyanine Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic activity of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was highly increased by promoting the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on FePc axially coordinated by chiral&#8208;peptides (L and D enantiomers). By adjusting the peptides&#8242; handedness and length (chiral C number), the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR were optimized for developing highly efficient catalysts.







Abstract
The chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect (CISS) is a breakthrough phenomenon that has revolutionized the field of electrocatalysis. We report the first study on the electron spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction, ORR, using iron phthalocyanine, FePc, a well&#8208;known molecular catalyst for this reaction. The FePc complex belongs to the non&#8208;precious catalysts group, whose active site, FeN4, emulates catalytic centers of biocatalysts such as Cytochrome c. This study presents an experimental platform involving FePc self&#8208;assembled to a gold electrode surface using chiral peptides (L and D enantiomers), i.e., chiro&#8208;self&#8208;assembled FePc systems (CSAFePc). The chiral peptides behave as spin filters axial ligands of the FePc. One of the main findings is that the peptides&#8242; handedness and length in CSAFePc can optimize the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR. Moreover, the D&#8208;enantiomer promotes the highest electrocatalytic activity of FePc for ORR, shifting the onset potential up to 1.01&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline medium, a potential close to the reversible potential of the O2/H2O couple. Therefore, this work has exciting implications for developing highly efficient and bioinspired catalysts, considering that, in biological organisms, biocatalysts that promote O2 reduction to water comprise L&#8208;enantiomers.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygenative Skeletal Rearrangement of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines Using H2O and O2 as Oxygen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented oxygenative skeletal rearrangement reaction of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (TH&#946;Cs) was developed under mild conditions enabled by copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer oxidation, in which H2O and O2 act as oxygen sources to generate a unique 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline intermediate. The process involves a multistep sequence to enable the transformation of TH&#946;Cs to donaxanine&#8208;type heterocycles in an efficient manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unprecedented skeletal rearrangement reaction of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines enabled by copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron oxidative oxygenation, in which H2O and O2 act as oxygen sources to generate a unique 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline intermediate. The synthetic reactivity of 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline species was demonstrated by a unique multi&#8208;step bond cleavage and formation cascade. Using a readily available copper catalyst under open&#8208;air conditions, highly important yet synthetically difficult spiro[pyrrolidone&#8208;(3,1&#8208;benzoxazine)] products were obtained in a single operation. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of the natural products donaxanine and chimonamidine, as well as the 3&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;pyrroloindoline scaffold, in just one or two steps.

         <title>Photoredox Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalysed stereoconvergent Stille reaction is designed for the first time, allowing for the construction of a rich range of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity under exceptionally mild conditions. The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm in the realm of Stille reactions.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most common strategies for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. Despite notable strides in the advancement of the Stille reaction, persistent challenges persist in hindering its greener evolution. These challenges encompass multiple facets, such as the high cost of precious metals and ligands, the demand for various additives, and the slow reaction rate. In comparison to the dominant palladium&#8208;catalysed Stille reactions, cost&#8208;effective nickel&#8208;catalysed systems lag behind, and enantioconvergent Stille reactions of racemic stannanes remain undeveloped. Herein, we present a pioneering instance of nickel&#8208;catalysed enantioconvergent Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions of racemic stannane reagents, resulting in the formation of C&#8722;C bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. This strategy provides a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under exceptionally mild conditions (without additives and bases, ambient temperature).

         <title>Length&#8208;Dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully fabricated atomically precise anthenes with varying lengths ranging from 2 to 6&#8197;anthryls. With increasing lengths, the ground states switch from S=0 (closed&#8208;shell bisanthene) to S=0 (open&#8208;shell teranthene). In longer anthenes, the charge transfer can switch magnetism from S=0 to S=1/2.







Abstract
Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;&#8208;electron state, which can be described as a spin&#8208;polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene.

     alt="Length-Dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We successfully fabricated atomically precise anthenes with varying lengths ranging from 2 to 6&#8197;anthryls. With increasing lengths, the ground states switch from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 (closed-shell bisanthene) to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 (open-shell teranthene). In longer anthenes, the charge transfer can switch magnetism from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=1/2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;-electron state, which can be described as a spin-polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene. Their magnetic evolution on the Au(111) surface was analyzed through bond-resolved scanning probe techniques and density functional theory calculations. The analyses revealed a transition in magnetic properties associated with the length of the anthenes, arising from the imbalance between hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. With the increasing length of the anthenes, the ground state transforms gradually from a closed-shell to an antiferromagnetic open-shell singlet, exhibiting a weak exchange coupling of 4&#8197;meV and a charge transfer-induced doublet. Therefore, this study formulated a chemically tunable platform to explore size-dependent &#960; magnetism at the atomic scale, providing a framework for research in organic spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>0D Pyramid&#8208;intercalated 2D Bimetallic Halides with Tunable Electronic Structures and Enhanced Emission under Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a new unique family of hybrid layered bimetallic halides with Cd/Cu as the MII site and Sb as the MIII site within the layered structure, with intercalated SbCl5 pyramids. These materials exhibit tunable electronic properties and optical band gaps from 2 to 3&#8197;eV. Using pressure as an external stimulus, the photoluminescence of the Cd analog is largely enhanced by 11&#8197;times.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are emerging semiconductors as potential candidates for optoelectronics. The pursuit of hybridizing various dimensions of metal halides remains a desirable yet highly complex endeavor. By utilizing dimension engineering, a diverse array of new materials with intrinsically different electronic and optical properties has been developed. Here, we report a new family of 2D&#8208;0D hybrid bimetallic halides, (C6N2H14)2SbCdCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCd) and (C6N2H14)2SbCuCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCu). These compounds adopt a new layered structure, consisting of alternating 0D square pyramidal [SbCl5] and 2D inorganic layers sandwiched by organic layers. SbCd and SbCu have optical band gaps of 3.3 and 2.3&#8197;eV, respectively. These compounds exhibit weak photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature, and the PL gradually enhances with decreasing temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that SbCd and SbCu are direct gap semiconductors, where first&#8208;principles band gaps follow the experimental trend. Moreover, given the different pressure responses of 0D and 2D components, these materials exhibit highly tunable electronic structures during compression, where a remarkable 11&#8197;times enhancement in PL emission is observed for SbCd at 19&#8197;GPa. This work opens new avenues for designing new layered bimetallic halides and further manipulating their structures and optoelectronic properties via pressure.

         <title>A Phosphine&#8208;Amine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Staggered Stacking Structure for Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional COF crystallizes via a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines, featuring an opposite staggered stacking of the interlocked dual layer in a unit cell. Post&#8208;quaternization on phosphazene moieties leads to the exfoliation of the staggered stacking COF into the few&#8208;layer ionized nanosheets, which can decouple lithium salts for rapid solid&#8208;state ion transport.







Abstract
In&#8208;plane ionic conduction over two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials is desirable for flexible electronics. Exfoliating 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards a few layers is highly anticipated, whereas most examples remain robust via &#960;&#8208;stacking against the interlayered dislocation. Herein, we synthesize a phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked 2D COF by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines. The synthesized COF is crystalline, and stacks in an AB&#8208;staggered fashion, wherein the AB dual layers are interlocked by embedding P&#8722;Cl bonds from one to another layer, and the non&#8208;interlocked layers are readily delaminated. Therefore, in situ post&#8208;quaternization over phosphazene can improve the ionization of backbones, accompanied by layered exfoliation. The ultrathin nanosheets can decouple lithium salts for fast solid&#8208;state ion transport, achieving a high conductivity and low activation energy. Our findings explore the P&#8722;N substitution reaction for COF crystallization and demonstrate that the staggered stacking 2D COFs are readily exfoliated for designing solid electrolytes.

         <title>Tunable Chirality of Self&#8208;Assembled Dipeptides Mediated by Bipyridine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;terminal&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide has been shown to proceed by multistep structural evolution involving spheres, right&#8208;handed helices and microribbons .A bipyridine derivative was introduced at different stoichiometric ratios to obtain thermodynamically stable chiral nanostructures (right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed helices). Ultrasound and enzyme catalysis are also effective strategies to regulate the chirality.







Abstract
Supramolecular peptide assemblies have been widely used for the development of biomedical, catalytical, and optical materials with chiral nanostructures in view of the intrinsic chirality of peptides. However, the assembly pathway and chiral transformation behavior of various peptides remain largely elusive especially for the transient assemblies under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Herein, the N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide (Fmoc&#8208;FY) was used as a peptide assembly platform, which showed that the assembly proceeds multistep evolution. The original spheres caused by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can nucleate and elongate into the formation of right&#8208;handed helices which were metastable and easily converted into microribbons. Interestingly, a bipyridine derivative can be introduced to effectively control the assembly pathway and induce the formation of thermodynamically stable right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices at different stoichiometric ratios. In addition, the chiral assembly can also be regulated by ultrasound or enzyme catalysis. This minimalistic system not only broadens the nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanisms of protein aggregates but also promotes the controllable design and development of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>Importing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy through Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd Bridge Promotes Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth oxides via an RE metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;mediated strategy to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR.







Abstract
The active&#8208;site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Pd&#8722;based materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are critical to their application in industrial energy devices. This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth (RE) oxides (Gd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and CeO2) by using RE metal&#8211;organic frameworks to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites through the Pd&#8722;RExOy interface interaction. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 induces the formation of the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd2O3. The screened Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 VRHE), half&#8208;wave potential (0.877&#8197;VRHE), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8722;Sm2O3/C, Pd&#8722;Eu2O3/C, and Pd&#8722;CeO2/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR. The pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8722;Gd2O3 is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.

This work constructs a series of carbon-based rare-earth (RE) oxides (Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by using RE metal&#8211;organic frameworks to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites through the Pd&#8722;RE&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; interface interaction. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induces the formation of the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The screened Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;), half-wave potential (0.877&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8722;Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C, Pd&#8722;Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C, and Pd&#8722;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding-orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate-determining step of ORR. The pH-dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C exhibits superior performance in Zn-air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Photo&#8208;Responsive Diphenylacetylene Enables PET In&#8208;Situ Upcycling with Reverse Enhanced UV&#8208;Resistance and Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the oligomer&#8208;scale, this work implements a novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for PET plastic wastes through tailored diphenylacetylene monomer. Uniquely, the dual photo&#8208;responses of diphenylacetylene enable upcycled PET plastics with reverse enhanced UV&#8208;resistance and strength.







Abstract
A novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for plastic waste is proposed by the customized diphenylacetylene monomer with dual photo&#8208;response. That is, diphenylacetylene reactive monomers are in situ inserted into the macromolecular chain of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics/fibers through one&#8208;pot transesterification of slight&#8208;depolymerization and re&#8208;polymerization. On the one hand, the diphenylacetylene group absorbs short&#8208;wave high&#8208;energy UV rays and then releases long&#8208;wave low&#8208;energy harmless fluorescence. On the other hand, the UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction among diphenylacetylene groups produces extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in a red&#8208;shift (due to decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO separation) in the UV absorption band and locked crosslink points between PET chains. Therefore, with increasing UV exposure time, the upcycled PET plastics exhibit reverse enhanced UV resistance and mechanical strength (superior to original performance), instead of serious UV&#8208;photodegradation and damaged performance. This upcycling strategy at oligomer&#8208;scale not only provides a new idea for traditional plastic recycling, but also solves the common problem of gradual degradation of polymer performance during use.

         <title>Dynamic Oscillation and Motion of Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intersection of surfactant partitioning, spontaneous emulsification, and substrate wettability generates a unique type of motion&#8212;droplet oscillation&#8212;rarely reported in the literature for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion systems. The effect of varying the concentration of the surfactant, substrate properties, and the chemical nature of the oil and surfactant on the oscillating droplets was studied.







Abstract
The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self&#8208;powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non&#8208;equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side&#8208;view optical microscopy. We propose that the changes in the interfacial tension of the oil droplets is due to the partitioning of the surfactant into the oil phase and the movement of self&#8208;emulsified oil out of the parent droplets giving rise to the rhythmic variation in droplet contact&#8208;line. The ability to control and understand droplet oscillation can help model similar oscillations in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in nature and reproduce biomimetic behavior in artificial systems for various applications, such as microfluidic lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and adaptive materials.

         <title>Potential Dominates Structural Recombination of Single Atom Mn Sites for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structural and valence state evolutions ranging from the initial Mn3.0&#8208;N4 to Mn3.8&#8208;N3C, followed by Mn3.2&#8208;N2C2, and ultimately returning to Mn3.0&#8208;N4 have been detected for Mn SAS during ORR by operando synchrotron radiation. The evolved configurations can regulate O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to promote ORR activity.







Abstract
Single atom sites (SAS) often undergo structural recombination in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the effect of valence state and reconstruction on active centers needs to be investigated thoroughly. Herein, the Mn&#8208;SAS catalyst with uniform and precise Mn&#8208;N4 configuration is rationally designed. We utilize operando synchrotron radiation to track the dynamic evolution of active centers during ORR. Under the applied potential, the structural evolution of Mn&#8208;N4 into Mn&#8208;N3C and further into Mn&#8208;N2C2 configurations is clarified. Simultaneously, the valence states of Mn are increased from +3.0 to +3.8 and then decreased to +3.2. When the potential is removed, the catalyst returned to its initial Mn+3.0&#8208;N4 configuration. Such successive evolutions optimize the electronic and geometric structures of active centers as evidenced by theory calculations. The evolved Mn+3.8&#8208;N3C and Mn+3.2&#8208;N2C2 configurations respectively adjust the O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, it can achieve an onset potential of 0.99&#8197;V, superior stability over 10,000 cycles, and a high turnover frequency of 1.59&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.85 VRHE. Our present work provides new insights into the construction of well&#8208;defined SAS catalysts by regulating the valence states and configurations of active centers.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;C Double Bond Cleavage of Alkenes Enabled by Highly Dispersed Cobalt Catalyst and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether was achieved by using single&#8208;atom cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including internal and terminal alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. Detailed mechanistic studies pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid assisted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.







Abstract
The utilization of a single&#8208;atom catalyst to break C&#8722;C bonds merges the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and presents an intriguing pathway for obtaining high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, a mild, selective, and sustainable oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether or nitrile was achieved by using atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.

         <title>Exploring Peptido&#8208;Nanocomposites in the Context of Amyloid Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review concerns the design principles, working mechanisms and application of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites against amyloidosis, a hallmark of amyloid diseases.







Abstract
Therapeutic peptides are a major class of pharmaceutical drugs owing to their target&#8208;binding specificity as well as their versatility in inhibiting aberrant protein&#8208;protein interactions associated with human pathologies. Within the realm of amyloid diseases, the use of peptides and peptidomimetics tailor&#8208;designed to overcome amyloidogenesis has been an active research endeavor since the late 90s. In more recent years, incorporating nanoparticles for enhancing the biocirculation and delivery of peptide drugs has emerged as a frontier in nanomedicine, and nanoparticles have further demonstrated a potency against amyloid aggregation and cellular inflammation to rival strategies employing small molecules, peptides, and antibodies. Despite these efforts, however, a fundamental understanding of the chemistry, characteristics and function of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites is lacking, and a systematic analysis of such strategy for combating a range of amyloid pathogeneses is missing. Here we review the history, principles and evolving chemistry of constructing peptido&#8208;nanocomposites from bottom up and discuss their future application against amyloid diseases that debilitate a significant portion of the global population.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Hydroacylations under Heterogeneous Chiral Rhodium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts were developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective hydroacylations. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's without the leaching of Rh. The catalysts exhibited a wide substrate scope and, in sequential&#8208;flow reactions, the flow syntheses of value&#8208;added chemicals were demonstrated.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H bond functionalizations have become efficient methods for the synthesis of complex optically active molecules. Heterogeneous catalysts for this chemistry remain largely unexplored despite the advantages they offer in terms of ease of separation and reuse of catalysts. Herein, we report the development of heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective hydroacylations. Heterogeneous catalysts could be prepared simply by mixing supports and Rh complexes. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a turnover number &gt;300 was achieved without the leaching of Rh species. The catalysts exhibited a wide substrate scope and in sequential&#8208;flow reactions with other heterogeneous catalysts, the syntheses of biologically active molecules and functional materials were demonstrated.

         <title>Organic Excitonic State Management by Surface Metallic Coupling of Inorganic Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to manipulate the electronic energy states of organic phosphors by coupling with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals NaGdF4 is reported. The metallic atoms introduce strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects to organic chromophores. The result demonstrates the ability of charge transfer mechanism to broaden the utility of organic phosphors.







Abstract
The ability to harness charges and spins for control of organic excitonic states is critical in developing high&#8208;performance organic luminophores and optoelectronic devices. Here we report a facile strategy to efficiently manipulate the electronic energy states of various organic phosphors by coupling them with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals. We show that the metallic atoms exposed on the nanocrystal surface can introduce strong coupling effects to 9&#8208;(4&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (OCzT) and some organic chromophores with carbazole functional groups when the organics are approaching the nanocrystals. This unconventional organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization enables a nearly 100&#8201;% conversion of the singlet excitation to fast charge transfer luminescence that does not exist in pristine organics, which broadens the utility of organic phosphors in hybrid systems.

         <title>Adjustable Plane Curvature of Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Outstanding Dielectric, Electret, and High&#8208;Temperature Processing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, the microstructure, dielectric, and electret properties of the covalent organic framework films are modulated by adjusting the ratio of 4,4&#8208;diamino biphenyl and 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenylmethane. The resulting films present excellent dielectric properties (ultralow dielectric constant (1.9), ultralow dielectric loss (0.0052) at 200&#8201;&#176;C) and are very promising for use in electronic devices serving in high&#8208;temperature environments.







Abstract
With the rapid development of integrated circuits towards miniaturization and complexity, there is an urgent need for materials with low dielectric constant/loss and high processing temperatures to effectively prevent signal delay and crosstalk. With high porosity, thermal stability, and easy structural modulation, covalent organic frameworks have great potential in the field of low dielectric materials. However, the optimization of dielectric properties by modulating the conjugated/plane curvature structure of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has rarely been reported. Accordingly, we herein innovatively prepare COF films with adjustable planar curvature, hence possessing ultralow dielectric constant (1.9 at 1&#8197;kHz), ultralow dielectric loss at 1&#8197;kHz (0.0029 at room temperature, 0.0052 at 200&#8201;&#176;C), high thermal decomposition temperature (5&#8201;% weight loss temperature, 473&#8201;&#176;C) and good hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 105.3&#176;). Also, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that the resulting COF film enables high surface potential (&#8776;320&#8197;V) for one week, attributing to its intrinsic high porosity, thus presenting great potential in electret applications. Accordingly, this innovative work provides a readily available and scalable idea to prepare materials with comprehensively excellent dielectric and electret properties as well as high processing temperatures simultaneously for advanced electronic device applications.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Macroscopic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry is usually employed for joining components at microscopic level, but unable for connecting macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize flexible manufacturing of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, of significance on parallel manufacturing. Herein, macroscopic click chemistry is achieved using hydrogels as macroscopic building blocks.







Abstract
The click reaction has found good utility across various fields due to the characteristics of high efficiency, atom economy, simple and mild reaction conditions. Click chemistry is usually utilized for connecting components of microscopic level, while it is still unable for joining macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize the flexible fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, exerting significance on parallel manufactures. In this work, we reported macroscopic click chemistry utilizing hydrogel as macroscopic building blocks. Hydrogels G1 and G2 were prepared by incorporating M1 (N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) and P1 (alkyne functionalized polyethylene glycol) respectively, where polymer chains formed through diffusion&#8208;induced amino&#8208;yne click reaction entangled different hydrogel networks together. Additionally, chain&#8208;like aggregates and complicated 3D structures such as tetrahedron and quadrangular pyramid were constructed based on the adhesion of the hydrogel blocks. The approach enables us to find more possibilities in the delicate designation of 3D aggregations as well as large&#8208;scale manufacturing.

         <title>Crystallization Regulation by Self&#8208;Assembling Liquid Crystal Template Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) was developed to modify buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSC). The ILC promotes a preferential growth of perovskite along [001] direction and exhibits strong interaction with perovskite to passivate defects. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers an efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.







Abstract
It is found that the disordered growth of bottom perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material to modify the buried interface for regulating the crystal growth and defect passivation is an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here, we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction, while the oriented ILC with mesomorphic phase has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect, as a result, the modified buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Sulfonylation of Yne&#8208;Allylic Esters with Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction was developed for the sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. Salient features of this practical method include readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Impressive progress has been made in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric propargylic substitution (APS) reaction, but its use in remote asymmetric yne&#8208;allylic substitution remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report the first remote enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. The reaction is assumed to occur via a copper&#8208;vinylvinylidene species as the key reactive intermediate. The use of readily available starting materials, the mild reaction conditions, and the excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), show the practicality and attractiveness of this method.

         <title>Azide Ionic Liquids for Safe, Green, and Highly&#8208;Efficient Azidation Reactions to Produce Azide Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;containing materials are widely applied in numerous fields, but always require undesired harsh synthetic conditions. This work establishes a safe, green, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide&#8208;containing materials by designing two novel azide ionic liquids, which can function as both reagents and solvents for highly efficient azidation reactions.







Abstract
Azide compounds are widely used and especially, polymers bearing pendant azide groups are highly desired in numerous fields. However, harsh reaction conditions are always mandatory to achieve full azidation, causing severe side reactions and degradation of the polymers. Herein, we report the design and preparation of two azide ionic liquids (AILs) with azide anion and triethylene glycol (E3)&#8208;containing cation, [P444E3][N3] and [MIME3][N3]. Compared with the traditional sodium azide (NaN3) approach, both AILs showed much higher reaction rates and functional&#8208;group tolerance. More importantly, they could act as both reagents and solvents for the quantitative azidation of various polymeric precursors under mild conditions. Theoretical simulations suggested that the outstanding performance of AILs originated from the existence of ion pairs during the reaction, and the E3 moieties played a crucial role. Lastly, after the reaction, the AILs could be easily regenerated, presenting a safer, greener, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide polymers.

         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal nanoparticles are constructed by ambient in situ &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation reduction and form strong interfacial coupling with defect&#8208;rich carriers through M&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds, accelerating electron transfer. The activated catalytic sites combined with oxygen vacancies lower the energy barrier and optimize the intermediates adsorption energy, resulting in an outstanding performance for GOR and HER.







Abstract
Developing novel synthesis technologies is crucial to expanding bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. Herein, we report an ambient and controllable &#947;&#8208;ray radiation reduction to synthesize a series of noble metal nanoparticles anchored on defect&#8208;rich manganese oxides (M@MnO2&#8208;x, M=Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) for glycerol&#8208;assisted H2 evolution. Benefiting from the strong penetrability of &#947;&#8208;rays, nanoparticles and defect supports are formed simultaneously and bridged by metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, guaranteeing structural stability and active site exposure. The special Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds activate the Ru and Mn sites in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x through strong interfacial coordination, driving glycerol electrolysis at low overpotential. Furthermore, only a low cell voltage of 1.68&#8197;V is required to achieve 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer system along with excellent stability. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals that the strong interfacial coordination in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x balances the competitive adsorption of glycerol and OH* on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the defect&#8208;rich MnO2 support promotes the dissociation of H2O, while the defect&#8208;regulated Ru sites promote deprotonation and hydrogen desorption, synergistically enhancing glycerol&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron Regulating Electronic Structure of Iron Atom Clusters for Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalyst, comprised of oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms and atom clusters anchored onto bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon, was successfully fabricated. This material exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 production and allowed for coupling by an electro&#8208;Fenton process, primarily owing to the active sites of Fe atom clusters with optimized electronic structure regulated by Fe single atoms, resulting in the suitable binding strength of the *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
The integration of highly active single atoms (SAs) and atom clusters (ACs) into an electrocatalyst is critically important for high&#8208;efficiency two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report a tandem impregnation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy to fabricate the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs and ACs anchored on bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon (BCC) (FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC). As the electrocatalyst, FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward 2e&#8722; ORR, affording an onset potential of 0.78&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 96.5&#8201;% in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. In a flow cell reactor, the FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC also achieves high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production with a yield rate of 12.51&#177;0.18&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 89.4&#8201;%&#177;1.3&#8201;% at 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the feasibility of coupling the produced H2O2 and electro&#8208;Fenton process for the valorization of ethylene glycol was explored in detail. The theoretical calculations uncover that the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs effectively regulate the electronic structure of Fe ACs which are the 2e&#8722; ORR active sites, resulting in the optimal binding strength of *OOH intermediate for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <title>Spiky Artificial Peroxidases with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe Pair Sites for Combating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for efficient and selective ROS&#8208;catalysis has been reported. We demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; bifunction from the spiky morphology and massive ROS (&#8901;OH and HClO) production, which efficiently eliminate MRSA and accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity.







Abstract
With the sharp rise of antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens worldwide, it is of enormous importance to create new strategies for combating pathogenic bacteria. Here, we create an iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase (POD) with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for combating methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; bifunction from the spiky morphology and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The V&#8208;Fe2O3 can reach nearly 100&#8201;% bacterial inhibition over a long period by efficiently oxidizing the lipid membrane. Our wound disinfection results identify that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can not only efficiently eliminate MRSA and their biofilm but also accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity. This work offers essential insights into the critical roles of V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites and localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; in biocatalytic disinfection and provides a promising pathway for the de novo design of efficient artificial peroxidases.

         <title>Tailored Zwitterionic Hemicyanine Reporters for Early Diagnosis and Prognostic Assessment of Acute Renal Failure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable reporter ZCRR is developed by masking zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanine with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8. Systematic administration of ZCRR enables sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise prediction of renoprotective therapeutic effects through in vitro optical urinalysis.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced renal failure (DIRF) poses a serious medical complication with high mortality risk. However, early diagnosis or prognosis of DIRF remain challenging, as current methods rely on detecting late&#8208;stage biomarkers. Herein we present a library of zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanines (ZCs) available for constructing activatable reporters to detect DIRF since its initial stage. Zwitterionic properties of these probes are achieved through interspersedly integrating alkyl sulfonates and quaternary ammonium cations onto hemicyanine skeleton, which result in record low plasma protein binding (&lt;5&#8201;%) and remarkable renal clearance efficiencies (&#8776;96&#8201;%). An activatable reporter ZCRR is further developed by masking the optimal candidate ZC6 with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8, an initiating indicator of apoptosis. In living mice with cisplatin&#8208;induced DIRF, systematically administered ZCRR efficiently accumulates in kidneys and responds to elevated caspase&#8208;8 for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals &#8216;turn&#8208;on&#8217;, enabling sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise evaluation of apoptosis remediation effects by different medications on DIRF mice. As it's urinary excretable, ZCRR also allows for remote detection of DIRF and predicting renoprotective efficacy through in vitro optical urinalysis. This study thus presents unimolecular renal clearable scaffolds that are applicable to developing versatile activatable reporters for renal diseases management.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reversible Multicolor Supramolecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinment of a spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene guest (BCNMC) in a cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) host has led to a light&#8208;driven multicolor luminescent supramolecular shuttle, which exhibits reversible conversion of the topological morphology. Alternating irradiation with visible light and the absence of light results in different fluorescence colors for information encryption.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven multicolor supramolecular systems mainly rely on the doping of dyes or a photo&#8208;reaction to produce unidirectional luminescence. Herein, we use visible light to drive the bidirectional reversible multicolor supramolecular shuttle from blue to green, white, yellow, up to orange by simple encapsulation of spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene (BCNMC) by the macrocyclic cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) monomer. The resultant host&#8211;guest complex displayed enhanced fluorescence properties, i.e. the multicolor fluorescence shuttle changed from blue to orange in the dark within 2&#8197;hours and reverted to the original state upon visible light irradiation for 30&#8197;s. Benefiting from the sensitivity of the spiropyran moiety to light, it can spontaneously isomerize from the ring&#8208;opened state to a ring&#8208;closed isomer in aqueous solution, and this photo&#8208;isomerization reaction is a reversible process under visible light irradiation, leading to the multicolor luminescence supramolecular shuttle as a result of intramolecular energy transfer. In addition, the light also drove the reversible conversion of the topological morphology of the host&#8211;guest complex from two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatelets to nanospheres. Different from the widely reported molecular rotaxane &#8220;shuttle&#8221;, the spiropyran supramolecular shuttle confined in the macrocyclic host CB[8] not only modulated a reversible topological morphology by light but also exhibited multicolor luminescence, which was successfully applied in programmed and rewritable information encryption.

         <title>Disulfide Click Reaction for Stapling of S&#8208;terminal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of disulfide linkers was established for Cys&#8722;Cys&#8722;(Cys) double/triple click stapling in only 1&#8197;min, bridging from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to deliver 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered locked peptides. The opposite unstapling process proceeded smoothly, making the reversible cross&#8208;linking reagents potentially suitable for peptide delivery.







Abstract
A disulfide click strategy is disclosed for stapling to enhance the metabolic stability and cellular permeability of therapeutic peptides. A 17&#8208;membered library of stapling reagents with adjustable lengths and angles was established for rapid double/triple click reactions, bridging S&#8208;terminal peptides from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to provide 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered macrocyclic peptides under biocompatible conditions. The constrained peptides exhibited enhanced anti&#8208;HCT&#8208;116 activity with a locked &#945;&#8208;helical conformation (IC50=6.81&#8197;&#956;M vs. biological incompetence for acyclic linear peptides), which could be unstapled for rehabilitation of the native peptides under the assistance of tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). This protocol assembles linear peptides into cyclic peptides controllably to retain the diverse three&#8208;dimensional conformations, enabling their cellular uptake followed by release of the disulfides for peptide delivery.

         <title>Promoting Syngas to Olefins with Isolated Internal Silanols&#8208;Enriched Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 Aluminosilicate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional catalyst composed of Zn2Al3O4 and Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pores and internal isolated silanols exhibits high propylene and butene selectivity accounting for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=. The weak acidity prohibited the second reaction of olefins and isolated internal SiOH groups and promoted the desorption of C3&#8211;4= molecules.







Abstract
Selective conversion of syngas to value&#8208;added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (P/E) and olefin/paraffin (O/P) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with recently approved &#8722;ION structure, composed of 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (MR) extra&#8208;large lobed pores and intersected 10&#8208;MR medium pores, shows a C2&#8211;6= selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high O/P value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with ZnaAlbOx oxide. Moreover, for the high&#8208;silica Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=, resulting in high P/E (&gt;4) and butene/ethylene (B/E &gt;3) ratios. The high C3&#8211;4= selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 zeolite enhances the olefin&#8208;based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) and 1&#8208;hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 promote the desorption of C3&#8211;4=, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.

&lt;p&gt;The bifunctional catalyst composed of Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Al-IDM-1 with 17-membered-ring pores and internal isolated silanols exhibits high propylene and butene selectivity accounting for 88&#8201;% in C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;. The weak acidity prohibited the second reaction of olefins and isolated internal SiOH groups and promoted the desorption of C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective conversion of syngas to value-added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (&lt;i&gt;P/E&lt;/i&gt;) and olefin/paraffin (&lt;i&gt;O/P&lt;/i&gt;) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al-IDM-1 with recently approved &#8722;&lt;b&gt;ION&lt;/b&gt; structure, composed of 17-membered-ring (MR) extra-large lobed pores and intersected 10-MR medium pores, shows a C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high &lt;i&gt;O/P&lt;/i&gt; value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with Zn&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; oxide. Moreover, for the high-silica Al-IDM-1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in high &lt;i&gt;P/E&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;gt;4) and butene/ethylene (&lt;i&gt;B/E&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;3) ratios. The high C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al-IDM-1 zeolite enhances the olefin-based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol-to-propylene (MTP) and 1-hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al-IDM-1 promote the desorption of C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limitations by Iodized Polyacrylonitrile Anodes for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodized polyacrylonitrile anodes (I&#8208;PAN) can regulate the bulk/interphase metal&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and metal&#8208;ion desolvation chemistry of the electrolyte, and simultaneously reutilize the dead/plated metal. Benefiting from these features, the unprecedented extremely fast&#8208;charging performance can be achieved for a series of metal (Li, Na)&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN as anodes.







Abstract
The fast&#8208;charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I&#8208;PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li&#8208;ion desolvation process to realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I&#8208;PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self&#8208;induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6&#8722; not only promote the Li&#8208;ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Consequently, the I&#8208;PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (39&#8201;% of capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The I&#8208;PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000&#8197;cycles at extremely high rates of 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=180&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). We also demonstrate high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN anodes.

         <title>A Fast Na&#8208;Ion Conduction Polymer Electrolyte via Triangular Synergy Strategy for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast Na&#8208;ion conduction polymer electrolyte was designed through a triangular synergy strategy, which limits the migration of ionic liquid and facilitates the dissociation of salt, resulting in a faster Na+ conduction in the polymer electrolyte. The modified polymer electrolyte led to a salt&#8208;decomposition dominated interphase, which effectively suppressed gas evolution from ionic liquid decomposition, ensuring battery safety.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes provide a visible pathway for the construction of high&#8208;safety quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high interface compatibility and processability. Nevertheless, sluggish ion transfer at room temperature seriously limits their applications. Herein, a triangular synergy strategy is proposed to accelerate Na&#8208;ion conduction via the cooperation of polymer&#8208;salt, ionic liquid, and electron&#8208;rich additive. Especially, PVDF&#8208;HFP and NaTFSI salt acted as the framework to stably accommodate all the ingredients. An ionic liquid (Emim+&#8208;FSI&#8722;) softened the polymer chains through a weakening molecule force and offered additional liquid pathways for ion transport. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that electron&#8208;rich Nerolin with &#960;&#8208;cation interaction facilitated the dissociation of NaTFSI and effectively restrained the competitive migration of large cations from EmimFSI, thus lowering the energy barrier for ion transport. The strategy resulted in a thin F&#8208;rich interphase dominated by NaTFSI salt's decomposition, enabling rapid Na+ transmission across the interface. These combined effects resulted in a polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (1.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and tNa+ (0.79) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled cells delivered reliable rate capability and stability (200 cycles, 99.2&#8201;%, 0.5&#8197;C) with a good safety performance.

         <title>Diadenosine Tetraphosphate (Ap4A) Serves as a 5&#8242; RNA Cap in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diadenosine tetraphosphate&#8208;RNA (Ap4A&#8208;RNA) is found in human and rat cell lines. Its amount is not dependent on the intracellular concentration of Ap4A. Ap4A&#8208;RNA is decapped by two enzymes, NUDT2 and DXO. Even though Ap4A&#8208;RNA is present in the same fraction as mRNA, it is not translated. However, it is recognized as self RNA by the innate immune system, as it does not elicit an immune response.







Abstract
The recent expansion of the field of RNA chemical modifications has changed our understanding of post&#8208;transcriptional gene regulation. Apart from internal nucleobase modifications, 7&#8208;methylguanosine was long thought to be the only eukaryotic RNA cap. However, the discovery of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps in eukaryotes revealed a new niche of previously undetected RNA chemical modifications. We are the first to report the existence of a new non&#8208;canonical RNA cap, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), in human and rat cell lines. Ap4A is the most abundant dinucleoside polyphosphate in eukaryotic cells and can be incorporated into RNA by RNA polymerases as a non&#8208;canonical initiating nucleotide (NCIN). Using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS), we show that the amount of capped Ap4A&#8208;RNA is independent of the cellular concentration of Ap4A. A decapping enzyme screen identifies two enzymes cleaving Ap4A&#8208;RNA,NUDT2 and DXO, both of which also cleave other substrate RNAs in vitro. We further assess the translatability and immunogenicity of Ap4A&#8208;RNA and show that although it is not translated, Ap4A&#8208;RNA is recognized as self by the cell and does not elicit an immune response, making it a natural component of the transcriptome. Our findings open a previously unexplored area of eukaryotic RNA regulation.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution through Local Field Distortion in Mg/Fe Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A regulation of the Fe spin state in a Mg&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst is realized by taking advantage of the local crystal field distortion induced by the large ionic radii difference between Fe/Mg. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting.







Abstract
Transition metal single atom electrocatalysts (SACs) with metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) configuration show great potential in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereby the spin&#8208;dependent electrons must be allowed to transfer along reactants (OH&#8722;/H2O, singlet spin state) and products (O2, triplet spin state). Therefore, it is imperative to modulate the spin configuration in M&#8722;N&#8722;C to enhance the spin&#8208;sensitive OER energetics, which however remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a local field distortion induced intermediate to low spin transition by introducing a main&#8208;group element (Mg) into the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C architecture, and decode the underlying origin of the enhanced OER activity. We unveil that, the large ionic radii mismatch between Mg2+ and Fe2+ can cause a FeN4 in&#8208;plane square local field deformation, which triggers a favorable spin transition of Fe2+ from intermediate (dxy2dxz2dyz1dz21, 2.96 &#956;B) to low spin (dxy2dxz2dyz2, 0.95 &#956;B), and consequently regulate the thermodyna&#8208;mics of the elementary step with desired Gibbs free energies. The as&#8208;obtained Mg/Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst demonstrates a superior OER activity with an overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the overall water splitting, which outperforms those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition metal SACs.

         <title>Maturation of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase: Direct Transfer of the (&#954;3&#8208;cysteinate)FeII(CN)(CO)2 Complex B from HydG to HydE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical SAM protein HydG uses L&#8208;tyrosine, L&#8208;cysteine and ferrous ion to produce complex B, which corresponds to a (&#954;3&#8208;cysteinate)Fe(CN)(CO)2, organometallic compound. Complex B is subsequently transferred through direct contacts to the radical SAM protein HydE for further processing en route to the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase H&#8208;cluster.







Abstract
[FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases efficiently catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen. Their prowess stems from the intricate H&#8208;cluster, combining a [Fe4S4] center with a binuclear iron center ([2Fe]H). In the latter, each iron atom is coordinated by a CO and CN ligand, connected by a CO and an azadithiolate ligand. The synthesis of this active site involves a unique multiprotein assembly, featuring radical SAM proteins HydG and HydE. HydG initiates the transformation of L&#8208;tyrosine into cyanide and carbon monoxide to generate complex B, which is subsequently transferred to HydE to continue the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H&#8208;subcluster. Due to its instability, complex B isolation for structural or spectroscopic characterization has been elusive thus far. Nevertheless, the use of a biomimetic analogue of complex B allowed circumvention of the need for the HydG protein during in vitro functional investigations, implying a similar structure for complex B. Herein, we used the HydE protein as a nanocage to encapsulate and stabilize the complex B product generated by HydG. Using X&#8208;ray crystallography, we successfully determined its structure at 1.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrated that complex B is directly transferred from HydG to HydE, thus not being released into the solution post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting a transient interaction between the two proteins.

         <title>Generation of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Radicals for Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in hydroamination, amidosulfenylation and bromoamination of unactivated alkenes. The resulting alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines serve as important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules. Experimental data on the mechanism are presented.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have been widely recognized as versatile synthetic intermediates for the construction of nitrogen containing molecules of high value. As such, there has been a long&#8208;standing interest in the field of organic synthesis to develop novel nitrogen&#8208;based radicals and explore their inherent reactivity. In this study, we present the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in a novel and diverse functionalization of unactivated alkenes. Bench&#8208;stable aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridinium salts were employed as crucial NCR precursors, which enabled the efficient conversion of various unactivated alkenes into medicinally relevant alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines. This approach offers an unexplored retrosynthetic disconnection for the synthesis of related molecules that commonly possess therapeutic value. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to the synthesis of densely functionalized heterocyclic amines by utilizing disulfides and diethyl bromomalonate as radical quenchers. Mechanistic investigations indicate an energy transfer (EnT) pathway involving the formation of a transient aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radical, radical addition to unactivated alkenes, and subsequent generation of the amination product through either hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or radical addition processes.

         <title>Small Organic Molecular Electrocatalysts for Fuels Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Minireview, recent efforts to develop electrocatalytic systems consisting of small organic molecules employed for energy relevant reactions such as water oxidation, hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are highlighted.







Abstract
In recent years, heterocyclic organic compounds have been explored as molecular electrocatalysts in relevant reactions for energy conversion and storage. Merging mimetics of biological systems that perform hydride transfer with rational synthetic chemical design has opened many opportunities for organic molecules to be tuned at the atomic level conferring them interesting reactivities. These molecular electrocatalysts represent an alternative to traditional metallic materials and metal complexes employed for water oxidation, hydrogen production, and carbon dioxide reduction. This minireview describes recent reports concerning design, catalytic activity and the mechanism of synthetic molecular electrocatalysts towards solar fuels production.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Conjugate&#8208;Based Pickering Emulsions for Cell&#8208;Free Expression and Cascade Biotransformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely conjugated enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugates serve as stabilizers to form Pickering emulsions. In the aqueous phase, enzymes can be expressed in vitro and directly used to construct multiple&#8208;step reactions with the biocatalysts prepositioned on the emulsion droplet surface. This approach integrates the strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient solution for chemical synthesis by cascade biotransformations.







Abstract
In this study, we addressed the limitations of conventional enzyme&#8208;polymer&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis, which traditionally suffer from nonspecific and uncontrollable conjugation positions that can impede catalytic performance. By introducing a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) at a specific site on target enzymes, we enabled precise polymer&#8208;enzyme conjugation. These engineered conjugates then acted as biocatalytically active emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions, while encapsulating a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) system in the aqueous phase for targeted enzyme expression. The resulting cascade reaction system leveraged enzymes expressed in the aqueous phase and on the emulsion interface for optimized chemical biosynthesis. The use of the cell&#8208;free system eliminated the need for intact whole cells or purified enzymes, representing a significant advancement in biocatalysis. Remarkably, the integration of Pickering emulsion, precise enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugation, and CFPS resulted in a fivefold enhancement in catalytic performance as compared to traditional single&#8208;phase reactions. Therefore, our approach harnesses the combined strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient and practical solution for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals in various biocatalysis and biotransformation applications.

         <title>Cesium Cyclopropane Acid&#8208;Aided Crystal Growth Enables Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Moisture Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (iHPs) are promising photovoltaic materials, the associated water sensitivity of iHPs calls for stringent humidity control to reach satisfactory photovoltaic efficiencies. Herein, we report a moisture&#8208;insensitive perovskite formation route under ambient air for CsPbI2Br&#8208;based iHPs via cesium cyclopropane acids (C3) as a compound introducer. With this approach, appreciably enhanced crystallization quality and moisture tolerance of CsPbI2Br are attained. The improvements are attributed to the modified evaporation enthalpy of the volatile side product of DMA&#8208;acid initiated by Cs&#8208;acids. As such, the water&#8208;involving reaction is directed toward the DMA&#8208;acids, leaving the target CsPbI2Br perovskites insensitive to ambient humidity. We highlight that by controlling the C3 concentration, the dependence of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in CsPbI2Br devices on the humidity level during perovskite film formation becomes favorably weakened, with the PCEs remaining relatively high (&gt;15%) associated with improved device stability for RH levels changed from 25% to 65%. The champion solar cells yield an impressive PCE exceeding 17%, showing small degradations (&lt;10%) for 2000 hours of shell storage and 300 hours of 85/85 (temperature/humidity) tests. The demonstrated C3&#8208;based strategy provides an enabler for improving the long&#8208;sought moisture&#8208;stability of iHPs toward high photovoltaic device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rigid Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Core Toward Stable Electroluminescence and Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic laser devices with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is emerging due to the potential of harnessing triplets. In this work, a boron/nitrogen multiple&#8208;resonance TADF polycyclic framework fusing carbazole units (CzBNPh) was proposed. CzBNPh exhibited a narrowband emission (&lt;30 nm), a unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and a fast radiative rate. Consequently, CzBNPh demonstrated a low distributed feedback (DFB) lasing threshold of 0.68 &#956;J cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the stimulated emission zone of CzBNPh was effectively separated from its singlet and triplet absorption, thereby minimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation under long&#8208;pulsed excitation ranging from 20 &#956;s to 2.5 ms. Significantly, the enhanced rigid molecular conformation, thermal stability, and photo&#8208;stability resulted in improved lasing and electroluminescence stability compared to that of 5,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene (DABNA)&#8208;core. These findings indicate the potential of CzBN&#8208;core as a promising framework for achieving long&#8208;pulsed wave and electrically&#8208;pumped lasing in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous&#160;Elimination of Excess Photoinstable PbI2 and Interfacial Band Mismatch for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eliminating&#160;the undesired photoinstability of excess lead iodide (PbI2) in the perovskite film and reducing the energy mismatch between the perovskite layer and heterogeneous interfaces are urgent issues to be addressed in the preparation of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by two&#8208;step sequential deposition method. Here, the&#160;1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) is employed to convert superfluous PbI2 to more robust 1D EMIMPbI3 which can withstand&#160;lattice strain, while forming an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface to reconfigure the interfacial energy band structure and accelerate the charge extraction. Consequently,&#160;the unencapsulated PVSCs device attains a champion efficiency of 24.28% with one of the highest open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.19 V).&#160;Moreover, the unencapsulated&#160;devices showcase significantly improved thermal stability, enhanced environmental stability and remarkable operational stability accompanied by 85% of primitive efficiency retained over 1500 h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd8 Nanocluster with Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;Metallo&#8208;Aromatic&#8208;Ring Coordination and Promising Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials with atomic precision and understanding their underlying stability mechanisms are challenging. Here, stable single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanoclusters of Pd were synthesized and precisely characterized through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. A pseudo&#8208;pentalene&#8208;like Pd8 unit was found in the nanocluster, interacting with two syn PPh units through nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metallo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring coordination. The unexpected coordination, which is distinctly different from the typical organo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination in half&#8208;sandwich&#8208;type organometallic compounds, contributes to the ambient stability of the as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanocluster as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations revealed dominant electron transition along the horizontal x&#8208;direction of the Pd8 plane, indicating high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the nanocluster, which was verified by the experimental PCE of 73.3%. Therefore, this study unveils the birth of a novel type of compound and the finding of the unusual nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metallo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring coordination and has important implications for future syntheses, structures, properties, and structure&#8211;property correlations of single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Exchangeable Self&#8208;Assembled Lanthanide Antennas for PLIM Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanides have unique photoluminescence (PL) emission properties, including very long PL lifetimes. This makes them ideal for biological imaging applications, especially using PL lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). PLIM is an inherently multidimensional technique with exceptional advantages for quantitative biological imaging. Unfortunately, due to the required prolonged acquisitions times, photobleaching of lanthanide PL emission currently constitutes one of the main drawbacks of PLIM. In this study, we report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble, lanthanide antenna, 8&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[de]quinoline&#8208;3phosphonic acid, PAnt, specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable dye aimed at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Thus, selfassembled lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during image acquisition are continuously replenished by intact lanthanide antennas from a large reservoir. Remarkably, our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex clearly demonstrated a significant reduction of PL photobleaching when compared to well&#8208;established lanthanide cryptates, used for bioimaging. This concept of exchangeable lanthanide antennas opens new possibilities for quantitative PLIM bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The controlled grafting of polymers from small&#8208; and macro&#8208;molecular substrates is an essential process for many advanced polymer applications. This usually requires the pre&#8208;functionalisation of substrates with an appropriate functional group, such as a RAFT agent or ATRP initiator, which requires additional synthetic steps. In this paper, we describe the direct grafting of RAFT polymers from carboxylate containing small molecules and polymers via photochemical radical decarboxylation. This method utilises the innate functional groups present in the substrates, and achieves efficient polymer initiation in a single step with excellent control of molecular weight and dispersity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic sp Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Polymers with Synergistic Multi&#8208;Active Groups for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green organic materials composed of C, H, O,&#160;and N elements are receiving more and more attention worldwide. However, the high solubility, poor electrical conductivity, and long activation time limit the development of organic materials in practice. Herein, two stable covalent organic materials with alkynyl linkage between benzene rings and benzothiadiazole groups with different amounts of fluorine atoms modification (defined as BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F), are designed for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Both BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F can achieve superior reversible capacities of ~719.8 and 713.5 mA h&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;over 100 cycles on account of the redox activity of alkynyl (two&#8208;electron involved) and benzothiadiazole units (five&#8208;electron involved) in these organic materials. While BOP&#8208;2F electrodes exhibit much more stable cycling performance than BOP&#8208;0F electrodes, especially without pronounced capacity ascending during initial cycling. It can be assigned to the synergy effect of alkynyl linkage and fluorine atom modification in BOP&#8208;2F. The lithium storage and activation mechanism&#160;of alkynyl, benzothiadiazole, and fluorine groups&#160;have also been deeply probed&#160;by a series of material characterizations&#160;and theoretical simulations.&#160;This work could be noteworthy in providing novel tactics for the molecular design and investigation of high&#8208;efficiency organic electrodes for energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Glucose Oxidase&#8208;Carbon Nanotube Conjugates for Tissue&#8208;Translatable Glucose Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous and non&#8208;invasive glucose monitoring and imaging is important for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management. However, glucose monitoring remains a technical challenge owing to the dearth of tissue&#8208;transparent glucose sensors. In this study, we present the development of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors directly functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx) capable of immediate and reversible glucose imaging in biological fluids and tissues. We prepared GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors by facile sonication of SWCNT with GOx in a manner that &#8211; surprisingly &#8211; does not compromise the ability of GOx to detect glucose. Importantly, we find by using denatured GOx that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the catalytic oxidation of glucose but rather triggered by glucose&#8208;GOx binding. Leveraging the unique response mechanism of GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors, we developed catalytically inactive apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT that enables both sensitive and reversible glucose imaging, exhibiting a &#916;F/F0 of up to 40 % within 1 s of exposure to glucose. We finally demonstrate the potential applicability of apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT in biomedical applications by glucose quantification in human plasma and glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.</dc:description>

         <title>Bent &#960;&#8208;Conjugation within a Macrocycle: Asymmetric Total Syntheses of Spirohexenolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles with bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation motif are extremely rare in nature and synthetically daunting and anticancer haouamines and spirohexenolides were representative of such rare natural products with synthetically challenging bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation within a macrocycle. While the total synthesis of haouamines has been elegantly achieved, spirohexenolides remains an unmet synthetic challenge due to the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within C15 macrocycle. Inspired by the chemical synthesis of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) and haouamines, herein we devise a synthetic strategy to overcome the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within the macrocycle and achieve the first, asymmetric total synthesis of spirohexenolides A (&gt;20 mg) and B (&gt;50 mg). Our synthesis features strategic design of ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) macrocyclization followed by double dehydration to achieve the C15 macrocycle with the deformed nonplanar 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation. In addition, we have developed a new enantioselective construction of highly functionalized spirotetronate fragment (northeast moiety) through RCM and Ireland&#8722;Claisen rearrangement. Our in vitro bioassay studies reveal that both spirohexenolides are cytotoxic against a panel of human cancer cells with IC50 1.2&#8208;13.3 &#956;M and spirohexenolide A is consistently more potent (up to 3 times) than spirohexenolide B, suggesting the importance of alcohol for their bioactivity and for medicinal chemistry development.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging the Proximity and Distribution of Cu&#8208;Cs Sites for Direct Conversion of Methanol to Esters/Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methanol serves as a versatile building&#8208;block for various commodity chemicals, and the development of industrially promising strategies for its conversion remains the ultimate goal in methanol chemistry.  In this study, we design a dual Cu&#8208;Cs catalytic system that enables a one&#8208;step direct conversion of methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol into high value&#8208;added esters/aldehydes, with customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8208;Cs sites. Cu&#8208;Cs at a millimeter&#8208;scale intimacy triggers methanol dehydrogenation and condensation, involving proton transfer, aldol formation, and aldol condensation, to obtain unsaturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 76.3% and 31.1%, respectively. Cu&#8208;Cs at a micrometer&#8208;scale intimacy significantly promotes mass transfer of intermediates across catalyst interfaces and their subsequent hydrogenation to saturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 67.6% and 93.1%, respectively. Conversely, Cu&#8208;Cs at a nanometer&#8208;scale intimacy alters reaction pathway with a similar energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step, but blocks the acidic&#8208;basic sites and diverts the reaction to byproducts. More importantly, an unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of methyl methacrylate (MMA) is achieved by further tailoring Cu and Cs distribution across the reaction bed in the configuration of Cu&#8208;Cs||Cs, outperforming the existing industrial processes and saving at least 15% of production costs.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring of Metal Complexes on Au25 Nanocluster for Enhanced Photocoupled Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) with discrete energy levels can be used as photosensitizers for CO2 reduction. However, tight ligand capping of Au NCs hinders CO2 adsorption on its active sites. Here, a new hybrid material is obtained by anchoring of thiol functionalized terpyridine metal complexes (metal complexes, metal= Ru, Ni, Fe, Co) on Au NCs by ligand exchange reactions (LERs). The anchoring of Ru and Ni complexes on Au25 NC (Au25&#8208;Ru and Au25&#8208;Ni) leads to adequate CO2 to CO conversion for photocoupled, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (PECR) in terms of high selectivity, with Faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) exceeding 90% in a wide potential range, remarkable activity (CO production rate up to two times higher than that for pristine Au25PET18) and extremely large turnover frequencies (TOFs, 63012 h&#8208;1 at &#8208;0.97 V for Au25&#8208;Ru and 69989 h&#8208;1 at &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE for Au25&#8208;Ni). Moreover, PECR stability test indicates the excellent long&#8208;term stability of the modified NCs in contrast with pristine Au NCs. The present approach offers a novel strategy to enhance PECR activity and selectivity, as well as to improve the stability of Au NCs under light illumination, which paves the way for highly active and stable Au NCs catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiplying Oxygen Permeability of a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Oxide by Orientation Control via Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;type oxides exhibit remarkable chemical stability in comparison to perovskite oxides. However, they display lower oxygen permeability. We present an approach to overcome this trade&#8208;off by leveraging the anisotropic properties of Nd2NiO4+&#948;. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field (0.81 T). A stable and high oxygen flux of 1.40 mL min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 was achieved for at least 120 h at 1223 K by a textured asymmetric disk membrane with 1.0 mm thickness under the pure CO2 sweeping. Its excellent operational stability was also verified even at 1023 K in pure CO2. These findings highlight the significant enhancement in oxygen permeation membrane performance achievable by adjusting the grain orientation. Consequently, Nd2NiO4+&#948; emerges as a promising candidate for industrial applications in air separation, syngas production, and CO2 capture under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully aromatic self&#8208;assembled hole&#8208;selective layer toward efficient inverted wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with ultraviolet resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet&#8208;induced degradation has emerged as a critical stability concern impeding the widespread adoption of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in the context of phase&#8208;unstable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films. This study introduces a novel approach by employing a fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;PhPACz), as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap PSCs. Incorporating a conjugated linker plays a pivotal role in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL on substrates, facilitating subsequent perovskite interfacial interactions, and fostering the growth of uniform perovskite films. The high&#8208;quality film could effectively suppress interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. Through these advancements, the optimized wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, featuring a bandgap of 1.68 eV, attain an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10%. Remarkably, MeO&#8208;PhPACz demonstrates inherent UV resistance and heightened UV absorption capabilities, resulting in a substantial improvement in UV resistance for the targeted PSCs. This characteristic holds significance for the feasibility of large&#8208;scale outdoor applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy To Access Alternating Styrene/Substituted Styrene Copolymers by Using a Traceless Controlling Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical alternating copolymerization has been realized between &#945;&#8208;styryl boronate pinacol ester and diverse styrene co&#8208;monomers. Facile removal of the traceless boronyl controlling group further provides a unified access to a wide range of alternating polystyrenes that are non&#8208;trivial to obtain through conventional approaches.







Abstract
We herein report a synthetic strategy for alternating copolymers of styrene and substituted styrenes by utilizing &#945;&#8208;styryl boronate pinacol ester (StBpin) as the co&#8208;monomer through radical alternating copolymerization followed by protodeboronation. The excellent alternating polymerization behavior of the StBpin co&#8208;monomer in such a radical polymerization system is considered to be attributed to the steric hindrance and radical stabilization exerted by the Bpin group. This strategy is effective with a wide range of substituted styrene co&#8208;monomers regardless of the electronic nature of the substituents, and the protodeboronation of the alternating Bpin&#8208;containing polymers is highly efficient without polymer backbone alternation. RAFT living polymerization was also compatible with this approach. Thus, this strategy provides a way to build&#8208;up alternating copolymers consisting of similar styrene&#8208;type co&#8208;monomers, which has been inaccessible by conventional synthetic methods.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenative Deuteration of Halides over a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework MFM&#8208;300(Cr) acts as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenative deuteration of both arylhalides and alkylhalides (40 substrates) with high deuterium incorporation. Synchrotron PXRD reveals the activation of halogenated substrates via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). In situ EPR spectroscopy confirms the formation of carbon&#8208;based radicals as intermediates and reveals the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Deuterium labelling of organic compounds is an important process in chemistry. We report the first example of photocatalytic dehalogenative deuteration of both arylhalides and alkylhalides (40 substrates) over a metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;300(Cr), using CD3CN as the deuterium source at room temperature. MFM&#8208;300(Cr) catalyses high deuterium incorporation and shows excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the activation of halogenated substrates via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). In situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirms the formation of carbon&#8208;based radicals as intermediates and reveals the reaction pathway. This protocol removes the use of precious&#8208;metal catalysts from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art processes based upon direct hydrogen isotope exchange and shows high photocatalytic stability, thus enabling multiple catalytic cycles.

         <title>Multiple Triplet Metal&#8208;Centered Jahn&#8208;Teller Isomers Determine Temperature&#8208;Dependent Luminescence Lifetimes in [Ru(bpy)3]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ are in excellent agreement with experimental values only when multiple pathways involving Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers of the 3MC excited states are considered.







Abstract
Understanding the factors that determine the luminescence lifetime of transition metal compounds is key for applications in photocatalysis and photodynamic therapy. Here we show that for 
(bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), the generally accepted idea that emission lifetimes can be controlled optimizing the energy barrier from the emissive triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) state to the thermally&#8208;activated triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state or the energy gap between both states is a misconception. Further, we demonstrate that considering a single relaxation pathway determined from the minimum that is lowest in energy leads to wrong temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes predictions. Instead, we obtain excellent agreement with experimental temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes when an extended kinetic model that includes all the pathways related to multiple Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers and their effective reaction barriers is employed. These concepts are essential to correctly design other luminescent transition metal complexes with tailored emission lifetimes based on theoretical predictions.

         <title>Photoinduced [3+2] Cycloaddition of Carbenes and Nitriles: A Versatile Approach to Oxazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing singlet carbenes, we developed a versatile method for [3+2] cycloaddition with diverse nitriles to yield substituted oxazoles. Our approach can be extended to bis&#8208;oxazoles, isotope&#8208;labeled oxazoles, drug diversification, as well as natural product and drug synthesis. Integration of photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry demonstrated applicability, scalability, and robustness for oxazole synthesis.







Abstract
We have developed a photoinduced protocol for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important oxazole molecules using diazo&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;containing reactants. The process involves the initial photolysis of the diazo compound to afford singlet carbenes, which are tapped by nitriles in a [3+2] cycloaddition fashion to give substituted oxazoles. With di&#8208;nitrile compounds, useful bis&#8208;oxazoles were obtained. The applicability of the transformation is showcased through the expedient synthesis of small&#8208;molecule drugs and biologically relevant molecules such as felbinac, pimprinine, texamine, ugnenenazole etc. The protocol is also useful for the generation of 2H and 13C isotope labelled oxazoles. Merging photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry was demonstrated for scaling up the reaction. The non&#8208;requirement of metal catalysis or photosensitizers to harness the light energy with blue light sufficing the execution of the reaction makes it a versatile and general protocol for the synthesis of structurally diverse oxazoles

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Polymer for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion and Zinc Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal molecular engineering strategy is developed to enhance electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene to modulate the electronic state of metal centers. The resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone shows a much higher ammonia FE of 97.7&#8201;% than copper 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (85.1&#8201;%). It can be also applied as the catalyst cathode for rechargeable Zn&#8208;nitrate battery.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based materials are promising single&#8208;site catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) on account of well&#8208;defined structures and functional tunability but still lack a molecular&#8208;level understanding for designing the high&#8208;efficient catalysts. Here, we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to enhance electrochemical NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (BTA) based metal&#8208;organic polymer to precisely modulate the electronic state of metal centers. Due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the carbonyl group, metal centers can be converted to an electron&#8208;deficient state, fascinating the NO3&#8722; adsorption and promoting continuous hydrogenation reactions to produce NH3. Compared to CuBTA with a low NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion efficiency of 85.1&#8201;%, quinone group functionalization endows the resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone (CuTABQ) distinguished performance with a much higher NH3 FE of 97.7&#8201;%. This molecular engineering strategy is also universal, as verified by the improved NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion performance on different metal centers, including Co and Ni. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery based on CuTABQ cathode can deliver a high power density of 12.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides advanced insights into the rational design of metal complex catalysts through the molecular&#8208;level regulation for NO3&#8722; electroreduction to value&#8208;added NH3.

&lt;p&gt;A universal molecular engineering strategy is developed to enhance electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene to modulate the electronic state of metal centers. The resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone shows a much higher ammonia FE of 97.7&#8201;% than copper 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene (85.1&#8201;%).

         <title>Ultrafast Xanthate&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast photoiniferter polymerization was explored as a strategy to produce nano&#8208;objects via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. By leveraging the rapid photolysis of xanthates under UV light, micelles, worms, and vesicles could be produced within 5&#8197;min by varying core&#8208;chain length, concentration, or molar composition. Utilizing this technique, we developed a 25&#8197;g&#8208;scale one&#8208;pot method in which micelles were obtained within 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful technique for preparing block copolymer nanostructures. Recently, efforts have been focused on applying photochemistry to promote PISA due to the mild reaction conditions, low cost, and spatiotemporal control that light confers. Despite these advantages, chain&#8208;end degradation and long reaction times can mar the efficacy of this process. Herein, we demonstrate the use of ultrafast photoiniferter PISA to produce polymeric nanostructures. By exploiting the rapid photolysis of xanthates, near&#8208;quantitative monomer conversion can be achieved within five minutes to prepare micelles, worms, and vesicles at various core&#8208;chain lengths, concentrations, or molar compositions.

         <title>Synthetic Matching of Complex Monoterpene Indole Alkaloid Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of monoterpene indole alkaloid natural products have been subjected to chemical evolution to afford a collection of pseudo&#8208;natural products. The novel structural classes match the unique chemical space that is highlighted by the high spatial complexity&#8208;density of the parent natural product class and are enriched with bioactivities inhibiting DNA synthesis and tubulin polymerization.







Abstract
Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are endowed with high structural and spatial complexity and characterized by diverse biological activities. Given this complexity&#8208;activity combination in MIAs, rapid and efficient access to chemical matter related to and with complexity similar to these alkaloids would be highly desirable, since such compound classes might display novel bioactivity. We describe the design and synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) collection obtained by the unprecedented combination of MIA fragments through complexity&#8208;generating transformations, resulting in arrangements not currently accessible by biosynthetic pathways. Cheminformatic analyses revealed that both the pseudo&#8208;NPs and the MIAs reside in a unique and common area of chemical space with high spatial complexity&#8208;density that is only sparsely populated by other natural products and drugs. Investigation of bioactivity guided by morphological profiling identified pseudo&#8208;NPs that inhibit DNA synthesis and modulate tubulin. These results demonstrate that the pseudo&#8208;NP collection occupies similar biologically relevant chemical space that Nature has endowed MIAs with.

         <title>Retrosynthetic Analysis Applied to Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis of Four Rh(II)&#8208;Based Complexes as Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Clip&#8208;off Chemistry, a retrosynthetic analysis step based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds enables defining the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this new approach is used to synthesize four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.







Abstract
Clip&#8208;off Chemistry is a synthetic strategy that our group previously developed to obtain new molecules and materials through selective cleavage of bonds. Herein, we report recent work to expand Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by introducing into it a retrosynthetic analysis step that, based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds, enables one to define the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we have validated our new approach by synthesising and characterising four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.

         <title>Selective Four&#8208;Electron Reduction of Oxygen by a Nonheme Heterobimetallic CuFe Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
We report herein the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst ([CuII(bpbp)(&#956;&#8208;OAc)2FeIII]2+, CuFe&#8722;OAc), which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase and can catalyze oxygen reduction to water with a turnover frequency of 2.4&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1 and selectivity of 96.0&#8201;% in the presence of Et3NH+. This performance significantly outcompetes its homobimetallic analogues (2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1 of CuCu&#8722;OAc with %H2O2 selectivity of 98.9&#8201;%, and inactive of FeFe&#8722;OAc) under the same conditions. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, in combination with density functional theory calculation, show that the CuFe center efficiently mediates O&#8722;O bond cleavage via a CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII peroxo intermediate in which the peroxo ligand possesses distinctive coordinating and electronic character. Our work sheds light on the nature of Cu/Fe heterobimetallic cooperation in oxygen reduction catalysis and demonstrates the potential of this synergistic effect in the design of nonheme oxygen reduction catalysts.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Photocatalytic Decaging for Remote&#8208;Controlled Spatiotemporal Activation in Living Mice
</title>

         <dc:description>
Remote&#8208;controlled manipulation of biological processes is meaningful but challenging. Herein we report the development of near infrared light photocatalytic decaging chemistry (CAT&#8208;NIR) for on&#8208;demand fluorescence activation and drug release in living cells. We also achieved protein rescue and in vivo prodrug activation by taking advantage of the decaging chemistry and the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of the NIR light.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal manipulation of biological processes in living animals using noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled stimuli is a captivating but challenging endeavor. Herein, we present the development of a biocompatible photocatalytic technology termed CAT&#8208;NIR, which uses external near infrared light (NIR, 740&#8197;nm) to trigger decaging reactions in living mice. The Os(II) terpyridine complex was identified as an efficient NIR photocatalyst for promoting deboronative hydroxylation reactions via superoxide generation in the presence of NIR light, resulting in the deprotection of phenol groups and the release of bioactive molecules under living conditions. The validation of the CAT&#8208;NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR&#8208;triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer&#8208;aided screening, CAT&#8208;NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled rescue of drug molecules. Given its broad adaptability, this CAT&#8208;NIR system may open new opportunities for manipulating the functions of bioactive molecules in living animals using external NIR light with spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Diarylamines through a Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization Strategy
</title>

Novel amino&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts were obtained through SNAr with o&#8208;fluoro&#8208;diaryliodonium salts. A sequential arylation/ring opening pathway with external nucleophiles allows for transition metal&#8208;free skeletal diversification of cyclic amines to provide a wide variety of complex diarylamines with high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. The strategy proved efficient also in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
The diarylation and skeletal diversification of unstrained cyclic amines was exploited to expand and modify the favorable properties of this important substrate class with pivotal roles in drug discovery. Cyclic amines were employed in the synthesis of a novel class of amino&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts, which were converted to highly functionalized diarylamines through an atom&#8208;efficient one&#8208;pot N&#8208;arylation/ring opening reaction with external nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds through in situ formation of a diarylammonium intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic ring opening by cleavage of the strong C&#8722;N bond. A wide variety of diarylamines was obtained through introduction of two different aryl groups of varied electronics, and the retained iodo&#8208;substituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group tolerance, and the strategy proved efficient also in in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Cyanines: Ultrabright Cyanine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Materials in Solution and in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular approach has been developed to inhibit the undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of cyanine dyes. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, the resulting supra&#8208;cyanines exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in both solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
Fluorescent materials with high brightness play a crucial role in the advancement of various technologies such as bioimaging, photonics, and OLEDs. While significant efforts are dedicated to designing new organic dyes with improved performance, enhancing the brightness of existing dyes holds equal importance. In this study, we present a simple supramolecular strategy to develop ultrabright cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent materials by addressing long&#8208;standing challenges associated with cyanine dyes, including undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Supra&#8208;cyanines are obtained by incorporating cyanine moieties in a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, and exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 50&#8201;%) in both solution and in the solid state. These findings offer a versatile approach for constructing highly emissive cyanine&#8208;based supramolecular materials.

         <title>Mechanical Effects of Elastic Crystals Driven by Natural Sunlight and Force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barbiturate&#8208;derived elastic crystal (BPDT) driven by natural sunlight and mechanical forces was constructed. The crystal showed backlight plastic bending properties under natural sunlight irradiation. Moreover, the crystal has great potential for application in robotic arms.







Abstract
Flexible crystals that can capture solar energy and convert it into mechanical energy are promising for a wide range of applications such as information storage and actuators, but obtaining them remains a challenge. Herein, an elastic crystal of a barbiturate derivative was found to be an excellent candidate, demonstrating plastic bending behavior under natural sunlight irradiation. 1H NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum data of microcrystals before and after light irradiation demonstrated that light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition was the driving force for the photomechanical effects. Interestingly, the crystals retained elastic bending even after light irradiation. This is the first report of flexible crystals that can be driven by natural sunlight and that have both photomechanical properties and elasticity. Furthermore, regulation of the passive light output direction of the crystals and transport of objects by applying mechanical forces and light was demonstrated.

This is the first report of flexible crystals that can be driven by natural sunlight and that have both photomechanical properties and elasticity. Furthermore, regulation of the passive light output direction of the crystals and transport of objects by applying mechanical forces and light was demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive Catalysts for the Selective Hydrogenation of Bicyclic Heteroaromatics using Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a CO2&#8208;Responsive Support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium nanoparticles immobilized on an amine&#8208;functionalized polymer&#8208;grafted silica material act as adaptive catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives, producing partially saturated products under H2/CO2, and fully saturated products under H2. The selectivity switch is reversible, rapid, and robust, and originates from the formation of ammonium formate species under H2/CO2, and their decomposition under H2.







Abstract
Ruthenium nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on an amine&#8208;functionalized polymer&#8208;grafted silica support act as adaptive catalysts for the hydrogenation of bicyclic heteroaromatics. Whereas full hydrogenation of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives is achieved under pure H2, introducing CO2 into the H2 gas phase leads to an effective shutdown of the arene hydrogenation while preserving the activity for the hydrogenation of the heteroaromatic part. The selectivity switch originates from the generation of ammonium formate species on the surface of the materials by catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The CO2 hydrogenation is fully reversible, resulting in a robust and rapid switch between the two states of the catalyst adapting its performance in response to the feed gas composition. A variety of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives were hydrogenated to fully or partially saturated products in high selectivity and yields simply by altering the composition of the feed gas from H2 to H2/CO2. The adaptive catalytic system thus provides controlled access to valuable products using a single catalyst rather than two specific and distinct catalysts with static reactivity.

         <title>A Photo&#8208; and Thermo&#8208;Driven Azoarene&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Molecular Switch in a Liquid Crystal Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;driven azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch has been designed. Reversible modulation of the polarization inversion and on&#8208;off&#8208;switchable circularly polarized luminescence in a helical superstructure have also been demonstrated.







Abstract
The development of chiral optical active materials with switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals remains a challenge. Here an azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch, (S, R, S)&#8208;switch 1 and (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, are designed and prepared with an (R)&#8208;binaphthyl azo group as a chiral photosensitive moiety and two (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;binaphthyl fluorescent molecules with opposite or the same handedness as chiral fluorescent moieties. Both switches exhibit reversible trans/cis isomerization when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light and 520&#8197;nm green light in solvent and liquid crystal (LC) media. In contrast with the control (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, when switch 1 is doped into nematic LCs, polarization inversion and switching&#8208;off of the CPL signals are achieved in the resultant helical superstructure upon irradiation with 365&#8197;nm UV and 520&#8197;nm green light, respectively. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the system is basically unchanged during this switching process. In particular, these variations of the CPL signals could be recovered after heating, realizing the true sense of CPL reversible switching. Taking advantage of the unique CPL switching, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for &#8220;a dual&#8208;optical information encryption system&#8221; based on the above CPL active material is demonstrated.

         <title>Nitrite and Nitric Oxide Interconversion at Mononuclear Copper(II): Insight into the Role of the Red Copper Site in Denitrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent geometric preference on the bidirectional reactivity of NOx at mononuclear copper(II) sites was investigated. The involvement of the same copper(II) coordination motif in both nitrite reductase (NIR) and nitric oxide oxidase (NOO) activities provides insight into the functional roles of unusual red copper protein in interconverting nitrite and NO.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) and nitric oxide (NO) interconversion is crucial for maintaining optimum NO flux in mammalian physiology. Herein we demonstrate that [L2CuII(nitrite)]+ moieties (in 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b; where, L&#8201;=&#8201;Me2PzPy and Me2PzQu) with distorted octahedral geometry undergo facile reduction to provide tetrahedral [L2CuI]+ (in 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) and NO in the presence of biologically relevant reductants, such as 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (4&#8208;MeO&#8208;2,6&#8208;DTBP, a tyrosine model) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH, a NAD(P)H model). Interestingly, the reaction of excess NO gas with [L2CuII(MeCN)2]2+ (in 1&#8201;a) provides a putative {CuNO}10 species, which is effective in mediating the nitrosation of various nucleophiles, such as thiol and amine. Generation of the transient {CuNO}10 species in wet acetonitrile leads to NO2&#8722; as assessed by Griess assay and 14N/15N&#8208;FTIR analyses. A detailed study reveals that the bidirectional NOx&#8208;reactivity, namely, nitrite reductase (NIR) and NO oxidase (NOO), at a common CuII site, is governed by the geometric&#8208;preference&#8208;driven facile CuII/CuI redox process. Of broader interest, this study not only highlights potential strategies for the design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for nitrite reduction, but also strengthens the previous postulates regarding the involvement of red copper proteins in denitrification.

         <title>Selectivity Control in the Direct CO Esterification over Pd@UiO&#8208;66: The Pd Location Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Pd nanoparticles into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibits high selectivity for dimethyl carbonate (DMC), while Pd nanoparticles on MOFs and other supports give high selectivity for dimethyl oxalate (DMO) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite. The Lewis acid microenvironment surrounding Pd NPs is responsible for the reversed product selectivity.







Abstract
The selectivity control of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite toward dimethyl oxalate (DMO) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC) remains a grand challenge. Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X=&#8208;H, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;NH2), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO&#8208;66, displays high selectivity (89&#8201;%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.

Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO-66-X (X=-H, -NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), affording Pd@UiO-66-X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO-66, displays high selectivity (89&#8201;%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO-66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr-oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO-66 and Pd/UiO-66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Synthesis of a Multiple D&#8211;A Conjugated Macrocycle and Its Application in Organic Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple D&#8211;A ring&#8208;like conjugated molecule, RCM was synthesized via a template&#8208;directed process. RCM inherits the superior photovoltaic properties characteristic of D&#8211;A linear molecules, including a narrow optical gap and effective charge transfer. Importantly, RCM demonstrates reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, attributable to its minimized vibration.







Abstract
As a novel class of materials, D&#8211;A conjugated macrocycles hold significant promise for chemical science. However, their potential in photovoltaic remains largely untapped due to the complexity of introducing multiple donor and acceptor moieties into the design and synthesis of cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Here, we report a multiple D&#8211;A ring&#8208;like conjugated molecule (RCM) via the coupling of dimer molecule DBTP&#8208;C3 as a template and thiophenes in high yields. RCM exhibits a narrow optical gap (1.33&#8197;eV) and excellent thermal stability, and shows a remarkable photoluminescence yield (&#934;PL) of 11.1&#8201;% in solution, much higher than non&#8208;cyclic analogues. Organic solar cell (OSC) constructed with RCM as electron acceptor shows efficient charge separation at donor&#8208;acceptor band offsets and achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2&#8201;%&#8208;approximately fourfold higher than macrocycle&#8208;based OSCs reported so far. This is partly due to low non&#8208;radiative voltage loss down to 0.20&#8197;eV and a high electroluminescence yield (&#934;EL) of 4&#215;10&#8722;4. Our findings emphasize the potential of D&#8211;A cyclic conjugated molecules in advancing organic photovoltaic technology.

         <title>Azoxy Compounds&#8212;From Synthesis to Reagents for Azoxy Group Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein is the synthesis of sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds from nitroso arenes and iminoiodinanes by using visible light irradiation. The bench&#8208;stable sulfonyl azoxy compounds can be used in azoxy group transfer reactions for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ether molecules and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
The azoxy functional group is an important structural motif and represents the formally oxidized counterpart of the azo group. Azoxy compounds find numerous applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to functional materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped with a main focus on the formation symmetric azoxy compounds. To overcome challenges in the synthesis of such unsymmetric azoxy compounds, we designed a process employing readily accessible nitroso compounds and iminoiodinanes. This method builds on the use of visible light irradiation to generate a triplet nitrene from iminoiodinanes, which is trapped by nitroso arenes to give access to sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds with a good substrate scope and functional group tolerance. We further describe two applications of these sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds as radical precursors in synthesis, where the whole azoxy group can be transferred and employed in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ethers or 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers. All of the reactions occurred at room temperature under visible light irradiation without the addition of any photoredox catalysts and additives. Control experiments, mechanism investigations, and DFT studies well explained the observed reactivity.

         <title>Chemoselective Quinoline and Isoquinoline Reduction by Energy Transfer Catalysis Enabled Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkene and a (hetero)arene, to be reduced or retained? In contrast to conventional processes, in the reported hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) protocol enabled by energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, the benzenoid ring of a quinoline is more easily reduced than an electron&#8208;deficient alkene. Furthermore, many reducing labile moieties, such as aryl iodides, electron&#8208;deficient alkynes, benzsulfamides, and benzyl ethers, are compatible with this method.







Abstract
(Hetero)arene reduction is one of the key avenues for synthesizing related cyclic alkenes and alkanes. While catalytic hydrogenation and Birch reduction are the two broadly utilized approaches for (hetero)arene reduction across academia and industry over the last century, both methods have encountered significant chemoselectivity challenges. We hereby introduce a highly chemoselective quinoline and isoquinoline reduction protocol operating through selective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, which enables subsequent hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The design of this protocol bypasses the conventional metric of reduction reaction, that is, the reductive potential, and instead relies on the triplet energies of the chemical moieties and the kinetic barriers of energy and hydrogen atom transfer events. Many reducing labile functional groups, which were incompatible with previous (hetero)arene reduction reactions, are retained in this reaction. We anticipate that this protocol will trigger the further advancement of chemoselective arene reduction and enable the current arene&#8208;rich drug space to escape from flatland.

         <title>Densely Packed CO2 Aids Charge, Spin, and Lattice Ordering Partially Fluctuated in a Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic phase transition temperature increased from 65 to 100&#8197;K via CO2 adsorption in a two&#8208;dimensional layered magnet composed of a paddlewheel&#8208;type diruthenium unit and TCNQ derivatives because of the suppression of charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure upon CO2 accommodation.







Abstract
Partial charge fluctuations in the charge&#8208;ordered state of a material, often triggered by structural disorders and/or defects, can significantly alter its physical characteristics, such as magnetic long&#8208;range ordering. However, it is difficult to post&#8208;chemically fix such accidental partial fluctuations to reconstruct a uniform charge&#8208;ordered state. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;aided charge ordering demonstrated in a CO2&#8208;post&#8208;captured layered magnet, [{Ru2(o&#8208;ClPhCO2)4}2{TCNQ(OMe)2}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CO2 (1&#8835;CO2; o&#8208;ClPhCO2&#8722;=ortho&#8208;chlorobenzoate; TNCQ(OMe)2=2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane). Pristine porous layered magnet 1 had a partially charge&#8208;fluctuated ordered state, which provided ferrimagnetic ordering at TC=65&#8197;K. Upon loading CO2, 1 adsorbed one mole of CO2, forming 1&#8835;CO2, and raising TC to 100&#8197;K. This was because of the vanishing charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure. This research illustrates the post&#8208;accessible host&#8211;guest chemistry delicately combined with charge, spin, and lattice ordering in a spongy magnet. Furthermore, it highlights how this innovative approach opens up new possibilities for technology and nanoscale magnetism manipulation.

         <title>Alignment of Heptagonal Diimide and Triazine Enables Narrowband Pure&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have created an efficient sky&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer by aligning heptagonal diimide and triazine acceptors. This innovative hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy has enabled us to fabricate narrowband pure&#8208;blue TADF sensitized fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) with a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2.







Abstract
The endeavor to develop high&#8208;performance narrowband blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with low efficiency roll&#8208;off represents an attractive challenge. Herein, we introduce a hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy centered around the heptagonal diimide (BPI) building block to create an efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer. The alignment of a twisted BPI unit and a planar diphenyltriazine (TRZ) fragment imparts remarkable exciton dynamic properties to 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI, including a fast radiative decay rate (kR) of 1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a swift reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.8&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, complemented by a slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate (kNR) of 6.0&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1. Consequently, 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI facilitates the fabrication of high&#8208;performance narrowband pure&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.3&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off even at a high brightness level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2 (EQE10000: 16.8&#8201;%). This showcases a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2 for narrowband blue TSF&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Binary Silicon&#8208;Centered Organoboron Catalyst with Superior Performance to That of Its Bifunctional Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In general, two&#8208;component catalysts containing Lewis pairs are inferior to one&#8208;component ones due to the lack of intramolecular synergy. A silicon&#8208;centered bimolecular catalyst has been developed that exhibits a rare higher activity than its unimolecular analogue, even at low loadings. A unique two&#8208;path initiation mode was proposed to explain its exceptional catalytic performance in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide.







Abstract
This work reported that a silicon&#8208;centered alkyl borane/ammonium salt binary (two&#8208;component) catalyst exhibits much higher activity than its bifunctional analogue (one&#8208;component) for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide, showing 7.3&#8197;times the activity of its bifunctional analogue at a low catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, and even 15.3&#8197;times the activity at an extremely low loading of 0.002&#8197;mol&#8201;%. By using 19F NMR spectroscopy, control experiments, and theoretical calculation we discovered that the central silicon atom displays appropriate electron density and a larger intramolecular cavity, which is useful to co&#8208;activate the monomer and to deliver propagating chains, thus leading to a better intramolecular synergic effect than its bifunctional analogue. A unique two&#8208;pathway initiation mode was proposed to explain the unusual high activity of the binary catalytic system. This study breaks the traditional impression of the binary Lewis acid/nucleophilic catalyst with poor activity because of the increase in entropy.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polyborosiloxanes: Non&#8208;traditional Luminescent Polymers with Red Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>

The synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions has been used to construct non&#8208;traditional fluorescence polymers with long emission wavelengths and fluorescence lifetimes. This has led to a hyperbranched polyborosiloxane that exhibits red emission at 640&#8197;nm and delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s.







Abstract
Non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers have attracted significant attention for their excellent biocompatibility and diverse applications. However, designing and preparing non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers that simultaneously possess long emission wavelengths and long fluorescence lifetime remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes (P1&#8211;P4) were synthesized. As the electron density increases on the monomer diol, the optimal emission wavelengths of the P1&#8211;P4 polymers gradually red&#8208;shift to 510, 570, 575, and 640&#8197;nm, respectively. In particular, P4 not only exhibits red emission but also demonstrates delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s and the lowest critical cluster concentration (1.76&#8197;mg/mL). The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction was the key factor contributing to the red&#8208;light emission with delayed fluorescence. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in dual&#8208;information encryption. This study provides a universal design strategy for the development of unconventional fluorescent polymers with both delayed fluorescence and long&#8208;wavelength emission.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Product Observation for CO2 Electroreduction Using Synchronised Electrochemistry&#8208;Mass Spectrometry with Soft Ionisation (sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI)</title>

         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) products is unambiguously elucidated with high temporal resolution using the synchronised electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry with soft ionisation (sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI), where CO species can be detected without the interference of CO2 fragmentation, providing insights about the reaction mechanism and kinetics for CO2RR.







Abstract
The mechanistic understanding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a rapid and accurate characterisation of product distribution to unravel the activity and selectivity, which is yet hampered by the lack of advanced correlative approaches. Here, we present the time&#8208;resolved identification of CO2RR products by using the synchronised electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry (sEC&#8208;MS). Transients in product formation can be readily captured in relation to electrochemical conditions. Moreover, a soft ionisation (SI) strategy is developed in MS for the direct observation of CO, immune to the interference of CO2 fragments. With the sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI, the kinetic information, such as Tafel slopes and onset potentials, for a myriad of CO2RR products are revealed and we show the hysteresis seen for the evolution of some species may originate from the potential&#8208;driven changes in surface coverage of intermediates. This work provides a real&#8208;time picture of the dynamic formation of CO2RR products.

         <title>Neuroprotective Bioorthogonal Catalysis in Mitochondria Using Protein&#8208;Integrated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic self&#8208;assembly of proteins with hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) endowed with catalytic activity led to biocomposites that acted as bioorthogonal chemical catalysts to generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and enzymatic catalysts to decompose hydrogen peroxide. The nanoscale biocomposites were specifically targeted to mitochondria for neuroprotection, thus showing how HOFs can be leveraged for targeted therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis holds promise for controlling cell function precisely, yet achieving selective and efficient chemical reactions within organelles is challenging. In this study, we introduce a new strategy using protein&#8208;integrated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to enable synergistic bioorthogonal chemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis within mitochondria. Utilizing catalytically active tris(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylicacid&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) to self&#8208;assemble with [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biscarboximidamide, we synthesized nanoscale RuB&#8208;HOFs that exhibit high photocatalytic reduction activity. Notably, RuB&#8208;HOFs efficiently enter cells and preferentially localize to mitochondria, where they facilitate bioorthogonal photoreduction reactions. Moreover, we show that RuB&#8208;HOFs encapsulating catalase can produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in mitochondria through photocatalytic reduction of pro&#8208;H2S and degrade hydrogen peroxide through enzymatic catalysis simultaneously, offering a significant neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress. Our findings not only introduce a versatile chemical toolset for mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis for prodrug activation but also pave the way for potential therapeutic applications in treating diseases related to cellular oxidative stress.

         <title>Advanced Lithium Extraction Membranes Derived from Tagged&#8208;Modification of Polyamide Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tagged&#8208;modification approach has been developed to selectively modify the top and bottom parts of a polyamide membrane, thereby resulting in the highest current Mg2+/Li+ separation performance that is stable over a 30&#8208;day test. A large&#8208;area (0.24&#8197;m2) membrane was prepared and made into spiral&#8208;wound modules, which show high efficacy in extracting lithium from simulated brines.







Abstract
Efficient Mg2+/Li+ separation is crucial to combating the lithium shortage worldwide, yet current nanofiltration membranes suffer from low efficacy and/or poor scalability, because desirable properties of membranes are entangled and there is a trade&#8208;off. This work reports a &#8220;tagged&#8208;modification&#8221; approach to tackle the challenge. A mixture of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;trimethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium bromide (E1) and 3&#8208;aminopropyltrimethylazanium (E2) was designed to modify polyethylenimine &#8211; trimesoyl chloride (PEI&#8208;TMC) membranes. E1 and E2 reacted with the PEI and TMC, respectively, and thus, the membrane properties (hydrophilicity, pore sizes, charge) were untangled and intensified simultaneously. The permeance (34.3&#8197;L m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1) and Mg2+/Li+ selectivity (23.2) of the modified membranes are about 4&#8197;times and 2&#8197;times higher than the pristine membrane, and they remain stable in a 30&#8208;days test. The permeance is the highest among all analogous nanofiltration membranes. The tagged&#8208;modification method enables the preparation of large&#8208;area membranes and modules that produce high&#8208;purity lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) from simulated brine.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Modulated Facet&#8208;selective Charge Separation in Bi4NbO8Cl Single Crystal for Boosting Visible&#8208;light Driven Bifunctional Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive charge transfer channels were constructed by collaborating with the modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, which strengthens the facet&#8208;selective charge separation in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets for boosting visible&#8208;light driven bifunctional water splitting for H2 and O2 evolution.







Abstract
Developing bifunctional water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts is meaningful, but challenged by the harsh requirements of specific&#8208;facet single crystals with spatially separated reactive sites and anisotropic charge transfer paths contributed by well&#8208;built charge driving force. Herein, tunable ferroelectric polarization is introduced in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets to strengthen the orthogonal charge transfer channels. By manipulating the in&#8208;plane polarization from octahedral off&#8208;centering of Nb5+ and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization from lone pair electron effect of anisotropic Bi3+, both the fast charge recombination in bulk catalyst and the process of charge trapping into surface states can be effectively modulated. Collaborating with modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, cooperative charge tractive force is constructed, which reinforces the spatial separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to {110} reductive site facet and {001} oxidation site facet, respectively. While excessive polarization charges impair the facet&#8208;selective charge separation characteristics and conversely promote charge recombination on the surface. As a result, polarity&#8208;optimized Bi4NbO8Cl shows an excellent H2 and O2 evolution rate of 54.21 and 36.08&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. This work unveils the function of ferroelectric polarization in tuning the intrinsic facet&#8208;selective charge transfer process of photocatalysts.

         <title>Evoking Ferroptosis by Synergistic Enhancement of a Cyclopentadienyl Iridium&#8208;Betulin Immune Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy was used to develop an immune agonist Ir&#8208;Bet composed of an iridium complex fused with the natural product Betulin, which induced ferritinophagy&#8208;enhanced ferroptosis to activate antitumor immunity. The MLSE strategy not only promotes effective ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD), but also provides a new mechanism of action for metal&#8208;based anticancer complexes for cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) with the potential for antitumor immunity activation. In this study, a nonferrous cyclopentadienyl metal&#8208;based ferroptosis inducer [Ir(Cp*)(Bet)Cl]Cl (Ir&#8208;Bet) was developed by a metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy involving the reaction of [Ir(Cp*)Cl]2Cl2 with the natural product Betulin. The fusion of Betulin with iridium cyclopentadienyl (Ir&#8208;Cp*) species as Ir&#8208;Bet not only tremendously enhanced the antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells, but also activated ferritinophagy for iron homeostasis regulation by PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade inhibition with a lower dosage of Betulin, and then evoked an immune response by nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) activation of Ir&#8208;Cp* species. Further immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurred by remarkable ferroptosis through glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deactivation and ferritinophagy. An in vivo vaccination experiment demonstrated desirable antitumor and immunogenic effects of Ir&#8208;Bet by increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)/regulatory T cells (Tregs).

         <title>Guaiacol as an Organic Superoxide Dismutase Mimics for Anti&#8208;ageing a Ru&#8208;based Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>

         <dc:description>
Guaiacol as an organic superoxide dismutase mimics scavenged superoxide radicals via disproportionation by chelating lithium superoxide on its two functional groups. Additionally, guaiacol formed homogeneously thin polymeric cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability. Resultantly, guaiacol successfully anti&#8208;aged lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich layered oxides using oxygen redox as well as transition metal redox suffer from its structural instability due to lattice oxygen escaped from its structure during oxygen redox and the following electrolyte decomposition by the reactive oxygen species. Herein, we rescued a Li&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal by employing an organic superoxide dismutase mimics as a homogeneous electrolyte additive. Guaiacol scavenged superoxide radicals via dismutation or disproportionation to convert two superoxide molecules to peroxide and dioxygen after absorbing lithium superoxide on its partially negative oxygen of methoxy and hydroxyl groups. Additionally, guaiacol was decomposed to form a thin and stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability.

         <title>A Heterometallic Porphyrin Dimer as a Potential Quantum Gate: Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations and Spin Coherence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows that a vanadyl&#8208;copper meso&#8208;meso linked bisporphyrin complex has good spin coherence and a sizeable magnetic exchange interaction, making it suitable for operating two&#8208;qubit molecular spin&#8208;based quantum gates over a wide range of operation conditions. Theoretical calculations show that the super&#8208;exchange interaction is granted by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of the vanadyl magnetic orbital despite the tilting angle of the two rings.







Abstract
In the development of two&#8208;qubit quantum gates, precise control over the intramolecular spin&#8208;spin interaction between molecular spin units plays a pivotal role. A weak but measurable exchange coupling is especially important for achieving selective spin addressability that allows controlled manipulation of the computational basis states |00&#10217; |01&#10217; |10&#10217; |11&#10217; by microwave pulses. Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso&#8208;meso (m&#8208;m) singly&#8208;linked VIVO&#8722;CuII porphyrin dimer. X&#8208;band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic CuII porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different g&#8208;tensors of VIV and CuII&#8208;ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role. Therefore, single&#8208;spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Regulates Coordination Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination molecular recognition strategy is proposed to precisely regulate the local coordination structure of single&#8208;atom sites. Specifically, utilizing five&#8208;membered heterocycle molecules as the ligands, the coordination interaction between the guest&#8208;host molecules induces molecular recognition and ensures further precise settlement of the heteroatoms into the local coordination structure of the metal atoms in the single&#8208;atom sites.







Abstract
Coordination engineering for single&#8208;atom sites has drawn increasing attention, yet its chemical synthesis remains a tough issue, especially for tailorable coordination structures. Herein, a molecular recognition strategy is proposed to fabricate single&#8208;atom sites with regulable local coordination structures. Specifically, a heteroatom&#8208;containing ligand serves as the guest molecule to induce coordination interaction with the metal&#8208;containing host, precisely settling the heteroatoms into the local structure of single&#8208;atom sites. As a proof of concept, thiophene is selected as the guest molecule, and sulfur atoms are successfully introduced into the local coordination structure of iron single&#8208;atom sites. Ultrahigh oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity is achieved with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the strategy possesses excellent universality towards diversified types of single&#8208;atom sites. This work makes breakthroughs in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and affords new opportunities in structural regulation at the atomic level.

         <title>Encapsulation of Palladium Carbide Subnanometric Species in Zeolite Boosts Highly Selective Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subnanometric Pd carbide species are encapsulated in MFI zeolite via a carbonization&#8208;reduction method. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The generated carbon species modulate both the Pd species and zeolite support, facilitating alkene desorption and thus leading to superior alkene selectivity.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a crucial step in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, the widely utilized palladium (Pd)&#8208;based catalysts often suffer from poor selectivity. In this work, we demonstrate a carbonization&#8208;reduction method to create palladium carbide subnanometric species within pure silicate MFI zeolite. The carbon species can modify the electronic and steric characteristics of Pd species by forming the predominant Pd&#8722;C4 structure and, meanwhile, facilitate the desorption of alkenes by forming the Si&#8722;O&#8722;C structure with zeolite framework, as validated by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations and theoretical calculations. The developed catalyst shows superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), with 99&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at a complete conversion of phenylacetylene. In contrast, the zeolite&#8208;encapsulated carbon&#8208;free Pd catalyst and the commercial Lindlar catalyst show only 15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;% selectivity to styrene, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. The zeolite&#8208;confined Pd&#8208;carbide subnanoclusters promise their superior properties in semihydrogenation of alkynes.

         <title>Tailored Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron using Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]Indole as a Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;green multiple resonance emitter IDID2BN using indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole skeleton is obtained without sophisticated purification. It has a narrow green emission at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%. The corresponding electroluminescence device shows a high external quantum efficiency of 36.6&#8201;% as well as an extremely small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.1&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd/m2.







Abstract
Extending the &#960;&#8208;skeletons of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) organoboron emitters can feasibly modulate their optoelectronic properties. Here, we first adopt the indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (32bID) segment as a multi&#8208;nitrogen bridge and develop a high&#8208;efficiency &#960;&#8208;extended narrowband green emitter. This moiety establishes not only a high&#8208;yield one&#8208;shot multiple Bora&#8211;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction towards a &#960;&#8208;extended MR skeleton, but a compact N&#8208;ethylene&#8208;N motif for a red&#8208;shifted narrowband emission.

&lt;p&gt;A pure-green multiple resonance emitter &lt;b&gt;IDID2BN&lt;/b&gt; using indolo[3,2-b]indole skeleton is obtained without sophisticated purification. It has a narrow green emission at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%. The corresponding electroluminescence device shows a high external quantum efficiency of 36.6&#8201;% as well as an extremely small efficiency roll-off of 28.1&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending the &#960;-skeletons of multi-resonance (MR) organoboron emitters can feasibly modulate their optoelectronic properties. Here, we first adopt the indolo[3,2-b]indole (32bID) segment as a multi-nitrogen bridge and develop a high-efficiency &#960;-extended narrowband green emitter. This moiety establishes not only a high-yield one-shot multiple Bora&#8211;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction towards a &#960;-extended MR skeleton, but a compact N-ethylene-N motif for a red-shifted narrowband emission. An emission peak at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are concurrently obtained in dilute toluene. The extended molecular plane also results in a large horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 87&#8201;%. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% and a maximum power efficiency of 135.2&#8197;lm/W are thereafter recorded for the corresponding device, also allowing a low efficiency roll-off with EQEs of 34.5&#8201;% and 28.1&#8201;% at luminance of 1,000&#8197;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 10,000&#8197;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Precise Detection of the Pulmonary Metastatic Tumors: A Traditional Molecule Having a Stunning Turn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reinventing strategy was exploited to develop an activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (PMT9) for lung tumor&#8208;specific imaging. The obtained PMT9 exhibited ultra&#8208;sensitivity towards tumor metabolic acidity, which makes it exclusively shine in lung tumor lesions rather than normal lung tissues, enabling precise detection of pulmonary metastasis as well as primary lung tumor, with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
An accurate detection of lung metastasis is of great significance for making better treatment choices and improving cancer prognosis, but remains a big challenge in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a reinventing strategy to develop a pH&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoprobe, pulmonary metastasis tracer (denoted as PMT), based on assembly of NIR dye IR780 and calcium phosphate (CaP). By delicately tuning the intermolecular interactions during the assembly process and dye doping content, as well as the synthetic condition of probe, the fluorescence of PMT could be finely adjusted via the tumor acidity&#8208;triggered disassembly. Notably, the selected PMT9 could sharply convert subtle pH variations into a distinct fluorescence signal to generate high fluorescence ON/OFF contrast, dramatically reducing the background signals. Benefiting from such preferable features, PMT9 is able to precisely identify not only the tumor sites in orthotopic lung cancer models but also the pulmonary metastases in mice with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR). This study provides a unique strategy to turn shortcomings of traditional dye IR780 during in vivo imaging into advantages and further expand the application of fluorescent probe to image lung associated tumor lesions.

         <title>Structural and Catalytic Insight into the Unique Pentacyclic Triterpene Synthase TwOSC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of oxidosqualene cyclase from Tripterygium wilfordii (TwOSC) was determined. This enzyme promotes a multistep cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade reaction to generate diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid skeletons. QM/MM simulations were performed and key residues identified to reveal the CSR mechanism. Semirational design of TwOSC was then carried out to promote friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) catalyzed cyclization of the linear substrate (3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;oxidosqualene to form diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid (PT) skeletons is one of the most complex reactions in nature. Friedelin has a unique PT skeleton involving a fascinating nine&#8208;step cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade rearrangement reaction, in which the carbocation formed at C2 moves to the other side of the skeleton, runs back to C3 to yield a friedelin cation, which is finally deprotonated. However, as crystal structure data of plant OSCs are lacking, it remains unknown why the CSR cascade reactions occur in friedelin biosynthesis, as does the exact catalytic mechanism of the CSR. In this study, we determined the first cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a plant OSC, friedelin synthase, from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (TwOSC). We also performed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to reveal the energy profile for the CSR cascade reaction and identify key residues crucial for PT skeleton formation. Furthermore, we semirationally designed two TwOSC mutants, which significantly improved the yields of friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin, respectively.

         <title>Ag+&#8208;Doped InSe Nanosheets for Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer toward Large&#8208;Current Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to a single liquid product, ethanol, in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer is achieved by Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets. Ag+ doping can tailor active sites for maneuvering reaction intermediates toward ethanol production while enhancing the durability of active sites at high current densities.







Abstract
It is an appealing approach to CO2 utilization through CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) to ethanol at high current density; however, the commonly used Cu&#8208;based catalysts cannot sustain large current during CO2ER despite their capability for ethanol production. Herein, we report that Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets with Se vacancies can address this grand challenge in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the Ag+ doping, which can tailor the electronic structure of InSe while diversifying catalytically active sites, enables the formation of key reaction intermediates and their sequential evolution into ethanol. More importantly, such a material can well work for large&#8208;current conditions in MEA electrolyzers with In2+ species stabilized via electron transfer from Ag to Se. Remarkably, in an MEA electrolyzer by coupling cathodic CO2ER with anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the optimal catalyst exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 68.7&#8201;% and a partial current density of 186.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on the cathode with a full&#8208;cell ethanol energy efficiency of 26.1&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;V. This work opens an avenue for large&#8208;current production of ethanol from CO2 with high selectivity and energy efficiency by rationally designing electrocatalysts.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Nitrogen Cluster Providing a Local Proton for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of isostructural Cu6 clusters (Cu6&#8722;NH, Cu6&#8722;N and Cu6&#8722;py) enabled the structure&#8722;activity relationship in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to be studied at the atomic level. The protonated pyrimidine N in Cu6&#8722;NH could act as a proton relay station to provide a local proton, enabling the formation of the key *COOH intermediate during CO generation, which significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Atomically precise Cu clusters are highly desirable as catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and they provide an appropriate model platform for elaborating their structure&#8211;activity relationship. However, an efficient overall photocatalytic CO2RR with H2O using assembled Cu&#8208;cluster aggregates as single component photocatalyst has not been reported. Herein, we report a stable crystalline Cu&#8722;S&#8722;N cluster photocatalyst with local protonated N&#8722;H groups (denoted as Cu6&#8722;NH). The catalyst exhibits suitable photocatalytic redox potentials, high structural stability, active catalytic species, and a narrow band gap, which account for its outstanding photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light, with &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity for CO evolution. Remarkably, systematic isostructural Cu&#8208;cluster control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed that the protonated pyrimidine N atoms in the Cu6&#8722;NH cluster act as a proton relay station, providing a local proton during the photocatalytic CO2RR. This efficiently lowers the energy barrier for the formation of the *COOH intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step, efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work lays the foundation for the development of atomically precise metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalysts.

The protonated pyrimidine N in &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;/b&gt; could act as a proton relay station to provide a local proton, enabling the formation of the key *COOH intermediate during CO generation, which significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically precise Cu clusters are highly desirable as catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR), and they provide an appropriate model platform for elaborating their structure&#8211;activity relationship. However, an efficient overall photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O using assembled Cu-cluster aggregates as single component photocatalyst has not been reported. Herein, we report a stable crystalline Cu&#8722;S&#8722;N cluster photocatalyst with local protonated N&#8722;H groups (denoted as &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;/b&gt;). The catalyst exhibits suitable photocatalytic redox potentials, high structural stability, active catalytic species, and a narrow band gap, which account for its outstanding photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance under visible light, with &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity for CO evolution. Remarkably, systematic isostructural Cu-cluster control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed that the protonated pyrimidine N atoms in the &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;/b&gt; cluster act as a proton relay station, providing a local proton during the photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. This efficiently lowers the energy barrier for the formation of the *COOH intermediate, which is the rate-limiting step, efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work lays the foundation for the development of atomically precise metal-cluster-based photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Elastomer for Multi&#8208;Level Encryption and Transient Information Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dual&#8208;responsive polydomain liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are developed, which can change from opaque to transparent states under strain or temperature stimuli. The as&#8208;prepared LCEs can achieve multi&#8208;level information encryption based on strain response and real&#8208;time, rewritable transient information display upon incorporating photothermal multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes.







Abstract
Information security has gained increasing attention in the past decade, leading to the development of advanced materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption and instantaneous information display. However, it remains challenging to achieve high information security with simple encryption procedures and low&#8208;energy stimuli. Herein, a series of strain/temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are developed to achieve dual&#8208;modal, multi&#8208;level information encryption and real&#8208;time, rewritable transient information display. The as&#8208;prepared polydomain LCEs can change from an opaque state to a transparent state under strain or temperature stimuli, with the transition strains or temperatures highly dependent on the concentration of long&#8208;chain flexible spacers. Information encrypted by different LCE inks can be decrypted under specific strains or temperatures, leading to multi&#8208;level protection of information security. Furthermore, with the combination of the phase transition of polydomain LCEs and the photothermal effect of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), we achieved a repeatable transient information display by using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light as a pen for writing. This study provides new insight into the development of advanced encryption materials with versatility and high security for broad applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;Substituted Styrenes via Late&#8208;Stage Stereomutation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes has been developed, providing a convenient and efficient approach to enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products. The key of the success is the development of a formal late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which could enable chiral cis&#8208;isomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer, thus achieving high diastereocontrol.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes. The lynchpin of success is ascribed to the development of a late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which enables enantioenriched cis&#8208;isomers among a couple of early&#8208;generated diastereomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer counterparts, thus fulfilling high diastereocontrol; while the degree of enantio&#8208;differentiation is determined by the borocupration process of the C=C bond. This reaction provides an efficient protocol to access enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208; dioxygenation products. The value of this method has further been highlighted in a diversity of follow&#8208;up stereospecific transformations and further modifying complex molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Interplay of Dual&#8208;Active&#8208;Sites on Metallic Ni&#8208;MOFs Loaded with Pt for Thermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Conversion of Atmospheric CO2 under Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) loaded with Pt was fabricated, which has dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites for separately boosting atmospheric CO2 capture and in situ photocatalytic conversion under infrared light irradiation. This finding opens a promising route to use conductive MOFs as new generation photocatalysts for efficient conversion of trace CO2 via energy&#8208;efficient methods.







Abstract
Infrared light driven photocatalytic reduction of atmospheric CO2 is challenging due to the ultralow concentration of CO2 (0.04&#8201;%) and the low energy of infrared light. Herein, we develop a metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework loaded with Pt (Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF), which shows excellent activity for thermal&#8208;photocatalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 with H2 even under infrared light irradiation. The open Ni sites are beneficial to capture and activate atmospheric CO2, while the photogenerated electrons dominate H2 dissociation on the Pt sites. Simultaneously, thermal energy results in spilling of the dissociated H2 to Ni sites, where the adsorbed CO2 is thermally reduced to CO and CH4. The synergistic interplay of dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites renders Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF a record efficiency of 9.57&#8201;% at 940&#8197;nm for converting atmospheric CO2, enables the procurement of CO2 to be independent of the emission sources, and improves the energy efficiency for trace CO2 conversion by eliminating the capture media regeneration and molecular CO2 release.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Biltz Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic enantioselective Biltz synthesis is established, which provides a straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins in high yields with excellent stereocontrol. Isotopic tracer experiments and DFT calculations reveal an exclusive 1,2&#8208;ester shift process. The observed enantioselectivity and regioselectivity originate from [3+2] cyclization step.







Abstract
The Biltz synthesis establishes straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins by combining a 1,2&#8208;diketone and a (thio)urea. Its appealing features include inherent atom and step economy together with the potential to generate structurally diverse products. However, control of the stereochemistry of this reaction has proven to be a daunting challenge. Herein, we describe the first example of enantioselective catalytic Biltz synthesis which affords more than 40 thiohydantoins with high stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control, irrespective of the symmetry of thiourea structure. A one pot synthesis of corresponding hydantoins is also documented. Remarkably, experimental studies and DFT calculations establish the reaction pathway and origin of stereoselectivity.

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Cobalt&#8208;Doped 1T&#8208;MoS2 Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic ligand modulation plus cobalt doping strategy is applied to modulate the orbital hybridization of 1T&#8208;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;MOF precursors. The polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpe) ligand can stably link with 1T&#8208;MoS2 layers to achieve expanded interlayer spacing, which promotes the joint participation of highly efficient active sites in the basal plane and the interlayer in alkaline HER processes.







Abstract
Highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst will determine the mass distributions of hydrogen&#8208;powered clean technologies, while still faces grand challenges. In this work, a synergistic ligand modulation plus Co doping strategy is applied to 1T&#8722;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;metal&#8208;organic frameworks precursors, boosting the HER catalytic activity and durability of 1T&#8722;MoS2. Confirmed by Cs corrected transmission electron microscope and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane ligand can stably link with two&#8208;dimensional 1T&#8722;MoS2 layers through cobalt sites to expand interlayer spacing of MoS2 (Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe), which promotes active site exposure, accelerates water dissociation, and optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H in alkaline HER processes. Theoretical calculations indicate the promotions in the electronic structure of 1T&#8722;MoS2 originate in the formation of three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic constructs by linking &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligand, which weakens the hybridization between Mo&#8208;3d and S&#8208;2p orbitals, and in turn makes S&#8208;2p orbital more suitable for hybridization with H&#8208;1s orbital. Therefore, Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe exhibits excellent stability and exceedingly low overpotential for alkaline HER (118&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In addition, integrated into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe is much superior to the Pt/C catalyst at the large current densities. This study provides a feasible ligand modulation strategy for designs of two&#8208;dimensional catalysts.

         <title>Tuning the Catalytic Activity of a Pincer Complex of Rhodium(I) by Supramolecular and Redox Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties of a (CNC)&#8208;pincer Rh(I) complex decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety have been shown to be modified in response to supramolecular (coronene) or redox (fluoride) additives. This leads to a significant modification of its catalytic activity toward the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids.







Abstract
We report the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CNC&#8722;NDI)(CO)]+, in which CNC&#8722;NDI refers to a pincer&#8208;CNC ligand decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety. Due to the presence of the planar CNC ligand and the naphthalenediimide moiety, the electronic nature of the complex can be modulated by means of supramolecular and redox stimuli, respectively. The metal complex shows a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking interaction with coronene. This interaction has an impact on the electron&#8208;richness of the metal, as demonstrated by the shifting of the &#957;(CO) stretching band to a lower frequency. The addition of tetrabutylammonium fluoride facilitates the sequential one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction of the NDI moiety of the ligand, thus resulting in a situation in which the ligand can increase its electron&#8208;donor strength in two levels. The nature of the interaction with the fluoride anion was studied computationally. The catalytic activity of the [Rh(CNC&#8722;NDI)(CO)]+ complex was tested in the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids, where it is observed that the activity of the catalyst can be modulated between four levels of activity, which correspond to i) the use of the unmodified catalyst, ii) catalyst+coronene, iii) catalyst+2&#8197;equivalents of fluoride, and iv) catalyst+5&#8197;equivalents of fluoride.

         <title>Visible Light Photoiniferter Polymerization for Dispersity Control in High Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoiniferter RAFT polymerization was used to tune the dispersity in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers (up to ca. 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as well as in multiblock copolymers. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogeneous radical source, visible&#8208;light regulation, and high end&#8208;group fidelity and holds great potential for the synthesis of pre&#8208;designed materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.







Abstract
The synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights, controlled sequence, and tunable dispersities remains a challenge. A simple and effective visible&#8208;light controlled photoiniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported here to realize this goal. Key to this strategy is the use of switchable RAFT agents (SRAs) to tune polymerization activities coupled with the inherent highly living nature of photoiniferter RAFT polymerization. The polymerization activities of SRAs were in situ adjusted by the addition of acid. In addition to a switchable chain&#8208;transfer coefficient, photolysis and polymerization kinetic studies revealed that neutral and protonated SRAs showed different photolysis and polymerization rates, which is unique to photoiniferter RAFT polymerization in terms of dispersity control. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogenous radical source, temporal regulation by visible light, and tunable dispersities in the unprecedented high molecular weight regime (up to 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Pentablock copolymers with three different dispersity combinations were also synthesized, highlighting that the highly living nature was maintained even for blocks with large dispersities. Tg was lowered for high&#8208;dispersity polymers of similar MWs due to the existence of more low&#8208;MW polymers. This strategy holds great potential for the synthesis of advanced materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides in good to high levels of enantiomeric excess was achieved using a chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst. Experimental results together with DFT calculations support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process, whose efficiency is impacted by developing steric interactions in the syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate complexes.







Abstract
Although there are many methods for the asymmetric synthesis of monosubstituted allylic fluorides, construction of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides has not been reported. To address this gap, we report an enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides using chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF as a source of fluoride, and Morita Baylis Hillman (MBH) trichloroacetimidates. Kinetic studies show that one enantiomer of racemic MBH substrate reacts faster than the other. Computational studies reveal that both syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes are formed upon ionization of allylic substrate, and the syn complexes are slightly energetically favorable. This is in contrast to our previous observation for formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates, in which the syn &#960;&#8208;allyl conformation is strongly preferred. In addition, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C2 position of racemic MBH substrate renders 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate formation endergonic and reversible. To compare, formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates was exergonic and irreversible. DFT calculations and kinetic studies support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process wherein the rate of isomerization of the 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium complexes is faster than that of fluoride addition onto the more reactive intermediate. The 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides were obtained in good yields, enantioselectivity, and branched selectivity.

         <title>Subrutilane&#8212;A Hexacyclic Sesterterpene from Streptomyces subrutilus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining uncovered a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus that produces the first known hexacyclic sesterterpene with no double bonds as the main product, as well as eight pentacyclic products. Isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations revealed a cyclisation cascade via several well&#8208;stabilised secondary cations. The enzyme also converted several substrate analogues into sesterterpenoid compounds.







Abstract
Mining of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus resulted in the identification of the hexacyclic sesterterpene subrutilane, besides eight pentacyclic side products. Subrutilane represents the first case of a saturated sesterterpene hydrocarbon. Its structure, including the absolute configuration, was unambiguously determined through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and stereoselective deuteration. The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)&#8208;GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogues (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP and (2Z,7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP with blocked reactivity at the C6&#8722;C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)&#8208;GFPP and the saturated substrate analogues were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.

A &#8220;chameleon catalyst&#8221; for hydrogenation reactions: The selectivity of an amine&#8208;functionalized ruthenium nanoparticles&#8208;based catalyst can be switched in the hydrogenation of bicyclic heteroaromatics by controlling the feedgas composition, unlocking adaptivity in product formation. The selectivity switch is reversible, rapid, and robust, and originates from the formation of ammonium formate species under H2/CO2, and their decomposition under H2, as reported by Alexis Bordet, Walter Leitner et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311427).

The synthesis of new molecules and materials does not always involve creating bonds.&#160;In their Research Article (e202310354), Jorge Albalad, Inhar Imaz, Daniel Maspoch et&#8197;al. show how bond scission becomes a powerful synthetic tool to design new molecules and materials when the cleavage step is quantitative, selective, and carefully controlled. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, unprecedented Rh(II)&#8208;based architectures (clusters, a crown, and a macrocycle) were obtained through the retrosynthetic disassembly of metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) via Clip&#8208;off Chemistry.

Calculating temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes is like a scavenger hunt. In their Research Article (e202308803), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez et&#8197;al. show that in [Ru(bpy)3]2+, the pathway governed by the lowest&#160;3MC&#8208;trans excited state triplet minimum leads astray. Instead, through the concept of rate&#8208;determining states and an extended kinetic model that takes all the different Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers into account, excellent agreement with the experiment is attained.

         <title>Key Strategies for Enhancing H2 Production in Transition Metal Oxide Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview critically discusses the most promising strategies to improve hydrogen evolution on transition metal based photocatalysts along with future research directions.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) were one of the first photocatalysts used to produce hydrogen from water using solar energy. Despite the emergence of many other genres of photocatalysts over the years, TMO photocatalysts remain dominant due to their easy synthesis and unique physicochemical properties. Various strategies have been developed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TMOs, but the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of TMO photocatalysts is still very low (&lt;2&#8201;%), which is far below the targeted STH of 10&#8201;% for commercial viability. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of several widely used strategies, including oxygen defects control, doping, establishing interfacial junctions, and phase&#8208;facet&#8208;morphology engineering, that have been adopted to improve TMO photocatalysts. By critically evaluating these strategies and providing a roadmap for future research directions, this article serves as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals seeking to develop efficient energy materials for green energy solutions.

Abstract
Aliphatic polycarbonates (aPCs) have become increasingly popular as functional materials due to their biocompatibility and capacity for on&#8208;demand degradation. Advances in polymerization techniques and the introduction of new functional monomers have expanded the library of aPCs available, offering a diverse range of chemical compositions and structures. To accommodate the emerging requirements of new applications in biomedical and energy&#8208;related fields, various manufacturing techniques have been adopted for processing aPC&#8208;based materials. However, a summary of these techniques has yet to be conducted. The aim of this paper is to enrich the toolbox available to researchers, enabling them to select the most suitable technique for their materials. In this paper, a concise review of the recent progress in processing techniques, including controlled self&#8208;assembly, electrospinning, additive manufacturing, and other techniques, is presented. We also highlight the specific challenges and opportunities for the sustainable growth of this research area and the successful integration of aPCs in industrial applications.

         <dc:description>
Oxygenation and amination reactions are widespread in synthetic chemistry to produce valuable compounds. Nowadays, the importance of sustainable strategies to introduce oxygen and amino functionalities into organic molecules is increasing. This review discusses recent examples of multi&#8208;step biocatalytic cascades involving oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions to produce value&#8208;added compounds such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are a powerful tool for building complex molecules containing oxygen and nitrogen functionalities. Moreover, the combination of multiple enzymes in one pot offers the possibility to minimize downstream processing and waste production. In this review, we illustrate various recent efforts in the development of multi&#8208;step syntheses involving C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming enzymes to produce high value&#8208;added compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors. Both in vitro and in vivo examples are discussed, revealing the respective advantages and drawbacks. The use of engineered enzymes to boost the cascades outcome is also addressed and current co&#8208;substrate and cofactor recycling strategies are presented, highlighting the importance of atom economy. Finally, tools to overcome current challenges for multi&#8208;enzymatic oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions are discussed, including flow systems with immobilized biocatalysts and cascades in confined nanomaterials.

Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach for the synthesis of hierarchical biomaterials. Hence,it is essential to directly observe the assembly dynamics and structural evolution using in situ characterization approaches. These measurements reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism for improving the accuracy of biomaterials design.







Abstract
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly of hierarchical materials is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach to synthesizing across scales with considerable energy, health, environment, sustainability, and information technology applications. To achieve desired functions in biomaterials, it is essential to directly observe assembly dynamics and structural evolutions that reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism. This review will summarize the current understanding of biomolecular assembly mechanisms based on in situ characterization and discuss the broader significance and achievements of newly gained insights. In addition, we will also introduce how emerging deep learning/machine learning&#8208;based approaches, multiparametric characterization, and high&#8208;throughput methods can boost the development of biomolecular self&#8208;assembly. The objective of this review is to accelerate the development of in situ characterization approaches for biomolecular self&#8208;assembly and to inspire the next generation of biomimetic materials.

To achieve desired functions in biomaterials, it is essential to directly observe assembly dynamics and structural evolutions that reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism. This review will summarize the current understanding of biomolecular assembly mechanisms based on in situ characterization and discuss the broader significance and achievements of newly gained insights. In addition, we will also introduce how emerging deep learning/machine learning-based approaches, multiparametric characterization, and high-throughput methods can boost the development of biomolecular self-assembly. The objective of this review is to accelerate the development of in situ characterization approaches for biomolecular self-assembly and to inspire the next generation of biomimetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Well&#8208;Defined Fluoropolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;demand synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoropolymer is important to meet diverse requirements in high&#8208;end applications. This minireview discusses challenges in controlled radical copolymerizations of fluoroalkene feedstocks with non&#8208;fluorinated vinyl comonomers, highlights recent developments toward controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain fluorinated copolymers and emerging explorations toward applications.







Abstract
In the past 80&#8197;years, fluoropolymers have found broad applications in both industrial and academic settings, owing to their unique physicochemical properties. Copolymerizations of fluoroalkene feedstocks present an important avenue to obtain high&#8208;performance materials by merging intrinsic attributes of fluorocarbons and great versatility of comonomers. Recently, while massive investigations have disclosed the great potentials of precisely synthesized polymers, researchers have made considerable efforts to approach well&#8208;defined fluorinated copolymers. This minireview discusses challenges in controlled radical copolymerizations (CRCPs) of fluoroalkenes and provides a concise perspective on recent progress in CRCPs of fluoroalkenes (e.g., tetrafluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, hexafluoropropene, perfluoroalkyl vinyl ethers) with non&#8208;fluorinated vinyl comonomers, which have enabled on&#8208;demand preparations of various main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers with predefined molar masses, low dispersities, as well as regulable chemical compositions and sequences. The synthetic advantages of CRCPs will promote controlled and facile access to customized fluoropolymers for high&#8208;tech applications such as batteries, coatings and so on.

         <title>The Universal Super Cation&#8208;Conductivity in Multiple&#8208;cation Mixed Chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several cost&#8208;effective multiple&#8208;cation mixed chloride SSEs with high Li+ conductivity over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 can be synthesized with abundant and cheap Al, La, Ce, Zr, etc. elements. The UCl3&#8208;type skeleton can intake various materials into the skeleton from metal chlorides (MCl, M=Li, Na, K, Cu, Ag) to metal oxides (Li2O) and also displays super&#8208;conduction behavior for those monovalent cations (0.77&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Ag+ conduction).







Abstract
As exciting candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are highly dependent on advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, using cost&#8208;effective LaCl3 and CeCl3 lattice (UCl3&#8208;type structure) as the host and further combined with a multiple&#8208;cation mixed strategy, we report a series of UCl3&#8208;type SSEs with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and good compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. The intrinsic large&#8208;size hexagonal one&#8208;dimensional channels and highly disordered amorphous phase induced by multi&#8208;metal cation species are believed to trigger fast multiple ionic conductions of Li+, Na+, K+, Cu+, and Ag+. The UCl3&#8208;type SSEs enable a stable prototype ASSLB capable of over 3000&#8197;cycles and high reversibility at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. Further exploration of the brand&#8208;new multiple&#8208;cation mixed chlorides is likely to lead to the development of advanced halide SSEs suitable for ASSLBs with high energy density.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloadditions of Indoles with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Indoline Fused Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes

         <dc:description>
A silver Lewis acid catalyzes dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutanes to afford indoline fused bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) bearing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers in high yields and with an opposite regioselectivity compared to the classical pathway.







Abstract
Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are becoming ever more important in drug design and development as bridged scaffolds that provide underexplored chemical space, but are difficult to access. Here a silver&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of indoline fused BCHs from N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutane precursors is described. The strain&#8208;release dearomative cycloaddition operates under mild conditions, tolerating a wide range of functional groups. It is capable of forming BCHs with up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers, achieving yields of up to 99&#8201;%. In addition, a scale&#8208;up experiment and the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts further highlighted the synthetic utility.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Fluoroaroylation for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
An alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis is reported. The introduced strategy also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones have attracted significant attention as valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. Such compounds are generally accessed through trifluoromethylation of ketones. Here we report an alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This strategy bypasses the use of expensive or sensitive trifluoromethylation reagents and/or the requirement for ketone pre&#8208;functionalization, thus enabling an efficient and general synthetic method to access &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted ketones. A wide variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.

         <title>On the Electride Nature of Na&#8208;hP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Na&#8208;hP4 phase, a high pressure electride, contains clusters of eleven sodium atoms within which charge is localized. Quantum chemical calculations show that this build&#8208;up of interstitial charge stems from the overlap of pd hybrid orbitals on the sodium atoms comprising this cluster, resulting in the formation of a multicentered bond, increased density, and semiconducting behavior.







Abstract
Early quantum mechanical models suggested that pressure drives solids towards free&#8208;electron metal behavior where the ions are locked into simple close&#8208;packed structures. The prediction and subsequent discovery of high&#8208;pressure electrides (HPEs), compounds assuming open structures where the valence electrons are localized in interstitial voids, required a paradigm shift. Our quantum chemical calculations on the iconic insulating Na&#8208;hP4 HPE show that increasing density causes a 3s&#8594;3pd electronic transition due to Pauli repulsion between the 1s2s and 3s states, and orthogonality of the 3pd states to the core. The large lobes of the resulting Na&#8208;pd hybrid orbitals point towards the center of an 11&#8208;membered penta&#8208;capped trigonal prism and overlap constructively, forming multicentered bonds, which are responsible for the emergence of the interstitial charge localization in Na&#8208;hP4. These multicentered bonds facilitate the increased density of this phase, which is key for its stabilization under pressure.

         <title>Expanding the Range of Bioorthogonal Tags for Multiplex Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy with spectral phasor analysis enables the multiplex detection of bioorthogonal Raman groups in cells. Unmixing of the overlapping alkyne and deuterium signals together with the detection of metallacarboranes is reported within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum.







Abstract
Multiplex optical detection in live cells is challenging due to overlapping signals and poor signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise associated with some chemical reporters. To address this, the application of spectral phasor analysis to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for unmixing three bioorthogonal Raman probes within cells is reported. Triplex detection of a metallacarborane using the B&#8722;H stretch at 2480&#8211;2650&#8197;cm&#8722;1, together with a bis&#8208;alkyne and deuterated fatty acid can be achieved within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum. When coupled to imaging in the high&#8208;wavenumber region of the cellular Raman spectrum, nine discrete regions of interest can be spectrally unmixed from the hyperspectral SRS dataset, demonstrating a new capability in the toolkit of multiplexed Raman imaging of live cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization of Complementary Aromatic Oligoamide Strands in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various aromatic oligoamide strands were designed to self&#8208;assemble as homomeric double helices in water. We found that chemically inequivalent aromatic strands were able to hybridize selectively and quantitatively to form heteromeric double helices. The steric effects in the double helix cavity were found to be the main reason explaining the high selectivity of the hybridization.







Abstract
We prepared a series of water&#8208;soluble aromatic oligoamide sequences all composed of a segment prone to form a single helix and a segment prone to dimerize into a double helix. These sequences exclusively assemble as antiparallel duplexes. The modification of the duplex inner rim by varying the nature of the substituents borne by the aromatic monomers allowed us to identify sequences that can hybridize by combining two chemically different strands, with high affinity and complete selectivity in water. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the expected antiparallel configuration of the duplexes whereas NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry allowed us to assess precisely the extent of the hybridization. The hybridization kinetics of the aromatic strands was shown to depend on both the nature of the substituents responsible for strand complementarity and the length of the aromatic strand. These results highlight the great potential of aromatic hetero&#8208;duplex as a tool to construct non&#8208;symmetrical dynamic supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Accessing Ta/Cu Architectures via Metal&#8208;Metal Salt Metatheses: Heterobimetallic C&#8722;H Bond Activation Affords &#956;&#8208;Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonyl&#8208;free metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis protocol facilitates heteromultimetallic complex formation. Bridging hydride ligands, originating from both an arene C&#8722;H activation event and H&#8208;atom transfer from solvent, stabilize unusual Cu&#8722;Ta bimetallics. These complexes are suitable platforms for subsequent metathesis chemistry, affording a tetranuclear complex featuring a highly reduced TaCu3 cluster.







Abstract
We employ a metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis strategy to access low&#8208;valent tantalum&#8208;copper heterometallic architectures (Ta&#8722;&#956;2&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu and Ta&#8722;&#956;3&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu3) that emulate structural elements proposed for surface alloyed nanomaterials. Whereas cluster assembly with carbonylmetalates is well precedented, the use of the corresponding polyarene transition metal anions is underexplored, despite recognition of these highly reactive fragments as storable sources of atomic Mn&#8722;. Our application of this strategy provides structurally unique early&#8208;late bimetallic species. These complexes incorporate bridging hydride ligands during their syntheses, the origin of which is elucidated via detailed isotopic labelling studies. Modification of ancillary ligand sterics and electronics alters the mechanism of bimetallic assembly; a trinuclear complex resulting from dinuclear C&#8722;H activation is demonstrated as an intermediate en route to formation of the bimetallic. Further validating the promise of this rational, bottom&#8208;up approach, a unique tetranuclear species was synthesized, featuring a Ta centre bearing three Ta&#8722;Cu interactions.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Polynucleotide Brush Growth on DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel strategies allow for both spatial and temporal control of polynucleotide brush modification on DNA origami through activation and regeneration of initiation sites using restriction enzymes in combination with TdT&#8208;catalyzed enzymatic polymerization. Spatiotemporal control of brush growth provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications ranging from drug delivery to supracolloidal assembly.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides an approach to create precise, tunable, and biocompatible nanostructures for biomedical applications. However, the stability of these structures is severely compromised in biological milieu due to their fast degradation by nucleases. Recently, we showed how enzymatic polymerization could be harnessed to grow polynucleotide brushes of tunable length and location on the surface of DNA origami nanostructures, which greatly enhances their nuclease stability. Here, we report on strategies that allow for both spatial and temporal control over polymerization through activatable initiation, cleavage, and regeneration of polynucleotide brushes using restriction enzymes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes in a spatiotemporally controlled way provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications in drug delivery and supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Pushing Up the Size Limit of Boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;Acenes: Modular Synthesis and Characterizations</title>

We present a one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA, B&#8208;[4,3]PA and B&#8208;[7,2]PA derivatives. This study not only enriches the scope of the [n,m]PA family but also provides a straightforward strategy of boron incorporation into zigzag edges of &#960;&#8208;extended PAs, which also enables precise modification of their physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (PAs) have recently attracted considerable attention considering their fascinating physical properties and chemical stability. However, the precise sole addition of boron atoms along the zigzag edges of PAs remains challenging, primarily due to the limited synthetic approach. Herein, we present a novel one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped PAs (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA (1&#8201;a&#8208;2), B&#8208;[4,3]PA (1&#8201;b&#8208;2) and B&#8208;[7,2]PA (1&#8201;c&#8208;3) derivatives, through efficient intramolecular electrophilic borylation. Their chemical structures are unequivocally confirmed with a combination of mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, 1&#8201;b&#8208;2 exhibits an almost planar geometry, whereas 1&#8201;a&#8208;2 displays a distinctive bowl&#8208;like distortion. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of this series of B&#8208;PAs are thoroughly investigated by UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with DFT calculation. Compared with their parent all&#8208;carbon analogs, the obtained B&#8208;PAs exhibit high stability, wide energy gaps, and high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 84&#8201;%. This study reveals the exceptional ability of boron doping to finely tune the physicochemical properties of PAs, showcasing their potential applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Controllable Regiodivergent Alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Activated by Distinct Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters using distinct organometallic reagents has been developed. Mechanistic studies revealed that unique chelation patterns are essential in determining selectivity. This approach overcomes the drawbacks associated with coupling reactions through radical mechanisms, which commonly yield the classical products reacting through stable radical species.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8722;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.

         <title>Stereoselective Unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;Diborylation of Alkynes with a Neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 Diboron Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;diborylation of alkynes with a neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron reagent has been demonstrated. The transformation leads to the spontaneous introduction of two chemically easily distinguishable boryl groups at the same carbon center. This method finds applications in the controllable stepwise downstream functionalization of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes, as well as the one&#8208;pot synthesis of acylboranes.







Abstract
The incorporation of two distinct boryl groups at the same carbon center in organic molecules has attracted growing research interest due to its potential for facilitating controlled, precise synthesis through stepwise dual carbon&#8208;boron bond transformations. Here we report a method to access unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;diborylalkene (UDBA) stereoselectively via the reaction of readily available alkynes with a neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron reagent (NHC)BH2&#8208;Bpin (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Attributing to the chemically easily distinguishable nature of the sp2 and sp3 boryl moieties, controllable stepwise derivatization of the resultant UDBAs is realized. This process leads to various multifunctionalized olefins and organoborons, such as acylboranes, which are difficult to prepare by other methods.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Homoleptic Diphosphene Lead Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homoleptic diphosphene lead complex was synthesized through controllable degradation of P4 by a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized plumbylone which possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions. The diphosphene lead complex exhibits intriguing reactivity involving the delivery of Pb(0) to perform redox reaction with iminoquinone thus producing a cyclic plumbylene and undergoing a NHC&#8208;induced two&#8208;step phosphorus cation abstraction reaction.







Abstract
Due to their limited capacity for &#960;&#8208;backdonation, isolation of &#960;&#8208;complexes of main&#8208;group elements remains a great challenge. We report herein the synthesis of a homoleptic diphosphene lead complex (2) from the degradation of P4 with a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized Pb(0) complex. Structural and computational studies showed that 2 possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions between Pb atom and diphosphene ligands, which is reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal diphosphene complexes. Consistent with its unique electronic structure, complex 2 can deliver Pb(0) atoms to perform redox reaction with an iminoquinone to produce a cyclic plumbylene (4) and perform 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene (IMe2Me2) induced phosphorus cation abstraction to give an anionic PbP3 complex (6).

Consistent with its unique electronic structure, complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; can deliver Pb(0) atoms to perform redox reaction with an iminoquinone to produce a cyclic plumbylene (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and perform 2,5-dimethyl-3,4-dimethylimidazol-1-ylidene (IMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) induced phosphorus cation abstraction to give an anionic PbP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complex (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dearomatization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective alkynylation of pyridine is reported. The reaction is enabled by StackPhos and proceeds with excellent regioselectivity (25&#8201;:&#8201;1), enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee), and yield (up to 99&#8201;%). Terminal alkynes with a wide range of functional groups work well in the transformation, including acetylene gas, paving the way for the use of these feedstock starting materials to rapidly access highly useful synthetic intermediates.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative alkynylation of pyridines is reported with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The synthetically valuable enantioenriched 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine products afforded are generated from the readily available feedstock, pyridine, and commercially available terminal alkynes. The three&#8208;component reaction between a pyridine, a terminal alkyne, and methyl chloroformate employs copper chloride and StackPhos, a chiral biaryl P,N&#8208; ligand, as the catalytic system. Under mild reaction conditions, the desired 1,2&#8208;addition products are delivered in up to 99&#8201;% yield with regioselectivity ratios up to 25&#8201;:&#8201;1 and enantioselectivities values of up to 99&#8201;% ee. Activated and non&#8208;activated terminal alkynes containing a wide range of functional groups are well tolerated. Even acetylene gas delivered mono&#8208;alkynylated products in high yield and ee. Application of the methodology in an efficient enantioselective synthesis of the chiral piperidine indolizidine, coniceine, is reported.

         <title>Reversible Boron&#8208;Insertion into Aromatic C&#8722;C Bonds</title>

Unprecedented formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via reversible boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes. The reaction mechanism was clarified to consist of sequential two electrocyclic reactions with E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety through a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.







Abstract
Formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of triarylboranes bearing an ortho&#8208;phosphino substituent (ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes). The borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives were fully characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses. The dearomatized products were demonstrated to undergo the reverse reaction in the dark at room temperature, realizing photochemical and thermal interconversion between triarylboranes and boron&#8208;doped bicyclic systems. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that sequential two electrocyclic reactions involving E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety proceed via a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.

         <title>Homolytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Phosphine&#8722;Quinone&#8208;Based Radical Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;electron transfer processes between sterically demanding triarylphosphines and quinones of appropriate electron&#8208;accepting character were investigated. Depending on the steric demand of the phosphine, P&#8722;O coupled adducts or C&#8722;H bond activation products were obtained, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the C&#8722;H bond activation proceeds stepwise via transient radical ion pairs







Abstract
Herein, we present the formation of transient radical ion pairs (RIPs) by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) in phosphine&#8722;quinone systems and explore their potential for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds. PMes3 (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reacts with DDQ (2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) with formation of the P&#8722;O bonded zwitterionic adduct Mes3P&#8722;DDQ (1), while the reaction with the sterically more crowded PTip3 (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) afforded C&#8722;H bond activation product Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2(DDQ)]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (2). UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopic studies showed that the latter reaction proceeds via initial SET, forming RIP [PTip3]&#8901;+[DDQ]&#8901;&#8722;, and subsequent homolytic C&#8722;H bond activation, which was supported by DFT calculations. The isolation of analogous products, Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2{TCQ&#8722;B(C6F5)3}]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (4, TCQ=tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) and Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2{oQtBu&#8722;B(C6F5)3}]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (8, oQtBu=3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzoquinone), from reactions of PTip3 with Lewis&#8208;acid activated quinones, TCQ&#8722;B(C6F5)3 and oQtBu&#8722;B(C6F5)3, respectively, further supports the proposed radical mechanism. As such, this study presents key mechanistic insights into the homolytic C&#8722;H bond activation by the synergistic action of radical ion pairs.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Inversion in Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of carbon nitride as a photocatalyst requires to understand its response to light and the nature of all the photoexcited species formed. Here we devise an original approach based on time&#8208;resolved magnetic resonance to provide the spin state, the energy and wavefunction delocalisation of carbon nitride photoexcited states. We directly measure the energy of the triplet state and demonstrate that it is higher than the corresponding singlet.







Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved EPR (TR&#8208;EPR) demonstrates the formation of well&#8208;defined spin triplet excitons in carbon nitride. This permits to experimentally probe the extent of the triplet wavefunction which delocalizes over several tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the TR&#8208;EPR signal reveals the mobility of the triplet excitons. By employing monochromatic light excitation in the range 430&#8211;600&#8197;nm, the energy of the spin triplet is estimated to be &#8776;0.2&#8197;eV above the conduction band edge, proving that the triplet exciton lies above the corresponding singlet. Comparison between amorphous and graphitic forms establishes the singlet&#8208;triplet inversion as a general feature of carbon nitride materials.

&lt;p&gt;The use of carbon nitride as a photocatalyst requires to understand its response to light and the nature of all the photoexcited species formed. Here we devise an original approach based on time-resolved magnetic resonance to provide the spin state, the energy and wavefunction delocalisation of carbon nitride photoexcited states. We directly measure the energy of the triplet state and demonstrate that it is higher than the corresponding singlet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-resolved EPR (TR-EPR) demonstrates the formation of well-defined spin triplet excitons in carbon nitride. This permits to experimentally probe the extent of the triplet wavefunction which delocalizes over several tri-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-triazine units. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the TR-EPR signal reveals the mobility of the triplet excitons. By employing monochromatic light excitation in the range 430&#8211;600&#8197;nm, the energy of the spin triplet is estimated to be &#8776;0.2&#8197;eV above the conduction band edge, proving that the triplet exciton lies above the corresponding singlet. Comparison between amorphous and graphitic forms establishes the singlet-triplet inversion as a general feature of carbon nitride materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Optimization of Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining high&#8208;throughput experimentation and machine learning technologies, we developed the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dimerization of two sulfoxonium ylides, leading to various unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes. Excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility under mild conditions enable this protocol to be of practical significance. A machine learning model for yield prediction further demonstrated its utilities and generalities.







Abstract
A novel and convenient approach that combines high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) with machine learning (ML) technologies to achieve the first selective cross&#8208;dimerization of sulfoxonium ylides via iridium catalysis is presented. A variety of valuable amide&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, ester&#8208;, and N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes are synthesized in good yields with high stereoselectivities. This mild method avoids the use of diazo compounds and is characterized by simple operation, high step&#8208;economy, and excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility. The combined experimental and computational studies identify an amide&#8208;sulfoxonium ylide as a carbene precursor. Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the reaction space is also performed (600 reactions) and a machine learning model for reaction yield prediction has been constructed.

         <title>Polymer Photocatalysts Containing Segregated &#960;&#8208;Conjugation Units with Electron&#8208;Trap Activity for Efficient Natural&#8208;light&#8208;driven Bacterial Inactivation</title>

Discontinuously conjugated photocatalysts with electron trap are effective for natural light&#8208;induced bacteria inactivation. A low&#8208;toxicity photocatalyst with an electron&#8208;trap was actively assembled by using ethylenediamine and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride via a bottom&#8208;up acidification strategy. The obtained material (EDA&#8208;PTDA) exhibited a superior performance for photocatalytic antibacterial under natural light.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient and metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation under natural light is a major challenge in photocatalytic antibiosis. Herein, we developed an acidizing solvent&#8208;thermal approach for inserting a non&#8208;conjugated ethylenediamine segment into the conjugated planes of 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride to generate a photocatalyst containing segregated &#960;&#8208;conjugation units (EDA&#8208;PTCDA). Under natural light, EDA&#8208;PTCDA achieved 99.9&#8201;% inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (60 and 45&#8197;min), which is the highest efficiency among all the natural light antibacterial reports. The difference in the surface potential and excited charge density corroborated the possibility of a built&#8208;in electron&#8208;trap effect of the non&#8208;conjugated segments of EDA&#8208;PTCDA, thus forming a highly active EDA&#8208;PTDA/bacteria interface. In addition, EDA&#8208;PTCDA exhibited negligible toxicity and damage to normal tissue cells. This catalyst provides a new opportunity for photocatalytic antibiosis under natural light conditions.

         <title>A High&#8208;Affinity &#8220;Synthavidin&#8221; Receptor for Squaraine Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new macrocyclic host binds squaraine dyes with exceptional affinity and selectivity in water, forming stable complexes showing near&#8208;IR fluorescence. These properties suggest application as a &#8220;supramolecular glue&#8221;, complementing the widely used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin pairing.







Abstract
Strong&#8208;binding host&#8211;guest pairings in aqueous media have potential as &#8220;supramolecular glues&#8221; in biomedical techniques, complementing the widely&#8208;used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin combination. We have previously found that squaraine dyes are bound very strongly by tetralactam macrocycles possessing anthracenyl units as cavity walls. Here we show that replacing the anthracenes with pentacyclic 5,7,12,14&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraoxapentacene (TOP) units generates receptors which bind squaraines with increased affinities (around Ka=1010&#8197;m&#8722;1) and improved selectivities. Binding can be followed through changes to squaraine fluorescence and absorbance. The TOP units are easy to prepare and potentially variable, while the TOP&#8208;based receptor shows improved photostability, both in itself and in complex with squaraines. The results suggest that this system could prove valuable in the further development of practical &#8220;synthavidin&#8221; chemistry.

         <title>Switchable Organocatalysis from N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Carbodiimide Adducts with Tunable Release Temperature
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts are used as thermally labile precursors for NHC organocatalysis with excellent temporal control. We introduce a new paradigm for controlling the reaction profile by using perturbations to the CDI &#8220;mask&#8221;, instead of the NHC. Three test reactions are compared to present practical considerations for designing and choosing appropriate masks.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are powerful organocatalysts, but practical applications often require in situ generation from stable precursors that &#8220;mask&#8221; the NHC reactivity via reversible binding. Previously established &#8220;masks&#8221; are often simple small molecules, such that the NHC structure is used to control both catalytic activity and activation temperature, leading to undesirable tradeoffs. Herein, we show that NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (CDI) adducts can be masked precursors for switchable organocatalysis and that the CDI substituents can control the reaction profile without changing the NHC structure. Large electronic variations on the CDI (e.g., alkyl versus aryl) drastically change the catalytically active temperature, whereas smaller perturbations (e.g., different para&#8208;substituted phenyls) tune the catalyst release within a narrower window. This control was demonstrated for three classic NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions, each influencing the NHC&#8208;CDI equilibrium in different ways. Our results introduce a new paradigm for controlling NHC organocatalysis as well as present practical considerations for designing appropriate masks for various reactions.

         <title>Intermolecular Formal Cycloaddition of Indoles with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes by Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular formal cycloaddition of indoles with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes promoted by commercially available Lewis acids has been disclosed, allowing one&#8208;step rapid construction of rigid indoline polycyclic structures via a cascade nucleophilic addition and Mannich reaction process.







Abstract
Herein, we develop a new approach to directly access architecturally complex polycyclic indolines from readily available indoles and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) through formal cycloaddition promoted by commercially available Lewis acids. The reaction proceeded through a stepwise pathway involving a nucleophilic addition of indoles to BCBs followed by an intramolecular Mannich reaction to form rigid indoline&#8208;fused polycyclic structures, which resemble polycyclic indole alkaloids. This new reaction tolerated a wide range of indoles and BCBs, thereby allowing the one&#8208;step construction of various rigid indoline polycycles containing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers.

         <title>Synthesis of Neocaesalpin A, AA, and Nominal Neocaesalpin K
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoids neocaesalpin A, AA and nominal neocaesalpin K was achieved through use of a redox&#8208;flexible platform as key intermediate. We delineate an approach that enables novel late&#8208;stage oxidation of a furfuryl acetate under mild conditions to furnish the characteristic butenolide found in the neocaesalpins.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoid neocaesalpin A (1) is disclosed. At the heart of the synthesis lies an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that rapidly assembles the target framework from commercial materials. A carefully orchestrated sequence of oxidations secured the desired oxygenation pattern. Late&#8208;stage release of the characteristic butenolide occurred through a novel mercury(II)&#8208;mediated furan oxidation. Successful extension of the route allowed preparation of neocaesalpin AA (2) as well as nominal neocaesalpin K (3) and suggested structural revision of neocaesalpin K, leading to the hypothesis that the two are likely the same natural product with correct assignment as 2.

         <title>Sulfonium Salt Reagents for the Introduction of Deuterated Alkyl Groups in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile deuterated reagents, namely, dn&#8208;alkyl sulfonium salts, dn&#8208;alkyl halides, a dn&#8208;alkyl azide, and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine, were prepared and used to efficiently introduce dn&#8208;alkyl groups into drug candidates and their analogues with complex skeletons. A liver microsomal metabolism study using 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone as a model compound revealed a significant deuterium kinetic isotope effect due to the installed d2&#8208;ethoxy group.







Abstract
The pharmacokinetics of pharmaceutical drugs can be improved by replacing C&#8722;H bonds with the more stable C&#8722;D bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms, which is a typical metabolic site for cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, the application of deuterated synthons is limited. Herein, we established a novel concept for preparing deuterated reagents for the successful synthesis of complex drug skeletons with deuterium atoms at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms. (dn&#8208;Alkyl)diphenylsulfonium salts prepared from the corresponding nondeuterated forms using inexpensive and abundant D2O as the deuterium source with a base, were used as electrophilic alkylating reagents. Additionally, these deuterated sulfonium salts were efficiently transformed into dn&#8208;alkyl halides and a dn&#8208;alkyl azide as coupling reagents and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine as a nucleophile. Furthermore, liver microsomal metabolism studies revealed deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE) in 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone. The present concept for the synthesis of deuterated reagents and the first demonstration of a KIE in a d2&#8208;ethoxy group will contribute to drug discovery research based on deuterium chemistry.

         <title>Bismuth in Radical Chemistry and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas indications of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds can be traced back to the 19th century, the preparation and characterization of both transient and persistent bismuth&#8208;radical species has only been established in recent decades. These advancements led to the emergence of the field of bismuth radical chemistry, mirroring the progress seen for other main&#8208;group elements. The seminal and fundamental studies in this area have ultimately paved the way for the development of catalytic methodologies involving bismuth&#8208;radical intermediates, a promising approach that remains largely untapped in the broad landscape of synthetic organic chemistry. In this review, we delve into the milestones that eventually led to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field of radical bismuth chemistry. Our focus aims at outlining the intrinsic discoveries in fundamental inorganic/organometallic chemistry and contextualizing their practical applications in organic synthesis and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Main&#8208;chain Macromolecular Hydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazones &#8211; consisting of a dynamic imine bond and an acidic NH proton &#8211; have recently emerged as versatile photoswitches underpinned by their ability to form thermally bistable isomers, (Z) and (E), respectively. Herein, we introduce two photoresponsive homopolymers containing structurally different hydrazones as main&#8208;chain repeating units, synthesized via head&#8208;to&#8208;tail Acyclic Diene METathesis (ADMET) polymerization. Their key difference lies in the hydrazone design, specifically the location of the aliphatic arm connecting the rotor of the hydrazone photoswitch to the aliphatic polymer backbone. Critically, we demonstrate that their main photoresponsive property, i.e., their hydrodynamic volume, changes in opposite directions upon photoisomerization (&#955; = 410 nm) in dilute solution. Further, the polymers &#8211; independent of the design of the individual hydrazone monomer &#8211; feature a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) by close to 10 &#176;C. The herein established design strategy allows to photochemically manipulate macromolecular properties by simple structural changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Carbonylation of Alkenes: Selective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Linear and Branched Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented regiodivergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of aromatic alkenes has been developed. Utilizing commercially available Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 in the presence of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenediyl&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphine) ligand L8 diverse selenoesters are obtained in a straightforward manner. Key to success for the control of the regioselectivity of the carbonylation step is the concentration of the acidic co&#8208;catalyst. This general protocol features wide functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the presence of stoichiometric amounts of acid changes the properties and coordination mode of the ligand leading to reversed regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement Enables A Triple Functionalization of&#160;Gem&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes: An Unusual Fluorolactonization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report in this paper a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory gem&#8208;fluorolactonization of ene&#8208;carboxylic acids. Reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (1.0 mol%) at room temperature affords fluorolactones in good to excellent yields. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Methylenecycloalkanyl)acetic acids are transformed to bridged fluorolactones under identical conditions. One C&#8208;C, one C&#8208;O and one tertiary C&#8208;F bond were generated along the gem&#8208;disubstituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in this operationally simple transformation. Trapping experiments indicates that the reaction is initiated by a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation followed by Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8208;F bond forming reductive elimination cascade. Post&#8208;transformations of these fluorolactones taking advantage of the electrophilicity of the 1&#8208;fluoroalkylcarboxylate function are also documented.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of C&#8208;O Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8208;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8208;O axis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via atroposelective esterification of dialdehyde&#8208;containing diaryl ethers. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8208;O axially chiral compounds. The temperature dependency and preliminary investigations on the racemization barrier of C&#8208;O bonds are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Acylimidazoles via Dehydrogenative Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with nonactivated hydrocarbons through C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization is both extremely promising and notably challenging, especially when attempting to achieve enantioselectivity using iron&#8208;based catalysts. We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes. The readily available and tunable N,N&#162;&#8208;dioxide catalysts of iron in connection with oxidants exhibit precise asymmetric induction (up to 99% ee) with good compatibility in moderate to good yields (up to 88% yield). This protocol provides an elegant and straightforward access to optically active acyclic carbonyl derivatives starting from simple alkanes without prefunctionalization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control expriments were made to gain insight into the nature of C&#8211;C bond formation and the origin of enantioselectivity. We propose a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling process enabled by the immediate interconversion between chiral ferric species and ferrous species.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;d Electron Synergy in LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu Intermetallics Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fact that d&#8208;band center theory links the d electron structure of transition metals to their catalytic activity, it is yet unknown how the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons impacts catalytic performance. Herein, novel LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu intermetallics containing 5d, 4d, and 3d electrons were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity. The optimized LaNi0.5Co0.5Ru has an overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Beyond offering a variety of new electrocatalysts, this work reveals the multi&#8208;d electron synergy in promoting catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2) Annulation of 4&#8208;Acetoxy Allenoate with Aldimine Enabled by AgF&#8208;Assisted P(III)/P(V) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine with the assistance of AgF is described. The success of this reaction hinges on the metathesis between enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion and AgF, leading to a key intermediate comprising silver enolate and fluorophosphorane P(V)&#8208;moiety. The former is able to undergo Mannich reaction with aldimine while the latter initiates a cascade sequence of AcO&#8208;elimination/aza&#8208;addition, thus furnishing the P(III)/P(V) catalysis. By taking advantage of the silver enolate, a preliminary attempt at asymmetric variant was conducted with the combination of achiral phosphine catalyst and chiral bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine ligand (PyBox), giving moderate enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Oxide as A New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) offers an efficient and sustainable approach for direct conversion of widespread nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrate (NO3&#8208;) under mild conditions, representing a promising alternative to the traditional approach that involves harsh Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald oxidation processes. Unfortunately, due to the weak absorption/activation of N2 and the competitive oxygen evolution reaction, the kinetics of NOR process is extremely sluggish accompanied with low Faradaic efficiencies and NO3&#8208; yield rates. In this work, an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched perovskite oxide with nonstoichiometric ratio of strontium and ruthenium (denoted as Sr0.9RuO3) was synthesized and explored as NOR electrocatalyst, which can exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency (38.6%) with a high NO3&#8208; yield rate (17.9 &#956;mol mg&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). The experimental results show that the amount of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 is greatly higher than that of SrRuO3, following the same trend as their NOR performance. Theoretical simulations unravel that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 can render a decreased thermodynamic barrier toward the oxidation of *N2 to *N2OH at the rate&#8208;determining step, leading to its enhanced NOR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Propargyl&#8208;Aryl Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions between propargylic electrophiles and aryl nucleophiles is a well&#8208;established method to build enantioenriched benzylic alkynes. Here, a catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8722;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. Propargylic chlorides were treated with aryl iodides as well as heteroaryl iodides in the presence of a chiral nickel complex, and manganese metal was used as a stoichiometric reductant, allowing for the construction of a propargyl C&#8722;aryl bond under mild conditions. An alternative dual nickel/photoredox catalytic protocol was also developed for this cross&#8208;electrophile coupling in the absence of a metal reductant. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Arylation of Pyridines via Zincke Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An arylation protocol for pyridines is described, via the ring&#8208;opened Zincke intermediate. Treatment of pyridines with triflic anhydride and a secondary amine produces an azahexatriene species, which undergoes regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation at the putative C4 position. Recyclization then provides the pyridine products. Alternatively, metal&#8208;free arylation with a diaryliodonium salt is selective for the pyridine meta&#8208;position, affording a regiodivergent approach to pyridine biaryls from a common intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted Mg&#8208;CO2 Batteries by Amide&#8208;Mediated CO2 Capture Chemistry and Mg2+&#8208;Conducting Solid&#8208;electrolyte Interphases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mg&#8208;CO2 battery has been considered as an ideal system for energy conversion and CO2 fixation. However, its practical application is significantly limited by the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of CO2 cathode and Mg anode. Here, a new amide mediated chemistry strategy is proposed to realize a highly reversible and high&#8208;rate Mg&#8208;CO2 battery in conventional electrolyte. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical computation unveiled that the introduced amide could simultaneously modify the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to accelerate CO2 cathodic reactions on the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic levels and facilitate the formation of Mg2+&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to enable highly reversible Mg anode. As a result, the Mg&#8208;CO2 battery exhibits boosted stable cyclability (70 cycles, more than 400 h at 200 mA g&#8208;1) and high&#8208;rate capability (from 100 to 2000 mA g&#8208;1 with 1.5 V overpotential) even at &#8208;15 &#8451;. This work opens a newly promising avenue for advanced metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly aesthetically captivating structures can be formed by tuning the length or flexibility of various components. The self&#8208;assembly of an elongated rigid terphenyl&#8208;based tetra&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L1) with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor produces an [M12L16]24+ triangular orthobicupola structure (1).

The inherent flexibility of ligand L2 might be the key factor behind the formation of the thermodynamically stable and unique 'intertwined cubic structure' in this scenario.

         <title>Prediction of Early Atherosclerotic Plaques using a Sequence&#8208;Activated Fluorescence Probe for the Simultaneous Detection of &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl Transpeptidase and Hypobromous Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atherosclerosis is a lipoprotein&#8208;driven disease, and there is no effective therapy to reverse of atherosclerosis or existing plaques, therefore, it is urgently necessary to create a noninvasive and reliable approach for early atherosclerosis detection to prevent initial plaque formation. Atherosclerosis is intimately associated with inflammation, which was accompanied by excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cells requiring more glutathione (GSH) to resist severe oxidative stress. Therefore, the GSH&#8208;hydrolyzed protein&#160;&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and the ROS&#8208;hypobromous acid (HBrO) are potential biomarkers for predicting atherogenesis. Hence, to avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence&#8208;activated double&#8208;locked TP fluorescent probe, C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzed the probe. By utilization of C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, the voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.</dc:description>

Hence, to avoid false-positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence-activated double-locked TP fluorescent probe, C-HBrO-GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzed the probe. By utilization of C-HBrO-GGT, the voltage-gated chloride channel (CLC-1)-HBrO-catalase (CAT)-GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Capturing Doublet Intermediate&#160;Emitters by Chemically Crosslinking Confinement towards Spatiotemporal Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoluminescence is one of the most meticulous ways to manipulate light energy. Typical photoluminescent emitters are mostly stable substances with a pure photophysical process of spontaneous photon&#8208;emission from their excited states. Intermediate emitters are elusive attributing to their synchronous energy transfer process including photophysical and incomplete photochemical pathways. An intermediate emitter containing radicals is more difficult to be observed due to its inherent chemical reactivity. Here, these challenges are overcome by spontaneously formed space limitations in polymer crosslinking networks meanwhile chemically&#8208;active intermediates are captured. These doublet intermediates exhibit unique long&#8208;wavelength emissions under chemically crosslinking confinement conditions, and their luminous mechanism provides a novel perspective for designing intermediate emitters with liquid crystal characters and photoresponsive features towards spatiotemporal encryption, promising for the detection of photochemical reactions and the development of fascinating luminescent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving the High Capacity and High Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) based on Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three&#8208;dimensional foam&#8208;structured GaN&#8208;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high&#8208;performance SSB based on Co&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53 &#937; cm2 and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000 h at 0.1&#8208;0.2 mA cm&#8208;2. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200 cycles at 0.2C (~100%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96 mV/cycle to only 0.66 mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (~170mAh g&#8208;1 at 1C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte&#8208;based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance LRMO&#8208;based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high&#8208;energy density SSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensionally Arranged Quantum&#8208;Dot Superstructures Guided by a Supramolecular Polymer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit important photophysical properties, such as long&#8208;range energy diffusion, miniband formation, and collective photoluminescence, when aggregated into well&#8208;defined superstructures, such as three&#8208;dimensional (3D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices. However, the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) QD superstructures, which have a simpler arrangement, is challenging; therefore, the photophysical properties of 1D&#8208;arranged QDs have not been studied previously. Herein, we report a versatile strategy to obtain 1D&#8208;arranged QDs using a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. SP is composed of self&#8208;assembling cholesterol derivatives with two amide groups for hydrogen bonding and a carboxyl group as an adhesion moiety on the QDs. Upon mixing SP and dispersed QDs in low&#8208;polarity solvents, the QDs self&#8208;adhered to the SP and self&#8208;arranged into 1D superstructures via van der Waals interactions between the surface organic ligands of the QDs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we revealed the efficient photoinduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the 1D&#8208;arranged QDs via an in&#8208;depth analysis of the emission spectra and decay curves.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Barcoded Plasmonic Nanostructures for Activity&#8208;Based Protease Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a new class of protease activity sensors called DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes are comprised of gold nanoparticles functionalized with peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates (GPDs), where the peptide is a substrate of the protease of interest. The DNA acts as a barcode identifying the peptide and facilitates signal amplification. Protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage frees the DNA from the nanoparticle surface, which is subsequently measured via a CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based assay as a proxy for protease activity. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show activity&#8208;based, multiplexed detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;associated protease, 3CL, and the apoptosis marker, caspase 3, with high sensitivity and selectivity. GPDs yield &gt;25&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals, 100&#8208;fold improved response compared to commercial probes, and detection limits as low as 58 pM at room temperature. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of proteases can be detected visually by leveraging the aggregation&#8208;dependent color change of the gold nanoparticles. We showcase the clinical potential of GPDs by detecting a colorectal cancer&#8208;associated protease, cathepsin B, in three different patient&#8208;derived cell lines. Taken together, GPDs detect physiologically relevant concentrations of active proteases in challenging biological samples, require minimal sample processing, and offer unmatched multiplexing capabilities (mediated by DNA), making them powerful chemical tools for biosensing and disease diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in 2D Chalcogenides: Structural Origin and Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unusual set of anomalous functional properties of rocksalt crystals of Group IV chalcogenides were recently linked to a kind of bonding termed as metavalent bonding (MVB) which involves violation of the 8&#8208;N rule. Precise mechanisms of MVB and the relevance of lone pair of group IV cations are still debated. With restrictions of low dimensionality on the possible atomic coordination, 2D materials provide a rich platform for exploration of MVB. Here, we present first&#8208;principles theoretical analysis of the nature of bonding in five distinct 2D lattices of group IV chalcogenides MX (M: Sn, Pb, Ge and X: S, Se, Te), in which the natural out&#8208;of&#8208;plane expression of the lone pair versus in&#8208;plane bonding can be systematically explored.&#160; While their honeycomb lattices respecting the 8&#8208;N rule are shown to exhibit covalent bonding, their square and orthorhombic structures exhibit MVB only in&#8208;plane, withcationic lone&#8208;pair activating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane structural puckering that controls their relative stability. Anomalies in Born&#8208;effective charges, dielectric constants, Gr&#252;neisen parameters occur only in their in&#8208;plane behaviour, confirming MVB is confined strictly to 2D and originates from p&#8208;p orbital interactions. Our work opens up directions for chemical design of MVB based 2D materials and their heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Feature Shape and Dimension of a Confinement Geometry on Selectivity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The local confinement effect, which can generate a high concentration of hydroxide ions and reaction intermediates near the catalyst surface, is an important strategy for converting CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon products in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Therefore, understanding how the shape and dimension of the confinement geometry affect the product selectivity is crucial. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the shape (degree of confinement) and dimension of the confined space on the product selectivity without changing the intrinsic property of Cu. We demonstrate that geometry influences the outcomes of products, such as CH&#8324;, C&#8322;H&#8324;, and EtOH, in different ways: the selectivity of CH4 and EtOH is affected by shape, while the selectivity of C2H4 is influenced by dimension of geometry predominantly. These phenomena are demonstrated, both experimentally and through simulation, to be induced by the local confinement effect within the confined structure.&#160;Our geometry model could serve as basis for designing the confined structures tailored for the production of specific products.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Opportunities for Rational Materials Design in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomedicines are extensively used in cancer therapy. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline organic porous materials with several benefits for cancer therapy, including porosity, design flexibility, functionalizability, and biocompatibility. This review examines the use of COFs in cancer therapy from the perspective of reticular chemistry and function&#8208;oriented materials design. First, the modification sites and functionalization methods of COFs are discussed, followed by their potential as multifunctional nanoplatforms for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy by integrating functional components. Finally, some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are presented with the hope of promoting the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines and bringing COFs closer to clinical trials.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Salt Template Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Porous Carbon for Fast Metal&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The water&#8208;soluble salt&#8208;template technique holds great promise for fabricating 3D porous materials. However, an equipment&#8208;free and pore&#8208;size controllable synthetic approach employing salt&#8208;template precursors at room temperature has remained unexplored. Herein, we introduce a green room&#8208;temperature antisolvent precipitation strategy for creating salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors to universally produce 3D porous materials with controllable pore size. Through a combination of theoretical simulations and advanced characterization techniques, we unveil the antisolvent precipitation mechanism and provide guidelines for selecting raw materials and controlling the size of precipitated salt. Following the calcination and washing steps, we achieve large&#8208;scale and universal production of 3D porous materials and the recycling of the salt templates and antisolvents. The optimized nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon (N&#8208;3DPC) materials demonstrate distinctive structural benefits, facilitating a high capacity for potassium&#8208;ion storage along with exceptional reversibility. This is further supported by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectra, in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The anode shows a high rate capacity of 181 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 A g&#8722;1 in the full cell. This study addresses the knowledge gap concerning the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of porous materials, thereby expanding their potential applications for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrapermeable Gel Membranes Enabling Superior Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane technology is rapidly gaining broad attraction as a viable alternative for carbon capture to mitigate increasingly severe global warming. Emerging CO2&#8208;philic membranes have become crucial players in efficiently separating CO2 from light gases, leveraging their exceptional solubility&#8208;selectivity characteristics. However, economic and widespread deployment is greatly dependent on the boosted performance of advanced membrane materials for carbon capture. Here, we design a unique gel membrane composed of CO2&#8208;philic molecules for accelerating CO2 transportation over other gases for ultrapermeable carbon capture. The molecular design of such soft membranes amalgamates the advantageous traits of augmented permeation akin to liquid membranes and operational stability akin to solid membranes, effectively altering the membrane&#8217;s free volume characteristics validated by both experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Surprisingly, gas diffusion through&#160;free&#8208;volume&#8208;tuned gel membrane undergoes a&#160;9&#8208;fold improvement without compromising&#160;separation factor for the superior solubility selectivity of CO2&#8208;philic materials, and&#160;CO2 permeability achieves a groundbreaking record of 5608 Barrer surpassing the capabilities of non&#8208;facilitated CO2 separation materials and exceeding the upper bound line established in 2019 even by leading&#8208;edge porous polymer materials. Our designed gel membrane can maintain exceptional separation performance during prolonged operation, enabling the unparalleled potential of solubility&#8208;selective next&#8208;generation materials towards sustainable carbon capture.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Fused Dimerized Acceptor for Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency and High Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized electron acceptor has been successfully synthesized and subsequently incorporated as the third component in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Diverging from the traditional dimerized acceptors with a linear configuration, this novel electron acceptor displays a distinctive "butterfly&#8208;like" structure, comprising two Y&#8208;acceptors as wings fused with a pyrene&#8208;based backbone. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and the electron&#8208;donating nature of pyrene enable the new acceptor to show low solubility, elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels. Consequently, the new dimerized acceptor seamlessly integrates as the third component into ternary OSCs, enhancing electron transporting properties, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss, and elevating open&#8208;circuit voltage. These merits enable the ternary OSCs to show an exceptional efficiency of 19.07%, a marked improvement compared to the 17.6% attained in binary OSCs. More importantly, the high Tg exhibited by the pyrene&#8208;fused electron acceptor helps to stabilize the morphology of the photoactive layer thermal&#8208;treated at 70 &#176;C, retaining 88.7% efficiency over 600 hours. For comparison, binary OSCs experience a decline to 73.7% efficiency after the same duration. These results indicate that the &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; design and the incorporation of a pyrene unit is a promising strategy in the development of dimerized electron acceptors for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphosphine Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chelate&#8208;Assisted Inner&#8208;Selective Migratory Hydroarylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise control of the regioselectivity in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydrofunctionalization of alkenes remains a big challenge. With a transient ketimine directing group, the nickelcatalyzed migratory &#946;&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl ketones has been realized with aryl boronic acids using alkyl halide as the mild hydride source for the first time. The key to this success is the use of a diphosphine ligand, which is capable of the generation of a Ni(II)&#8208;H species in the presence of alkyl bromide, and enabling the efficient migratory insertion of alkene into Ni(II)&#8208;H species and the sequent rapid chain walking process. The present approach diminishes organosilanes reductant, tolerates a wide array of complex functionalities with excellent regioselective control. Moreover, this catalytic system could also be applied to the migratory hydroarylation of alkenyl azahetereoarenes, thus providing a general approach for the preparation of 1,2&#8208;aryl heteroaryl motifs with wide potential applications in pharmaceutical discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Carbonized Polymer Dots with Color&#8208;tunable Time&#8208;dependent Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Confining Carboxyl Dimer Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a facile strategy to realize fine&#8208;tuning of phosphorescence color in time&#8208;dependent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is essential but both theoretically and practically rarely exploited. Through simultaneously confining carboxyl dimer association and isolated carboxyl into the particle via a simple hydrothermal treatment of polyacrylic acid, a dual&#8208;peak emission of red phosphorescence (645 nm) and green phosphorescence (550 nm) was observed from carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The ratio of the two luminescent species can be well regulated by hydrochloric acid inhibiting the dissociation of carboxyl to promote hydrogen bond. Due to comparable but different lifetimes, color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP with color changing from yellow to green or orange to green were obtained. Based on the crosslinking enhanced emission effect, the phosphorescence visible time was even extended to 7 s through introducing polyethylenimide. This study not only proposes a novel and facile method for developing CPDs with color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP, but also provides a bran&#8208;new non&#8208;conjugated red phosphorescence unit and its definite structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Dormancy and double&#8208;activation strategy for construction of high&#8208;performance mixed&#8208;matrix membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have the potential for energy&#8208;efficient gas separation by matching the superior mass transfer and anti&#8208;plasticization properties of the fillers with processability and scaling up features of the polymers. However, construction of high&#8208;performance MMMs has been prohibited due to low filler&#8208;loading and the existence of interfacial defects. Here, high MOF&#8208;loaded, i.e., 55 wt%, MMMs are developed by a &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; (DDA) strategy. High MOF precursor concentration suppresses crystallization in the membrane casting solution, realizing molecular level mixing of all components. Then, the polymeric matrix was formed with uniform encapsulation of MOF nutrients. Subsequently, double&#8208;activation was employed to induce MOF&#160;crystallization;&#160;the alkali promotes MOFs nucleation to harvest small porous nanocrystals while excessive ligands activate the metal ions to enhance the MOFs conversion. As such, quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous mass transfer channels can be formed in the MMMs by the connected MOFs nanocrystals to boost the gas permeability. The optimized MMM shows significantly ameliorated CO2 permeability, i.e., 2841 Barrer, five&#8208;fold enhancement compared with pristine polymer membrane, with a good &#160;CO2/N2 selectivity of 36. Besides, the nanosized MOFs intensify their interaction with polymer chains, endowing the MMMs with good anti&#8208;plasticization behaviour and stability, which advances practical application of MMMs in carbon capture.</dc:description>
