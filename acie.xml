         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Functionalized Atomically Precise Metal Clusters Exhibit Synergistically Enhanced Performance for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of organometallic compounds with metal nanoparticles can, in principle, generate hybrid nanocatalysts endowed with augmented functionality, presenting substantial promise for catalytic applications. Herein, we synthesize an atomically precise metal cluster (Ag9Cu6) catalyst integrated with alkynylferrocene molecules (Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc). This hybrid catalyst design facilitates a continuous electron transfer channel via an ethynyl bridge and establishes a distinctive local chemical environment, resulting in remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction. The Ag9Cu6&#8208;Fc catalyst achieves a record&#8208;high product selectivity of CO Faradaic efficiency of 100% and an industrial&#8208;level CO partial current density of &#8211;680 mA/cm2, surpassing the performance of the Ag9Cu6 cluster (62% and &#8211;230 mA/cm2, respectively) without ferrocene functionalization in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Operando experimental and computational findings offer valuable insights into the role of ferrocene functionalization in synergistically improving the catalytic performance of metal clusters, propelling the advancement of metallic&#8208;organometallic hybrid nanoparticles for energy conversion technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn Doping at High&#8208;Activity Octahedral Vacancies of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysis in Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 with the intrinsic cation vacancies is an ideal substrate for heteroatom doping into the highly active octahedral sites in spinel oxide catalysts. However, it is still a challenge to confirm the vacancy location of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 through experiments and obtain enhanced catalytic performance by preferential occupation of octahedral sites for heteroatom doping. Here, a Mn&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 incorporated with carbon nanotubes catalyst was developed to successfully achieve preferential doping into highly active octahedral sites by employing &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 as the precursor. Further, the vacancy in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 was only located on octahedral sites rather than tetrahedral ones, which was first proved by direct experimental evidence through the clarification doping sites of Mn. Notably, the catalyst shows outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82 V and 0.64 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as the maximum power density of 179 mWcm&#8722;2 and 403 mWcm&#8722;2 for Mg&#8208;air batteries and Al&#8208;air batteries, respectively. It could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the doping Mn on octahedral sites and the substrate &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 along with the modification of the adsorption/desorption properties for ORR oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates as well as the optimization of the reaction energy barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Doping Copper(I) in Ag7 Cluster for Circularly Polarized OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency of 26.7%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hetero&#8208;metal doping or substitution to create alloy clusters is a highly appealing strategy for improving physicochemical characteristics as well as tailoring optical and electronic properties, although high&#8208;yield synthesis of alloy clusters with precise positioning of doped metals is a daunting challenge. Herein, we manifest rational synthesis of chiral alloy cluster enantiomers R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu in 85%&#8208;87% yield by replacing one Ag(I) atom with Cu(I) in homometallic clusters R/S&#8208;Ag7, achieving circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a quantum yield beyond 90%. As a small energy gap (ca. 0.07 eV) between S1 and T1 states facilitates thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), the photoluminescence (PL) of R/S&#8208;Ag7 and R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu at ambient temperature originates mostly from TADF (85% and 86%) in place of phosphorescence (15% and 14%). Relative to those of R/S&#8208;Ag7, copper(I) doping not only triples PL quantum yields of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu due to accelerating intersystem crossing&#160;and RISC, but also doubles CPL asymmetry factors of R/S&#8208;Ag6Cu ascribed to rigidizing cluster structure through stronger Ag&#8208;Cu interaction apart from dramatically improving thermodynamic stability. Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.7%, which is superior to most of red&#8208;emitting OLEDs through solution process.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8203;Industry&#8208;Level Electrocatalytic CO2 to CO Enabled by 2D Mesoporous Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N&#8208;doped carbon framework via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7 nm) with well&#8208;distributed 5 to 40 nm&#8208;width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0 wt.%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, an industry&#8208;level current density of 446 mA cm&#8208;2 with &gt; 95% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50&#8208;hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100% accessibility and expedited mass transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Integrated with Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling desalination with electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging approach to simultaneously addressing freshwater scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the salt removal rate in such processes is slow, and the applicable water sources are often limited to those with high salt concentrations. Herein, we show high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic desalination by coupling with electrochemical CO2 reduction using a carbon catalyst. A ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon catalyst embedded with Cu nanoparticles delivers a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.3% for CO production at 288 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1. The efficient CO2 electroreduction generates high current densities, which drive fast salt ion transfer across ion exchange membranes. The integrated device enables one of the quickest salt removal rates of 1043.49 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 among various desalination methods. Drinking water can be obtained with an ion removal rate of 99% when natural seawater is used as the water source.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conductive Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Ribbon with High&#8208;Density Redox&#8208;Active Centers as Cathode for Stable High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) materials hold significant potential as cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their flexible structural design, high electronic conductivity, and independence from costly resources. However, their practical application is often limited by their capacity and cyclability. In this study, we report a one&#8208;dimensional Cu&#8208;MOF (DDA&#8208;Cu, DDA=1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination ribbon and high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers, making it a stable, high&#8208;capacity cathode for LIBs. The &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8208;O&#8323;N motifs embedded within the ribbon not only serve as redox&#8208;active centers for enhanced lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity but also contribute to structural robustness, enabling resistance against electrode solubility in organic electrolytes, thus ensuring superior cyclability. Furthermore, these &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8208;O&#8323;N units promote efficient charge transfer, leading to high electronic conductivity at room temperature. These advantageous properties allow the Cu&#8208;MOF cathode to deliver a remarkable capacity (353 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1) and exceptional cyclability, achieving capacity retention of 78% after 1000 cycles, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF electrodes. Additionally, this DDA&#8208;Cu demonstrates considerable wettability with the electrolyte, achieving outstanding performance even when tested in a lean electrolyte environment (2 &#956;L mg&#8208;1) with a high mass loading of the MOF (6.8 mg cm&#8208;2)</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conductive Cu-based metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF) materials hold significant potential as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their flexible structural design, high electronic conductivity, and independence from costly resources. However, their practical application is often limited by their capacity and cyclability. In this study, we report a one-dimensional Cu-MOF (DDA-Cu, DDA=1, 5-Diamino-4, 8-dihydroxy-9, 10-anthraceneedione) featuring extended &#960;-d conjugated coordination ribbon and high-density redox-active centers, making it a stable, high-capacity cathode for LIBs. The &#960;-d conjugated Cu-O&#8323;N motifs embedded within the ribbon not only serve as redox-active centers for enhanced lithium-ion storage capacity but also contribute to structural robustness, enabling resistance against electrode solubility in organic electrolytes, thus ensuring superior cyclability. Furthermore, these &#960;-d conjugated Cu-O&#8323;N units promote efficient charge transfer, leading to high electronic conductivity at room temperature. These advantageous properties allow the Cu-MOF cathode to deliver a remarkable capacity (353 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1) and exceptional cyclability, achieving capacity retention of 78% after 1000 cycles, surpassing state-of-the-art MOF electrodes.

         <title>Boosting Adsorption and Selectivity of Acetylene by Nitro Functionalisation in Copper(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purification and storage of acetylene (C2H2) are important to many industrial processes.  The exploitation of metal &#8211;organic framework  (MOF) materials to address the balance  between selectivity for C2H2 vs  carbon dioxide (CO2 ) against maximising uptake of C2H2 has attracted much interest.  Herein, we report that the synergy between unsaturated copper (II) sites and functional groups, fluoro (&#8208;F), methyl (&#8208;CH3), nitro (&#8208;NO2) in a series of isostructural MOF materials MFM&#8208;190(R) that show exceptional adsorption and selectivity of C2H2 . At 298 K, MFM&#8208;190(NO2) exhibits an C2H2  uptake of  216 cm3 g&#8722;1  (320  cm3 g&#8722;1 at 273 K ) at 1.0 bar and a high selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (up to ~150 for v/v = 2/1) relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream. Dynamic breakthrough studies validate and confirm the excellent separation of C2H2/CO2 by  MFM&#8208;190(NO2) under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction reveals the cooperative binding, packing and selectivity of C2H2 by unsaturated Cu(II) sites and free &#8208;NO2 groups.</dc:description>

         <title>mPatch: a wearable hydrogel microneedle patch for in vivo optical sensing of calcium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents an in vivo optical hydrogel microneedle platform that measures levels of analytes in interstitial fluid. The platform builds on a previously published technique for molding hydrogel microneedles by developing a composite hydrogel (i.e., PEGDA and polyacrylamide) that is sufficiently stiff to penetrate skin in the hydrated state and whose fluorescence changes dynamically&#8212;via a conjugated aptamer&#8212;depending on level of analyte. In a demonstration relevant to hypercalcemia, the hydrogel microneedle distinguished varying concentrations of calcium (within a range of 0 to 2 mM, which spans physiologically meaningful variations for hypoparathyroidism) within 10 minutes. In rats, a compact CMOS sensor measuring fluorescence from microneedles distinguished low hypercalcemic (1.7 mM) from high hypercalcemic (2.3 mM) ionized calcium levels as determined from reference blood measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates in vivo feasibility of a concept&#8212;which we call mPatch&#8212;for an optical hydrogel microneedle to measure small changes in levels of analytes in interstitial fluid, which does not rely on extraction of interstitial fluid out of the dermis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical C&#8208;H oxidation reactions offer a sustainable route to functionalize hydrocarbons, yet identifying suitable substrates and optimizing synthesis remain&#160;challenging. We report an integrated approach combining machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to streamline the exploration of electrochemical C&#8208;H oxidation reactions. Utilizing a batch rapid screening electrochemical platform, we evaluated a wide range of reactions, initially classifying substrates by their reactivity, while LLMs text&#8208;mined literature data to augment the training set. The resulting ML models for reactivity prediction achieved high accuracy (&gt;90%) and enabled virtual screening of a large set of commercially available molecules. To optimize reaction conditions for selected substrates, LLMs were prompted to generate code that iteratively improved yields. This human&#8208;AI collaboration proved effective, efficiently identifying high&#8208;yield conditions for 8 drug&#8208;like substances or intermediates. Notably, we benchmarked the accuracy and reliability of 10 different LLMs &#8208;&#160;including LLaMA, Claude, and GPT&#8208;4 &#8208;&#160;on generating and executing codes related to ML based on natural language prompts given by chemists to showcase their tool&#8208;making (code generation) and tool&#8208;use (function calling) capabilities and potentials for accelerating research across four diverse tasks. We also collected an experimental benchmark dataset comprising 1071 reaction conditions and yields for electrochemical C&#8208;H oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal as Template: Reversing the Synthesis Logic in the Preparation of Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conventional synthetic approach to transition metal pincer complexes calls for the preparation of the tridentate pincer (proto)ligand first, with subsequent introduction of the transition metal center as the last step. This work demonstrates that the alternative synthetic logic, where the central main group element is introduced last, can be applicable to a number of PEP pincer complexes (E = B, Al, Si, P) derived from phosphinophenols and phosphinopyrroles. This approach obviates the need to isolate well&#8208;behaved proto&#8208;pincer precursors, and instead relies on the formation of phosphine&#8208;metal adducts first, whose nature determines the stoichiometry of the needed main group reagent to complete the synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#173;&#173;&#173;&#8211;Squeeze Triggers Guest Desorption from Sponge&#8211;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release. We here report an unprecedented molecular&#8211;squeeze triggered guest release behavior from sponge&#8211;like macrocycle crystals. The crystals function as typical sponge to include guest molecules within their microscopic voids that are adaptively formed, thus acting as adsorbents for toluene/pyridine separations. Intriguingly, vaporized ethyl acetate (  EA  ) molecules trigger the guest release from the crystals without entering the pores or voids of the crystals to replace the guests. Instead, they work as external forces applied directly onto the crystals themselves, &#8216;&#8216;squeezing&#8221; the materials to close the voids through supramolecular interactions between  EA  and macrocycles on the crystal surface and release the guest molecules. Various experimental techniques as well as molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism of the molecular&#8211;squeeze induced guest release procedure. The  EA  &#8211;regenerated crystals can be recycled multiple times without the loss of separation performance. Compared with conventional guest release procedure, this method is manipulated in a mild condition, showing the potential in saving cost and energy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Dynamic Hydrogen Isotope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entropy&#8208;driven strategy enables the systematic design of complex systems by using entropy as a quantifiable design parameter for the degree of mixing. In this study, we present mixed&#8208;linker zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, that features two types of six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) with aperture sizes of 3.4 &#197; and 1.7 &#197;. By adjusting the configurational entropy, the ratio of these 6MRs can be systematically controlled, which significantly influences adsorptive properties, particularly improving the H2 affinity about 3 times throughout the series. This results in the significant enhancement of retention times in dynamic separation of hydrogen isotopes (D2/H2), even over LNG liquefaction temperature.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Entropy-driven strategy enables the systematic design of complex systems by using entropy as a quantifiable design parameter for the degree of mixing. In this study, we present mixed-linker zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), sod-ZIF-1 series, that features two types of six-membered rings (6MRs) with aperture sizes of 3.4 &#197; and 1.7 &#197;. By adjusting the configurational entropy, the ratio of these 6MRs can be systematically controlled, which significantly influences adsorptive properties, particularly improving the H2 affinity about 3 times throughout the series. This results in the significant enhancement of retention times in dynamic separation of hydrogen isotopes (D2/H2), even over LNG liquefaction temperature. This approach to entropy-driven pore engineering provides new opportunities for enhancing gas adsorption and separation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Electron Transfer in Copper&#8208;Mediated C(sp2)&#8208;H Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes supported by pyridinedicarboxamide ligand (L) as a platform for investigating the role of electron transfer in C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation. While the copper(II) trifluoromethyl complex is unreactive towards (hetero)arenes, the formal copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex performs C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of a wide range of (hetero)arenes. Mechanistic studies using the copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex suggest that the mechanism of arene trifluoromethylation is substrate&#8208;dependent. When the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer is high, the reaction proceeds through a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, where an initial electron transfer occurs between the substrate and oxidant prior to CF3 group transfer. Otherwise, a CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism is followed. These studies provide valuable insights into the role of strong oxidants and potential mechanistic dichotomy in Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8208;H trifluoromethylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Diffusion and Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film via Reducing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;step deposition method effectively mitigates the efficiency decline observed in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPVSCs) with increasing cell area, stemming from film in&#8208;homogeneity. However, the high solubility of SnI2 in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction&#8208;diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second&#8208;step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction&#8208;diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8208;1.38 to &#8208;10.10 kcal/mol between ligands and Sn2+ significantly enhances the effectiveness of two&#8208;step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large&#8208;scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68% for 0.04 cm2 device and 11.30% for 1 cm2 device among tin&#8208;based perovskite devices in two&#8208;step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study lays the groundwork for the potential scale&#8208;up development of lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second-step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction-diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from -1.38 to -10.10 kcal/mol between ligands and Sn2+ significantly enhances the effectiveness of two-step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large-scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68% for 0.04 cm2 device and 11.30% for 1 cm2 device among tin-based perovskite devices in two-step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Asymmetric Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Unidirectional Low&#8208;Friction Water Collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Friction plays a pivotal role in many phenomena of physical chemistry and has long been in the focus of research thereof. As a crucial parameter, frictions in membranes&#8217; inner and/or outer surface&#160;can be minimized to&#160;reduce&#160;solvent inlet pressure and enlarge inner pore fluid flux, ideally reaching&#160;near frictionless transport of water at nanoscale. Inspired by the leaf structure of Tillandsia, a porous membrane with a rough surface and a hydrophilic inlet together with hydrophobic pore channels was designed and fabricated, based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Combined with COFs&#8217; inherent highly oriented pore structures, the&#160;as&#8208;made&#160;asymmetric membranes through chemical etching can minimize the solvent critical intrusion pressure and&#160;enable&#160;inner pore low friction water transport. Ultimately, obtained COF membranes succeeded in&#160;trapping&#160;fog from air and achieved a water harvesting rate&#160;(WHR) of 1570 mg cm&#8208;2&#160;h&#8208;1, together with small molecular pollutants filtrated&#160;off&#160;in the meantime. Intriguingly, the synthesized asymmetric COF membranes illustrated unidirectional low friction water collecting and transporting features, the successful imitation of T. macdougallii. This work presents&#160;a&#160;practical strategy to construct functional porous membranes for low friction water collection and transport,&#160;and created a model paradigm to&#160;design fluid transporting pore channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Cage&#8208;Confined Cations Molecular Dynamics toward High&#8208;Tc Perovskite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;confinement effect that imposes great constriction on the dynamic behaviors of guest molecules is an established platform for tailoring physical properties. Herein, the strategy of enhancing cage&#8208;confinement effect to control molecular motion has been probed for the first time to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics of 2D hybrid perovskites. By fine&#8208;tailoring of the confined cations inside the perovskite cavities, we have successfully obtained new homologous ferroelectrics of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Cl10 (1; BA =n&#8208;butylamine, MA = methylamine) and (BA)2(EA)2Pb3Cl10 (2; EA = ethylamine). Intriguingly, this dynamics modulation of cage&#8208;confined cations leads to a remarkable promotion of Curie temperature (Tc), boosting from 340 K (for 1) to 402 K (for 2). In situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations on energy barrier confirm that the larger EA cation in 2 is subject to stronger confinement effect, of which potential energy barrier of molecular motion is ~3.5 times that of MA cation. This dynamic behavior greatly suppresses the dynamic motions of EA cation, while MA cation can easily accelerate motion and reach a fast motion limit, thus accounting for an enhancement of Tc (&#916;T~62 K) in 2. The finding sheds light on the understanding of cage&#8208;confined electric orders and the precise design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Axially Chiral Sulfilimines Enabled by Anionic Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient enantioselective coupling reaction between sulfenamides and cyclic diaryliodonium salts is established via adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis, precisely synthesizing a broad range of axially chiral sulfilimines with excellent enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and chemoselectivities (67 examples under same conditions, up to 98% ee). The following thermodynamically controlled pyramidal inversion enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers. Mechanistic studies suggest that anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III) complexes serve as counteranions of diaryliodonium and anionic ligand of Cu(I) catalyst simultaneously, which could be regarded as an explanation for outstanding selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Configuration&#8208;Mediated Efficient Non&#8208;Radiative Transition for R848&#8208;Assisted Photothermal Immunotherapy to Inhibit Tumor Growth and&#160;Metastasis by An&#160;In Situ Tumor Vaccine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer metastasis remains a critical factor contributing to the current limitations in cancer treatment. Photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a safe and potent therapeutic approach, demonstrating the capability to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. While researchers have extensively investigated various structural modifications to enhance photothermal conversion performance, the influence of molecular configuration has received comparatively limited attention. In this study, we synthesized two isomers, CZTBT and LVTBT, which possessed distinct configurations. LVTBT, characterized by a flatter molecular configuration, exhibited an extended absorption wavelength and a higher molar extinction coefficient. Its excited state facilitated stronger rotation for non&#8208;radiative transitions, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.3%. When combined with R848, LVTBT@R848 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;mediated photothermal immunotherapy functioned as an in situ tumor vaccine, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cell infiltration, and the differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells and memory T cells, thereby activating the strong immune response. Consequently, it significantly inhibited the growth of both primary and distant tumors, while also limiting lung metastasis. In summary, this study proposed a configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition strategy for efficient photothermal immunotherapy, advancing the frontiers of organic photothermal agents (OPTAs) design and synthesis.</dc:description>

Its excited state facilitated stronger rotation for non-radiative transitions, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.3%. When combined with R848, LVTBT@R848 nanoparticles (NPs)-mediated photothermal immunotherapy functioned as an in situ tumor vaccine, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cell infiltration, and the differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells and memory T cells, thereby activating the strong immune response. Consequently, it significantly inhibited the growth of both primary and distant tumors, while also limiting lung metastasis. In summary, this study proposed a configuration-mediated non-radiative transition strategy for efficient photothermal immunotherapy, advancing the frontiers of organic photothermal agents (OPTAs) design and synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Strategy to Enhance Long&#8208;Range Order of Poly(Heptazine Imide) Nanorods for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), one of the crystalline or long&#8208;range ordered allotropes of polymeric carbon nitride, is a promising polymeric photocatalyst; however, preparation of highly crystalline PHI remains a challenge. Herein, through a bottom&#8208;up strategy involving repair of structural defects and increase of specific surface area of melon precursor, we prepared PHI nanorods with dramatically improved long&#8208;range order. The resulting PHI exhibited a shift of product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction from CO to CH4 with a high methanation activity in contrast to the pristine PHI with relatively low long&#8208;range order. The improvement of long&#8208;range order for PHI remarkably enhanced the separation efficiency and transfer dynamics of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption capacity for *CO intermediate. This study revealed the relationship between the precursor structure and PHI crystal growth in ionothermal synthesis, and also showcased the great potential of highly crystalline PHI in artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8211;Vibration Coupling via Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minimizing energy loss is crucial for breaking through the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). The main mechanism of energy loss can be attributed to non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) that occurs due to exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. To tackle this challenge,  tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is strategically utilized to tailor novel fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Upon comprehensive analysis of both theoretical and experimental results, this approach can effectively enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, reduce exciton reorganization energy, and weakens exciton&#8722;vibration coupling strength. Consequently, the binary OSC device based on Y&#8208;SeSe, which features dual strong intramolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent interactions, achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.49%, accompanied by an extremely small &#916;Enr of 0.184 eV, much lower than those of Y&#8208;SS and Y&#8208;SSe based devices with weaker intramolecular noncovalent interactions. These achievements not only set an efficiency record for selenium&#8208;containing OSCs, but also mark the lowest reported &#916;Enr value among high&#8208;performance binary devices. Furthermore, the ternary blend device showcases a remarkable PCE of 20.51%, one of the highest PCEs for single&#8208;junction OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of intramolecular noncovalent interactions in suppressing exciton&#8211;vibration coupling, thereby achieving low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mutual Dependence between Membrane Phase Separation and Bacterial Division Protein Dynamics in Synthetic Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell membranes in bacteria are laterally polarized to produce specific environments for membrane proteins, e.g., proteins involved in cell division which accumulate at mid&#8208;cell or the cell poles. An interesting result of such membrane&#8208;lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane&#8208;bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinC, MinD, MinE, FtsA and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle&#8208;based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, Min proteins exhibit preferential binding and macro&#8208;scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase&#8208;separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase&#8208;separated GUVs leads to blebbing&#8208;like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.</dc:description>

         <title>In/Outside Catalytic Sites of the Pore Walls in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore channels play a decisive for mass transport in catalytic systems. However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under&#8208;explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8211;Cl breaking and potential&#8208;induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside&#8208;channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside&#8208;channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Freezing&#160;Effect on Electron Conduction&#160;of Ball&#8208;milled Lanthanum Trihydride&#160;for Superionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A recent finding shows that lattice deformation could transform the mixed&#160;electronic/hydride (H&#8208;)&#160;conducting&#160;lanthanum trihydride (LaH3) to a superionic H&#8208;&#160;conductor. Such a feature would enable the development of a&#160;brand&#8208;new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state hydride ion battery. It is essential to elucidate the mechanism of such a phenomenon. Here, we disclose&#160;an abnormal freezing&#160;effect&#160;on the electronic conductivity (&#963;e) of the ball&#8208;milled&#160;LaH3;&#160;that is, &#963;e&#160;can be lowered by over 2&#160;orders of magnitude upon a low&#8208;temperature treatment. Low&#8208;temperature Raman&#160;reveals&#160;that at low temperatures, lattice deformation has a noticeable influence on the interaction of hydrogen at octahedral&#160;(Ho) and&#160;tetrahedral (Ht)&#160;sites, which may play a crucial role in hindering electron conduction. This freezing&#160;effect&#160;can significantly improve the ionic transfer number of rare earth&#8208;based H&#8208;&#160;conductors and provide a new direction to the development of solid electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>CO&#8208;tolerant heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts for efficient formic acid dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of improved and less costly catalysts for dehydrogenation of formic acid (HCOOH) is of general interest for renewable energy technologies involving hydrogen storage and release. Theoretical calculations reveal that ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon should be appropriate catalysts for such transformations. It is predicted that nitrogen doping significantly decreases the formation of CO, but at the same time increases CO tolerance of the catalysts. To prove these hypotheses heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts supported on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Rux/CN) with hierarchical structure were synthesized using carbon nitride (C3N4) as template and phenanthroline (Phen) as ligand. Experimental tests in HCOOH dehydrogenation revealed the optimal catalyst Ru7/CN exhibiting good thermal stability and a high turnover frequency (TOF &gt; 1300 h&#8208;1), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the commercial Ru5/C catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Hidden Photoisomerization of a Symmetric Phosphaalkene Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the synthesis and analysis of a novel, air&#8208;stable, and solvent&#8208;resistant phosphaalkene switch. Using this symmetric switch, we have demonstrated degenerate photoisomerization experimentally for the first time. With a combination of photochemical&#8208;exchange NMR spectroscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the isomerization mechanism of this symmetric phosphaalkene. Our findings highlight the critical role of the isolobal analogy between C=P and C=C bonds in governing nanoscale molecular motion and break new ground for our understanding of light&#8208;induced molecular processes in symmetric heteroalkene systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Monodisperse Chemical Oligophosphorylation of Peptides via Protected Oligophosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylation are recently discovered post&#8208;translational modifications that remain poorly characterized due to (1) the difficulty of extracting endogenously polyphosphorylated species without degradation and (2) the absence of synthetic and analytical tools to prepare and characterize poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylated species in biochemical contexts. Herein, we report a methodology for the selective oligophosphorylation of peptides with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (Pn = 3&#8211;6). A library of oligophosphorimidazolide (oligoP&#8208;imidazolide) reagents featuring benzyl and o&#8208;nitrophenylethyl protecting groups were synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (65&#8211;93%). These oligoP&#8208;imidazolide reagents enabled the selective and simultaneous conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphoryl nucleophiles, circumventing tedious iterative processes. The generalizability of this approach is illustrated by a substrate scope study that includes several biologically relevant phosphopeptide sequences, culminating in the synthesis of &gt;60 examples of peptide oligophosphates (Pn = 2&#8211;6). Moreover, we report the preparation of oligoP&#8208;diimidazolides (Pn = 3&#8211;5) and discuss their application in generating unique condensed phosphate&#8208;peptide conjugates. We also demonstrate that human phospho&#8208;ubiquitin (pS65&#8208;Ub) is amenable to functionalization by our reagents. Overall, we envision the methods described here will enable future studies that characterize these newly discovered but poorly understood phosphorylation modes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Pd2L4 Capsules from Readily Accessible Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s Base Ligands Inducing Circular Dichroism on Fullerenes C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The induction of chirality on pristine fullerenes through non&#8208;covalent embedding in an asymmetric nano&#8208;confinement has only been rarely reported. Bringing molecules with such a unique electronic structure and broad application range into a chiral environment is particularly appealing for the development of chiroptical materials, enantioselective photoredox catalysts and systems showing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we report the formation of a chiral, configurationally stable Pd2L4&#160;capsule assembled from a&#160;C2&#8208;symmetric, &#8216;ribbon&#8208;shaped&#8217; ligand with a Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base naphthalimide (TbNaps) backbone, easily synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds. Embedding chirality directly into the ligand backbone ensures a relatively lightweight receptor design whose aromatic panels create a strongly shielded inner cavity of about 700 &#197;3&#160;volume. Fullerenes C60&#160;and C70, as well as a pair of corannulenes, can be bound in acetonitrile (where unsubstituted fullerenes are insoluble) and X&#8208;ray structures of host&#8208;guest complexes were obtained. Tight interactions between the chiral host and the fullerene guests leads to the induction of a circular dichroism (CD) on the characteristic absorption bands of the forbidden &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transitions of the fullerenes, backed up by sTDA TD&#8208;DFT calculations and detailed investigation of the electronic excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>A Generally Applicable Method for Disentangling the Effect of Individual Noncovalent Interactions on the Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce the fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) scheme for precise quantification of individual interactions contributing to the binding energy of arbitrary chemical entities, such as protein&#8208;ligand binding energies, lattice energies of molecular crystals, or association energies of large biomolecular assemblies. Using fp&#8208;LED, we can assess whether the contribution to the binding energy arising from noncovalent interactions between pairs of molecular fragments in any chemical system is attractive or repulsive, and accurately quantify its magnitude at the coupled cluster level &#8208; commonly considered as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of computational chemistry. Such insights are crucial for advancing molecular and material design strategies in fields like catalysis and therapeutic development. Illustrative applications across diverse fields demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of this theoretical framework, promising profound implications for fundamental understanding and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Affecting Charges and Structures of {Bi6} Architectures by 12&#8208;Electron Transition Metal Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron count affects the shape of Bi6q&#8722; units, from a regular prism in Bi62&#8722; (left) to a regular crown&#8208;type cycle in Bi66&#8722; (right). Such units were previously isolated in the coordination sphere of metal complexes, while the (less symmetric) intermediate with a &#8722;4 charge has only been predicted by theory. In their Research Article (e202417234), Florian Weigend, Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. isolated the Zintl cluster [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; (center), in which two 12&#8208;electron fragments are perfectly suited to stabilize the boat&#8208;type Bi64&#8722; unit, as confirmed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for Precise Control of Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space conjugation in a series of tetraphenylalkanes&#8208;based nonconjugated clusteroluminogens is engineered via high&#8208;pressure structural regulation. Abnormal blue shift and remarkable emission enhancement are realized, exhibiting distinct structural factors. Intense white&#8208;light emission is realized after high&#8208;pressure treatment, disrupting the typical excited&#8208;state even&#8208;odd effects in ambient study.







Abstract
Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Different from the through&#8208;bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminophores, through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)&#8208;based CLgens at molecular level. High&#8208;pressure exploration enables accurate manipulation of clusteroluminescence and elucidates the intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationships involved. Upon initial compression, the predominant molecular distortions marked by increased interfacial angles between benzene rings diminish TSC, resulting in anomalous hypochromatic shift in emission. Subsequently, considerable structural contraction enhances TSC and suppresses molecular motion, resulting in a pronouncedly enhanced and bathochromic&#8208;shifted emission. Notably, a series of TPAs&#8208;based CLgens exhibit intense white&#8208;light emission upon pressure release, attributed to irreversible structural distortion and destruction. This study not only advances the understanding of CLgens, but also underscores the crucial structural factors for effective TSC control, paving the way for establishing new photophysical theories for aggregate science.

&lt;p&gt;Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;-conjugated molecules. Different from the through-bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;-conjugated luminophores, through-space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)-based CLgens at molecular level.

         <title>Hydrogen Radical Enabling Industrial&#8208;Level Oxygen Electroreduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enhanced two&#8208;electron ORR performance was achieved by a rationally designed system incorporating cobalt (II) clusters onto oxidized carbon nanotube composites. This enhancement is attributed to the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites and high local proton availability, and enables effective conversion of ethylene glycol to oxalic acid by coupling with an electro&#8208;Fenton process.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and water, powered by renewable electricity, provides a highly attractive alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive autoxidation process presently used in industry, but much remains unknown about this two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR), especially the local proton effect. Here, we have investigated the function of hydrogen&#8208;associated intermediates in the 2e&#8208;ORR using a rationally designed cooperative electrode material with cobalt (II) clusters embedded onto the oxidized carbon nanotube composites (Co&#8208;OCNT). We found that the local proton availability can determine both the reaction kinetics and selectivity. A 2e&#8208;ORR process involving hydrogen radical transfer is confirmed. Specifically, the carbon sites from the OCNTs promote proton production, and the cobalt sites from the Co cluster facilitate ORR intermediate formation. The high local proton availability and the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites both contribute to the superior reaction kinetics and selectivity of the Co&#8208;OCNT, reaching an H2O2 production rate of ~40.6&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 90&#8201;% at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Further cascading the 2e&#8208;ORR with the electro&#8208;Fenton process shows a high selectivity of oxalic acid up to 97&#8201;% for the valorization of ethylene glycol.

         <title>Spatial and Temporal Visualization of Polymorphic Transformations in Pharmaceutical Tablets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) has been used to reveal pressure&#8208;induced phase transformations in pharmaceutical tablets of glycolide as a function of compaction pressure. Temporal analysis of the tablets, and subsequent identification using electron diffraction, revealed a hydrolysis reaction occurred on storage of the tablets. This reaction was enhanced in the presence of microcrystalline cellulose.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) represents a cutting&#8208;edge method for non&#8208;destructive material analysis, offering the unique capability of providing molecular&#8208;level information with spatial resolution. In this study, we have applied XRD&#8208;CT to investigate pharmaceutically relevant tablets that have been subjected to a range of compression pressures typical in tablet manufacturing. By employing XRD&#8208;CT to pharmaceutical tablets, we reveal material changes without tablet destruction, thereby avoiding potential phase transformations during sample preparation that could lead to errors in the interpretation of the processes that have occurred. Utilizing a pressure&#8208;sensitive marker, glycolide, we have tracked changes within tablet structures induced by compression, pinpointing locations where glycolide undergoes pressure&#8208;induced transformation. Additionally, we conducted a follow&#8208;up study with analysis one month later, observing an in situ hydrolysis reaction of glycolide within the tablets. Through the complementary use of electron diffraction, we have elucidated the structure of the hydrolysis product, further enhancing our understanding of temporal changes in the tablets.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Integrated Electrocatalyst on Oxygen Conversion for Highly Durable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrocatalyst (Co3O4/CoNGDY) with integrated Janus structure for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is in situ constructed through a self&#8208;organized method. The active sites and mechanism are confirmed by in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Aqueous zinc&#8208;air batteries with ultra&#8208;long stability and recoverable modularized cylindrical solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries are achieved.







Abstract
Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key for clean energy applications such as rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts have been the focus of great attention by scientists. Here, an innovative and continuous growth method is established to fabricate integrated Janus structure Co3O4/CoNGDY catalyst, which can work for bifunctional oxygen catalytic conversion, achieving highly durable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Embedded in the hydrangea&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY), the Co3O4/CoNGDY is self&#8208;organized by CoNGDY at the NGDY contact sites and Co3O4 at the upper part, in which Co3O4 works as OER catalyst and CoNGDY acts as ORR catalyst. Due to the incomplete charge transfer within integrated structure, NGDY reduces the d&#8208;band center of the Co sites, so the adsorption strength of intermediates is balanced, and the catalytic activity for ORR/OER is increased. The Co3O4/CoNGDY can serve as an efficient air electrode of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. The rechargeable Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based aqueous zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrate excellent performance with a high specific capacity of 746.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extremely long lifetime of more than 5000&#8197;hours. The recoverable modularized cylindrical Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries with a power density of up to 167.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved.

         <title>Triflic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amination of 2&#8208;Arylethanols with Weak N&#8208;Nucleophiles in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic deoxyamination of 2&#8208;arylethanols in hexafluoroisopropanol, which directly installs various amino groups, including sulfonamides, amides, ureas and anilines. The transformation relies on the intermediacy of a phenonium ion, whose formation was rationalized by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The catalytic deoxyamination of readily available 2&#8208;arylethanols offers an appealing, simple, and straightforward means of accessing &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines of biological interest. Yet, it currently represents a great challenge to synthetic chemistry. In most cases, the alcohol has to be either pre&#8208;activated in situ or converted into a reactive carbonyl intermediate, limiting the substrate scope for some methods. Examples of direct dehydrative amination of 2&#8208;arylethanols are thus still scarce. Here, we describe a catalytic protocol based on the synergy of triflic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol, which enables the direct and stereospecific amination of a broad array of 2&#8208;arylethanols, and does not require any pre&#8208;activation of the alcohol. This approach yields high value&#8208;added products incorporating sulfonamide, amide, urea, and aniline functionalities. In addition, this approach was applied to the sulfidation of 2&#8208;arylethanols. Mechanistic experiments and DFT computations indicate the formation of phenonium ions as key intermediates in the reaction.

Mechanistic experiments and DFT computations indicate the formation of phenonium ions as key intermediates in the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Building functional fluorophores from a simple scaffold. In their Research Article (e202415627), Lei Zhang, Su Jing, Thorben Cordes, and co&#8208;workers use the Ugi&#8208;4&#8208;component reaction to assemble fluorogenic dye molecules that selectively localize to mitochondria or lysosomes. The multifunctional fluorophores are not only fluorogenic but also induce pyroptosis in living cancer cells. The study shows the potential of scaffold&#8208;based synthesis for creation of new functional fluorophores.

         <title>Nonenzymatic Hydration of Phosphoenolpyruvate: General Conditions for Hydration in Protometabolism by Searching Across Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a novel search strategy, we identified common mild nonenzymatic conditions for all hydration reactions in gluconeogenesis and the rTCA cycle and for the retro&#8208;aldol cleavage of citrate, advancing the search for an environment conducive to the nonenzymatic emergence of a protometabolism.







Abstract
Numerous reactions within metabolic pathways have been reported to occur nonenzymatically, supporting the hypothesis that life arose upon a primitive nonenzymatic precursor to metabolism. However, most of those studies reproduce individual transformations or segments of pathways without providing a common set of conditions for classes of reactions that span multiple pathways. In this study, we search across pathways for common nonenzymatic conditions for a recurring chemical transformation in metabolism: alkene hydration. The mild conditions that we identify (Fe oxides such as green rust) apply to all hydration reactions of the rTCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, including the hydration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 2&#8208;phosphoglycerate (2PGA), which had not previously been reported under nonenzymatic conditions. Mechanistic insights were obtained by studying analogous substrates and through anoxic and radical trapping experiments. Searching for nonenzymatic conditions across pathways provides a complementary strategy to triangulate conditions conducive to the nonenzymatic emergence of a protometabolism.

         <title>Allosteric CDC37 Inhibitor Disrupts Chaperone Complex to Block CDK4/6 Maturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allosterically targeting CDC37 by small molecule inhibitor DDO&#8208;6079 disrupts protein&#8208;protein interaction of HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;CDK4/6, thus to decrease thermal stability of CDK6 and reverse drug resistance of CDK4/6 inhibitors without HSR.







Abstract
Cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) is a member of the molecular chaperone family and acts as a cochaperone of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is overexpressed in many cancer types as a regulator of protein kinase maturation. In this process, CDC37 selectively recognizes and stabilizes protein kinases by forming a HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex. The protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) of HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;kinase complexes contribute to malignant tumors, as oncogenic kinases in malignant cells depend upon CDC37 expression. Thus, inhibiting CDC37 to disrupt HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex reveals as a promising way to achieve selective inhibition of oncogenic kinase maturation. Herein, we report a small&#8208;molecule CDC37 inhibitor called DDO&#8208;6079 that simultaneously inhibits HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;CDK4/6 chaperone complex by binding to an allosteric site on CDC37. DDO&#8208;6079 selectively inhibited the maturation of multiple oncogenic kinases to escape heat shock response (HSR). Furthermore, DDO&#8208;6079 decreased the thermostability of CDK6, reversed the resistance of CDK6 to palbociclib (a successful CDK4/6 inhibitor) in colorectal cancer cells and exhibited efficacy in vivo. Together, the results revealed that DDO&#8208;6079 is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule CDC37 inhibitor that disrupts the HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex and provides a new way to block kinase maturation.

         <title>Reversible and Ultrasensitive Detection of Nitric Oxide Using a Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework, copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2), has been obtained through strategic synthetic modification. The Cu3(HIB)2 device shows ultrasensitive, highly selective, reversible, and low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide. Mechanistic investigation reveals the contribution of Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) functionality of Cu3(HIB)2) for highly sensitive and reversible NO binding sites.







Abstract
This paper describes the use of a highly crystalline conductive 2D copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2) as an ultrasensitive (limit of detection of 1.8 part&#8208;per&#8208;billion), highly selective, reversible, and low power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide (NO) at room temperature. The Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;based sensors retain their sensing performance in the presence of humidity, and exhibit strong signal enhancement towards NO over other highly toxic reactive gases, such as NO2, H2S, SO2, NH3, CO, as well as CO2. Mechanistic investigations of the Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;NO interaction through spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory revealed that the Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) moieties serve as the binding sites for NO sensing, while the Ni&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) MOF analog shows no noticeable response to NO. Overall, these findings provide a significant advance in the development of crystalline metal&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid)&#8208;based conductive 2D MOFs as highly sensitive, selective, and reversible sensing materials for the low&#8208;power detection of toxic gases.

         <title>A Chlorine&#8208;Resistant Self&#8208;Doped Nanocarbon Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis in Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing seawater as an electrolyte enables efficient hydrogen peroxide production for coastal applications. The NO&#8208;DC700 catalyst, synthesized via pyrolysis of silk, achieves 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 H2O2 with a faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, offering a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective method for on&#8208;site production in coastal region.







Abstract
Developing seawater&#8208;compatible hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electroproduction technologies is crucial for advancing marine resource utilization in coastal regions. However, designing efficient and highly stable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in seawater environment remains a challenging task due to the corrosive and toxic nature of chloride ions (Cl&#8722;). Herein, we present, for the first time, a novel nitrogen and oxygen self&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon (NO&#8208;DC700) catalyst, derived from silk fiber, which addresses these challenges with low toxicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high adaptability. The obtained NO&#8208;DC700 catalyst demonstrates an impressive H2O2 production rate of up to 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a high Faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, and produces 4.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2 after 20&#8197;hours of stable operation, placing it among the highest&#8208;performing catalysts reported in neutral electrolytes. Theoretical calculations reveal that NO&#8208;DC700&#8242;s superior 2e&#8722; ORR performance is due to the synergistic effect of graphitic nitrogen and C&#8208;OH, which inhibits Cl&#8722; adsorption and promotes *OOH adsorption. Additionally, integrating 2e&#8722; ORR with Fenton&#8208;like technology enables rapid degradation of organic pollutants and effective inactivation of seawater algae, offering significant potential for mitigating coastal eutrophication and red tide pollution. This work provides valuable insights into H2O2 electrosynthesis in seawater solution and promises advancements in ocean&#8208;energy applications.

The NO-DC&lt;sub&gt;700&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, synthesized via pyrolysis of silk, achieves 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, offering a sustainable and cost-effective method for on-site production in coastal region.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing seawater-compatible hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electroproduction technologies is crucial for advancing marine resource utilization in coastal regions. However, designing efficient and highly stable non-noble metal catalysts for two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) in seawater environment remains a challenging task due to the corrosive and toxic nature of chloride ions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Herein, we present, for the first time, a novel nitrogen and oxygen self-doped defect-rich nanocarbon (NO-DC&lt;sub&gt;700&lt;/sub&gt;) catalyst, derived from silk fiber, which addresses these challenges with low toxicity, cost-effectiveness, and high adaptability. The obtained NO-DC&lt;sub&gt;700&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst demonstrates an impressive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of up to 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high Faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, and produces 4.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after 20&#8197;hours of stable operation, placing it among the highest-performing catalysts reported in neutral electrolytes. Theoretical calculations reveal that NO-DC&lt;sub&gt;700&lt;/sub&gt;&#8242;s superior 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR performance is due to the synergistic effect of graphitic nitrogen and C-OH, which inhibits Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and promotes *OOH adsorption. Additionally, integrating 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with Fenton-like technology enables rapid degradation of organic pollutants and effective inactivation of seawater algae, offering significant potential for mitigating coastal eutrophication and red tide pollution. This work provides valuable insights into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis in seawater solution and promises advancements in ocean-energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Declined S1 but Constant T1 Energy: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Triplet Blocking Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a new approach of &#916;EST modulation via the triplet blocking effect, achieving decreased S1 but constant T1 energy level. The conflict between small &#916;EST and large oscillator strengths is relieved. The results are crucial for fundamental photophysics as well as development of optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules have been widely investigated in organic light emitting diodes (OLED), organic lasing, etc. Small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and high radiative rate constants (kF) are highly desired to utilize triplet excitons efficiently and are beneficial to reduce efficiency roll&#8208;off of devices of OLED devices. The prevalent TADF molecules are via donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design, for which the decreasing of the &#916;EST is often at the expense of reducing the kF. Herein, we demonstrated a new &#916;EST modulation approach to construct TADF with high kF, based on triplet blocking effect, i.e., the extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of a triplet constrainer (IB) leads to a gradually red&#8208;shifted S1 but a constant T1 energy and therefore reduced &#916;EST controlled from monomer (IB), monomer&#8208;linker (IB&#8208;BF2), to dimer of IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. The natural transition orbital analysis indicates that S1 state is delocalized while T1 state is localized as confirmed by time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the &#916;EST is reduced from 0.60&#8197;eV, 0.46&#8197;eV to 0.25&#8197;eV, while keeping faster radiation rate (around 108&#8197;s&#8722;1) than that of conventional donor&#8208;acceptor molecules (106&#8764;107&#8197;s&#8722;1). As a result, the emission mechanisms are regulated from fluorescence for IB, phosphorescence/TADF dual emissions for IB&#8208;BF2 to TADF for IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. This paper proposed a new approach of &#916;EST modulation and a new type of TADF molecule with high radiation rate, which is crucial for fundamental photophysics as well as material science.

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfoximine&#8208;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes: Functionalizable, Tuneable and Cysteine&#8208;Selective Chiral Warheads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfoximine substituted bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are prepared in one&#8208;pot and then diversified through 3 vectors. N&#8208;Functionalization allows controlled variation in the electrophilicity of the BCB in strain release processes including in protein labelling under biocompatible conditions, and the proximal stereocenter allows stereoselective protein labelling.







Abstract
Electrophilic covalent warheads with appropriate reactivity and selectivity are crucial to the investigation of protein function and the discovery of therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of sulfoximine bicyclo[1.1.0] butanes (BCBs) as novel thiol reactive chiral warheads, achieved in one&#8208;pot from methylsulfoximines. Unusually the warhead can then be derivatized, keeping the BCB intact, over 3 vectors: i) sulfoximine N&#8208;modification instills a broad range of strain&#8208;release reactivity; ii) sp2&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions on aryl&#8208;BCB&#8208;sulfoximines allows direct diversification, and iii) functionalization of the BCB motif itself is achieved by metalation and trapping with electrophiles. The BCB sulfoximines are shown to react selectively with cysteine including in a protein model (CDK2) under biocompatible conditions. Preliminary data indicate suitability for chemoproteomic applications, and enantioselective cysteine&#8208;labelling. The reactivity of sulfoximine BCBs with electron withdrawing groups on nitrogen is comparable to acrylamides with low to moderate reactivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations, we inspected the molecular&#8208;scale impact that a benzotriazole&#8208;based 3D four&#8208;arm small molecule has on the local morphology and electronic properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 blends.

While the emergence of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 active layer re&#8208;energized the organic photovoltaic community, excessive aggregation of Y6 molecules induced by their strong intermolecular interactions has limited the performance of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs). Adding 3D multi&#8208;arm small&#8208;molecule acceptors is an effective strategy to inhibit such aggregation. However, to maximize OSC efficiency, these molecules should also contribute to the electronic processes. Here, by taking a benzotriazole&#8208;based 3D four&#8208;arm small molecule (i.e., SF&#8208;BTA1) as representative example, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations to examine the molecular&#8208;scale impact of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules on morphological characteristics (especially at the nanoscale) and electronic properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 blends. By considering the intermolecular packing distances, density, and patterns among PM6, Y6, and SF&#8208;BTA1 components, exciton transfer rates from SF&#8208;BTA1 to Y6 or PM6, charge transfer rates from Y6 or PM6 to SF&#8208;BTA1, electron/hole transfer rates among adjacent Y6/PM6 pairs, and radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes, we draw a comprehensive picture that describes how 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules improve morphological and electronic properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 blends and thus the OSC efficiency. Furthermore, successful rationalization of these aspects allows us to point out key requirements regarding the electronic properties of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules.

         <title>Dicyanocarbene&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Efficient Quinoidization for the Development of Fused N&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new quinoidization reaction has been developed based on 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile (DMSM). This reaction avoids the reliance on halogenated substrates and has unique reactivity to the electron&#8208;rich fused aromatics. Various new quinoidal compounds were synthesized, and one of them exhibits a high electron mobility up to 1.33&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Our results provide a new synthetic method to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Dicyanomethylene&#8208;terminated quinoidal materials are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring excellent electron mobilities and air stability. Traditional synthetic methods of these materials such as Takahashi reaction, require the use of expensive palladium catalyst and halogenated substrates. However, for electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, the poor stability after halogenation renders their halogenated derivatives unsuitable as reaction precursors. To address this issue, we present a new metal&#8208;free synthetic approach using 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile as the quinoidization reagent, which is successfully applied to various electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, leading to the corresponding quinoidal compounds with high yields up to 94&#8201;%. We proposed the reaction mechanism, and investigated the physical properties of four fused quinoidal materials based on highly electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, which are scarce to be synthesized by the traditional method. Furthermore, these fused quinoidal materials were utilized in field&#8208;effect transistors, achieving high electron mobilities up to 1.33&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. We provide an effective synthetic approach to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductors.

         <title>Enhancing Low&#8208;Concentration Electroreduction of NO to NH3 via Potential&#8208;Controlled Active Site&#8208;Intermediate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrode potential adjust the interaction between active sites and intermediates for enhancing NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion over VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x.







Abstract
Electronic defect states in catalysts are recognized as highly effective active sites for enhancing the low&#8208;concentration electroreduction of NO to NH3 (NORR). Their structures dynamically evolve with applied electrode potentials, allowing the active sites to adjust interactions with intermediates, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. However, the dynamic changes in these interactions under applied potentials remain poorly understood, hindering the design of more diverse electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we developed a strategy that unitizes electrode potential to control the interactions between active sites and intermediates over oxygen vacancy&#8208;modified TiO2 (VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x) to enhance NORR performance. By combining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art constant inner potential (CIP) DFT calculations with in situ (spectro)electrochemical measurements, we investigated how the electrode potential influences these interactions in NORR. The results clearly demonstrate that applying an external potential alters the spatial symmetry of degenerate orbitals of Ti3+ to facilitate the generation of key intermediates for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Therefore, the VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x catalyst exhibited superior NORR performance with a NH3 Faradaic efficiency up to 76.4&#8201;% and a high NH3 yield rate of 632.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;vol&#8201;% NO atmosphere, which is competitive with those of previously reported works under higher NO concentration (above 10&#8197;vol&#8201;%). Remarkably, the NORR process achieved a record&#8208;breaking NH3 yield of 2292.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under the same conditions. This study opens a new avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic activity by adjusting operating conditions, thereby transcending the limitations of material design.

         <title>Formally Zerovalent Bis(arene) Germylene Complexes of Zirconium and Hafnium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(arene) coordination compounds of zirconium and hafnium have been synthesized in high yield by 4e reduction of tetrachloride adducts with a germylene phosphine Lewis pair. A puckered coordination mode of an arene moiety is discussed based on structural and spectroscopic data. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized. Dimethylbutadiene reacts under formation of a cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand. This addition is reversible at room temperature in the zirconium case.







Abstract
Tetrachlorides of zirconium and hafnium form adducts&#8197;(2, 3) with an intramolecular germylene phosphine Lewis pair. Two electron reduction treating the adducts with [MesNacnacMg]2 gives the low&#8208;valent metal complexes&#8197;(4, 5) featuring &#951;6&#8208;Trip coordination at the Zr(II) and Hf(II) metal atom. Reduction of the M(II)&#8208;complexes gives the zerovalent metal complexes of zirconium&#8197;(6) and hafnium&#8197;(7), which have been structurally characterized. Two arene moieties and the germylene exhibit metal coordination. Puckered coordination of a P&#8208;phenyl unit was observed for both derivatives&#8197;6 and 7. Four electron reduction of a reaction mixture of metal tetrachloride with the germylene phosphine Lewis pair also gives the zerovalent complexes in good yield. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized treating the reduced metal complexes with carbon monoxide. Dimethylbutadiene shows a reaction with an arene moiety and the coordinated germylene ligand of the zerovalent complexes. A cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand are formed. For zirconium this reaction is reversible at room temperature.

         <title>Using a New Pt(II) Source to Make Pt(II) Lantern&#8208;Shaped Cages, Including Low&#8208;Symmetry, Heteroleptic, and Multicavity Examples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Pt(II) starting material is cheap and easy to make, with exceptional air stability. It was used to synthesise [Pt2L4]4+ lantern&#8208;shaped cages including their first heteroleptic, low&#8208;symmetry and multicavity examples.







Abstract
Current synthetic methods towards Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages involve the use of dry solvent, inert atmosphere, lengthy reaction times, and highly variable yields if isolated. Starting materials such as [Pt(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 suffer from a poor shelf&#8208;life, reducing the synthetic accessibility of various Pt(II) architectures. A new Pt(II) source (with varied counterions), [Pt(3&#8208;ClPy)4](X)2 (3&#8208;ClPy=3&#8208;chloropyridine, X=BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, NO3&#8722;), is developed and characterised, showing greatly enhanced shelf&#8208;life characteristics under ambient atmospheric conditions. Using this starting material, the assembly of Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages was completed in as little as 1.5&#8197;hours with wet solvent and ambient atmosphere. The first examples of low&#8208;symmetry, heteroleptic and multicavity Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages are reported using this approach. Attempts towards an M6L8 octahedron using a tritopic ligand instead generate an interesting M2L4 cage with unbound pyridyl arms. Ligands and cages are characterised by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography in some cases.

         <title>Precise Separation of Complex Ultrafine Molecules through Solvating Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoporous nanomaterials, with their proven potential for accurate molecular sieving, are of substantial interest in propelling sustainable membrane techniques. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are prominent due to their customizable isopores and chemistry. Still, the discrepancy in experimental and theoretical structures poses a challenge to developing COF membranes for molecular separations. Here, we report high&#8208;selectivity sieving of complex ultrafine molecules through solvating pore&#8208;to&#8208;pore&#8208;aligned two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes. Our structurally oriented membrane shows reversible interlayer expansion with intralayer shift in response to solvent exposure. This dynamic deformation induced by solvents leads to a reduction in the aperture of the membrane&#8217;s sieving pores, which correlates with the number of COF layers. The resultant membranes yield largely improved molecular selectivity to discriminate binary and trinary complex mixtures, exceeding the conventional COF membranes. The membrane&#8217;s robustness against solvents and physical aging permits extremely stable microporosity and reliable operation for over 3000 h. This exceptional performance positions our membrane as an alternative to enriching and purifying value&#8208;added chemicals, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tetrazine Amplification System for Visual Detection of Trace Analytes via Click&#8208;Release Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving visual detection of analytes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in complex mixtures remains a persistent challenge. While sophisticated techniques offer single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, practical hurdles remain, necessitating tailored signal amplification systems for direct visual detection. In this study, we develop a strategy for the visualized detection of tetrazine through a "click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle" (CROC) cascade amplification process. We systematically describe the construction and synthesis of this system, the kinetic process of click release, the kinetics of oxidation to tetrazine and its cascade amplification effect in trace amounts of tetrazine. This system is capable of amplifying the signal of tetrazine at a concentration as low as 2 nM by 105&#8208;fold, thereby providing a clearly visible purple signal. Finally, as proof of concept, we successfully apply this method to visually detect trace &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and Pd2+.</dc:description>

         <title>Locking up G&#8208;Quadruplexes with Light&#8208;Triggered Staples Leads to Increased Topological, Thermodynamic, and Metabolic Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) and intercalated motif (IM) structures enhances their stability, locks their topology, and increases enzymatic resistance while preserving biological activity. This method, applied to the Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) model and other G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, shows promise for future therapeutic applications, including more stable aptamers and molecular decoys in biological systems.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) are secondary, tetraplexed DNA structures abundant in non&#8208;coding regions of the genome, implicated in gene transcription processes and currently firmly recognised as important potential therapeutic targets. Given their affinity for human proteins, G4 structures are investigated as potential decoys and aptamers. However, G4&#8197;s tend to adopt different conformations depending on the exact environmental conditions, and often only one displays the specifically desired biological activity. Their less intensively studied counterparts, the elusive tetraplexed intercalated&#8208;motifs (IMs) are typically unstable at neutral pH, hampering the investigation of their potential involvement in a biological context. We herein report on a photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; such tetraplexed&#8208;structures, to increase their stability, lock their topology and enhance their enzymatic resistance, while maintaining biological activity. The chemical structure and topology of the stapled Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) was spectroscopically characterised and rationalised in silico. The method was then extended to other biologically relevant G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, hinting towards potential application of such stapled structures in a therapeutic context.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of 1,2&#8208;Dihydroazete Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exploration of 1,2&#8208;dihydroazetes in ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is reported. The 4&#8208;membered rings readily polymerized using the Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs 2nd generation initiator and maintained living chain&#8208;ends for block polymer synthesis. This study gives new insights into the reactivity and limitations of enamine derivatives in metathesis processes, while also offering a new approach to degradable metathesis materials with tunable properties.ROMP1,2&#8208;DihydroazeteDegradationRegio&#8208;selectivity







Abstract
Fischer carbenes have recently found great utility in the construction of degradable metathesis materials, but investigations have been limited to oxygen&#8208;containing enol ether monomers. Here, the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of 1,2&#8208;dihydroazetes is reported. The polymerization proceeds regioselectively, and the resulting molecular weights are targetable by adjusting the Grubbs initiator loading. Under acidic conditions, the resulting polymers degrade into 3&#8208;aminopropanal derivatives through hydrolysis of the recurring enamide motifs in the polymer backbone. Additionally, the underlying kinetics and thermodynamics of the polymerization were studied through DFT calculations to elucidate the origins of metathesis regioselectivity. This work further expands the suite of monomers available to generate degradable metathesis materials and provides a flexible platform for target applications.

         <title>Distinctive Photomechanical Shape Change of p&#8208;Phenylenediacrylic Acid Dimethyl Ester Single Crystals Induced by a Spatially Heterogeneous Photoreaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester in single crystals were examined, revealing a reaction front propagation from the edge to the center. As the photoreaction progresses, the crystal undergoes a distinctive shape transformation, changing from a parallelogram to a distorted &#8220;fluttering flag&#8221; shape and eventually becoming a rectangle. Density functional theory calculations predict the post&#8208;reaction crystal structure, explaining this unique shape change through the spatially heterogeneous nature of the photoreaction.







Abstract
Understanding photoreaction dynamics in crystals is important for predicting the dynamic property changes accompanying these photoreactions. In this work, we investigate the photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester (p&#8208;PDAMe) in single crystals that show reaction front propagation, in which the photoreaction proceeds heterogeneously from the edge to the center of the crystal. Moreover, we find that p&#8208;PDAMe single crystals exhibit a distinctive crystal shape change from a parallelogram to a distorted shape resembling a fluttering flag, then to a rectangle as the photoreaction proceeds. Density functional theory calculations predict the crystal structure after the photoreaction, providing a reasonable explanation of the distinctive crystal shape change that results from the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction. These results prove that the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction dynamics have the ability to induce novel crystal shape changes beyond what would be expected based on the equilibrium reactant and product crystal shapes.

         <title>An Interstitial Boron Inserted Metastable Hexagonal Rh Nanocrystal for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable hexagonal Rh nanocrystal catalyst is synthesized via interstitial boron insertion for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The insertion of boron atoms into Rh lattice not only induces phase transition from face&#8208;centered cubic to hexagonal close&#8208;packed, but also optimized adsorbed behaviors of reaction intermediates, leading to improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks and enhanced HOR performance.







Abstract
Constructing metastable phase structure plays an important role in changing the physicochemical properties and improving the catalytic performance of nanocrystals. Unfortunately, the synthesis of metastable phase metallic nanocrystals is highly challenging, mainly due to the thermodynamically unstable ground&#8208;state. Here, we report a synthesis of unconventional metastable hexagonal rhodium nanocrystal (Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C) via interstitial boron insertion. The insertion of boron atoms into the interstitial sites of cubic Rh lattice not only induces the atomic arrangements from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), but also stabilizes the metastable hexagonal Rh structure. Benefiting from the phase transition and interstitial boron doping, the Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.413&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;gPGM&#8722;1. Experimental measurements including in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strengthened adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface of Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C is responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and increased water proportions in the gap region in the electric double layers. As a result, the increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network facilitate high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen transfer across the interface, thereby boost the alkaline HOR performance.

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Phosphonylation via Dual Photo and Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for direct benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H phosphonylation of non&#8208;specialized alkylarenes is reported. This dehydrogenative C&#8722;P bond formation method features high step economy and takes place under mild reaction conditions, which enables good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via intermolecular hydrogen atom abstraction and operates by a radical pathway.







Abstract
Alkyl phosphonates are important motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet their efficient synthesis by direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization remains a challenge. Here, we report straightforward access to benzylic phosphonates by direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization in a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling reaction between non&#8208;specialized alkylarenes and unfunctionalized phosphites. Notably, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as the limiting reagents. The scope of benzylic C&#8722;H substrates is broad, and the mild reaction conditions allow for good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway rather than the cationic pathway followed for specialized benzylic C&#8722;H substrates in previous methods.

Azatriangulenetrione unit is first incorporated into COF backbone to form a high&#8208;performance COF electrode with intrinsic multiple reachable redox&#8208;active sites of C=O, C=N and C=C, which delivers a superb discharge capacity of 410.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in SIBs.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from sluggish kinetics, large volume change, and limited specific capacity due to the large radius of Na+. These issues can be solved through using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as electrodes. Herein, an azatriangulenetrione&#8208;containing COF (denoted as CityU&#8208;33) was designed and synthesized as an electrode material for SIBs. Due to its inherent abundance of multiple redox&#8208;active sites and fast intercalation kinetics, CityU&#8208;33 delivered a high discharge capacity of 410.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and showed remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a discharge capacity of 288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97&#8201;% retention over 2000&#8197;cycles was achieved, making it the top COF electrode material for SIBs.

         <title>Shielding Fluoride Ion Basicity through Diurea Coordination for Nonaqueous Fluoride Shuttle Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong basicity of fluoride ions leads to detrimental side reactions on organic cations and solvents, converting &#8220;naked&#8221; F&#8722; into bifluoride (HF2&#8722;) ions. In this work, dual 1,3&#8208;diphenylurea (DPU) ligands shield the Lewis basicity of F&#8722; through hydrogen bonding, providing long&#8208;term chemical stability across a wide range of aprotic solvents and sustaining improved electrochemical performance in nonaqueous fluoride ion batteries.







Abstract
The strong basicity of fluoride ions leads to detrimental nucleophilic attack on organic components in the electrolytes, such as &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination reactions with organic cations and solvents, converting &#8220;naked&#8221; F&#8722; into corrosive and unstable bifluoride (HF2&#8722;) ions. These reactions significantly constrain the choice of suitable solvents and salts to develop electro(chemical) stable fluoride ion electrolytes. In this work, we replaced the triple water ligands typically present in industrial organic fluoride salts with dual 1,3&#8208;diphenylurea (DPU) coordination via hydrogen bonding interaction. This modification successfully suppressed the Lewis basicity of fluoride ions, providing long&#8208;term chemical stability (over 1000&#8197;hours) across a wide range of aprotic solvents, a broadened electrochemical stability window (&#8722;2.5&#8211;0.9&#8197;V vs. Ag+/Ag) and high ionic conductivity (1.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. Additionally, the weaker hydrogen bonding in F&#8722;&#8208;DPU coordination, compared to the conventional boron&#8208;based anion acceptor (AA) strategy that relies on intensive Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, facilitates faster (de)fluorination kinetics at the electrode. The proposed room temperature fluoride ion batteries sustain improved electrochemical performance by pairing with the Pb&#8208;PbF2 anode and BiF3 or Ag cathode.

In this work, we replaced the triple water ligands typically present in industrial organic fluoride salts with dual 1,3-diphenylurea (DPU) coordination via hydrogen bonding interaction. This modification successfully suppressed the Lewis basicity of fluoride ions, providing long-term chemical stability (over 1000&#8197;hours) across a wide range of aprotic solvents, a broadened electrochemical stability window (&#8722;2.5&#8211;0.9&#8197;V vs. Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ag) and high ionic conductivity (1.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at room temperature. Additionally, the weaker hydrogen bonding in F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-DPU coordination, compared to the conventional boron-based anion acceptor (AA) strategy that relies on intensive Lewis acid-base interactions, facilitates faster (de)fluorination kinetics at the electrode. The proposed room temperature fluoride ion batteries sustain improved electrochemical performance by pairing with the Pb-PbF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode and BiF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Ag cathode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Direct Chemical Repair of Etheno&#8208;Type RNA Damages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study identifies PS9, a synthetic flavin derivative, as the first chemical repair agent for etheno&#8208;type RNA damages. PS9 effectively removes &#1013;A and &#1013;C modifications in RNA via cycloaddition with singlet oxygen under blue light, presenting a novel approach distinct from traditional protein&#8208;mediated repair. This discovery highlights potential applications in understanding RNA damage repair and its implications for RNA biology and therapeutic development.







Abstract
Etheno damages in RNA represent a unique class of structural alterations that arise from exposure to various environmental stressors or endogenous processes. They significantly distort the RNA structure and affect crucial biological functions, including RNA&#8208;protein interactions, ribosome function, and translation fidelity. However, repair mechanisms for those etheno damages in RNA are still being elucidated. Here, a synthetic flavin derivative PS9 has been identified as the first example of chemical repair approach for this type of RNA damages. It efficiently managed the removal of etheno&#8208;type &#1013;A and &#1013;C damages in nucleosides, oligonucleotides in vitro, and in E. coli RNA in vivo under blue light irradiation. The capacity of the chemical approach relies on a unique cycloaddition activation of the etheno&#8208;bridge with singlet oxygen, which is distinct from traditional epoxidation of the C=C double bonds by proteins from the AlkB family. The understanding and effective manipulation of etheno damages in RNA with chemical tools hold implications for deciphering their role in mutagenesis and RNA biology, potentially opening avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions and biomarker development.

         <dc:description>
The Nobel Prize for Chemistry 2024 was jointly awarded to David Baker for computational protein design and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for protein structure prediction. This highlight showcases the impact of the Nobel prize laureates&#8217; contributions and summarizes the history, state of the art, applications and future directions of these methods.







Abstract
The ability to predict and design protein structures has led to numerous applications in medicine, diagnostics and sustainable chemical manufacture. In addition, the wealth of predicted protein structures has advanced our understanding of how life's molecules function and interact. Honouring the work that has fundamentally changed the way scientists research and engineer proteins, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024 was awarded to David Baker for computational protein design and jointly to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, who developed AlphaFold for machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based protein structure prediction. Here, we highlight notable contributions to the development of these computational tools and their importance for the design of functional proteins that are applied in organic synthesis. Notably, both technologies have the potential to impact drug discovery as any therapeutic protein target can now be modelled, allowing the de novo design of peptide binders and the identification of small molecule ligands through in silico docking of large compound libraries. Looking ahead, we highlight future research directions in protein engineering, medicinal chemistry and material design that are enabled by this transformative shift in protein science.

         <title>Development and Applications of an Amide Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide/NCO linchpin: A linchpin reagent for the synthesis of amides is disclosed using rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination followed by Grignard addition. The sequence proceeds with high chemoselectivity and provides secondary and tertiary amides through atypical bond construction. The formation of lactams and unsymmetrical ureas demonstrates extension to other NCO systems.







Abstract
Linchpin reagents are building blocks that can be chemoselectively functionalized to afford products with a common, useful functional group. In this work, we describe the development and validation of the first amide linchpin reagent and demonstrate its use as a doubly electrophilic building block for the synthesis of a variety of amides, including challenging classes. The linchpin reagent was first functionalized via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination. Selected masked C&#8208;isocyanate products were then further derivatized with Grignard reagents to produce secondary amides, or tertiary amides if an alkylating agent was added subsequently. The success of this sequence relies on fully controlled reactivity at each electrophilic site, first exploiting the weak N&#8722;O bond and then, the ability to form the free isocyanate intermediate in situ. The overall transformation proceeds with high chemoselectivity, demonstrating the ability of this new linchpin reagent to form amides through atypical bond construction. Finally, the potential of this reagent as a more broadly applicable NCO linchpin is demonstrated by the formation of lactams and unsymmetrical ureas.

         <title>Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols in water&#8212;a &#8242;Holy Grail of DKR&#8242;&#8212;was accomplished using an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) for racemization through a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing sequence and variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) for enantioselective acylation.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is a key method used to prepare optically pure compounds in 100&#8201;% theoretical yield starting from racemic substrates by combining the interconversion of substrate enantiomers with an enantioselective transformation. Various chemoenzymatic DKR approaches have been developed to deracemize secondary alcohols, typically requiring an organic solvent to facilitate enantioselective acylation, primarily catalyzed by lipases, alongside racemization mediated by an achiral, non&#8208;enzymatic catalyst. Achieving both steps in an aqueous solution remained elusive. Herein, we report a DKR of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous solution requiring only two biocatalysts. The first key to success was to achieve fast racemization in a buffer employing a non&#8208;stereoselective variant of an alcohol dehydrogenase (Lk&#8208;ADH&#8208;Prince) via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence. Engineered variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) enabled enantioselective acyl transfer in water. Besides the appropriate choice of the enzymes, identifying a suitable acyl donor was a second key to the success. The DKR was successfully demonstrated using (R)&#8208;selective MsAcT variants for a broad range of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols with 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl acetate as the acyl donor, yielding (R)&#8208;acetates with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conv. and high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent optical purity (83&#8211;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The (S)&#8208;acetates were accessible using a stereocomplementary (S)&#8208;selective MsAcT variant. Notably, substrate concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mM were tolerated in selected cases.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;level Modulation of N, S&#8208;Co&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres for Selective Aqueous Catalytic Oxidation of Ethylbenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly method is observed to synthesize nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active heteroatom species at molecular level. It is proposed that the doping of pyridinic&#8208;N and thiophene&#8208;S can notably change the charge and spin densities, promoting the chemical reactivity of adjacent carbon atoms and reducing the reaction energy barrier effectively.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of aromatic alkanes into high value&#8208;added products through benzylic C&#8722;H bond activation is one of the main reactions in chemical industry. On account of the constantly increasing demand for mass production, efficient, eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable catalysts are urgently needed. Herein, we describe a facile and versatile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly strategy towards molecular&#8208;level fabrication of co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active N and S species. The method enables a high degree of control over nanoparticle sizes, mesoporous nanostructures, contents of heteroatoms and the chemical composition.

     alt="Molecular-level Modulation of N, S-Co-Doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres for Selective Aqueous Catalytic Oxidation of Ethylbenzene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile emulsion-assisted interface self-assembly method is observed to synthesize nitrogen and sulfur co-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active heteroatom species at molecular level. It is proposed that the doping of pyridinic-N and thiophene-S can notably change the charge and spin densities, promoting the chemical reactivity of adjacent carbon atoms and reducing the reaction energy barrier effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective oxidation of aromatic alkanes into high value-added products through benzylic C&#8722;H bond activation is one of the main reactions in chemical industry. On account of the constantly increasing demand for mass production, efficient, eco-friendly and sustainable catalysts are urgently needed. Herein, we describe a facile and versatile emulsion-assisted interface self-assembly strategy towards molecular-level fabrication of co-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active N and S species. The method enables a high degree of control over nanoparticle sizes, mesoporous nanostructures, contents of heteroatoms and the chemical composition. The optimized catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance of 97&#8201;% ethylbenzene conversion and 98&#8201;% selectivity to acetophenone. Density functional theory simulations reveal that N, S-co-doping leads to the redistribution of charge and spin densities, introducing more active carbon atoms and realizing aerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene efficiently. This work presents a general strategy for molecular-level design of carbon-based catalysts, and also provides new insight into the influence of heteroatom-doping on catalytic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via Intramolecular Formal (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an approach to functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) through the formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of allylated cyclopropanes. Cyclopropane activation is achieved through direct photoexcitation of an appended imine. Activated and unactivated alkenes are tolerated in the reaction.







Abstract
We report a synthesis of bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via an intramolecular formal (3+2) cycloaddition of allylated cyclopropanes bearing a 4&#8208;nitrobenzimine substituent. Both activated and unactivated alkenes are tolerated in the transformation. The bicyclic imine products are prone to photo&#8208;induced ring opening, allowing for the epimerization of C5&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Screened d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Turing Structure of Confined Nickel for Sulfion Oxidation Accelerated Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constructed Turing structure, composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets, screens the direct d&#8208;p orbit coupling between TM and S2&#8722; and activates optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8722;, enabling exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production.







Abstract
The sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) could offer an energy&#8208;efficient and tech&#8208;economically favorable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for H2 production. Transition metal (TM) based catalysts have been considered promising candidates for SOR but suffer from limited activity due to the excessive bond strength from TM&#8208;S2&#8722; d&#8208;p orbit coupling. Herein, we propose a feasible strategy of screening direct d&#8208;p orbit hybridization between TM and S2&#8722; by constructing the Turing structure composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets. The optimized p&#8208;p orbit coupling between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8722; enables exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production. Specifically, it achieves a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow potential of 0.67&#8197;V vs. RHE for alkaline SOR. Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron transfer from Ni imparts metallicity and a higher p&#8208;band center to carbon shells, thereby contributing to optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization and a thermodynamically favorable stepwise sulfion degradation. Practically, a two&#8208;electrode flow cell achieves an industrial current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an unprecedented low voltage of 0.91&#8197;V while maintaining stability for over 300&#8197;hours, and exhibits high productivities of 3.83 and 0.32&#8197;kg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 for sulfur and H2, respectively.

         <dc:description>
Cordycicadins A&#8722;D are C20 polyketides, all containing a &#947;&#8208;lactone fused to a 10&#8208;membered lactone. The proposed biosynthesis for the cordycicadins anticipates the formation of two more natural products which are unisolated. We report the total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the two anticipated natural products.







Abstract
Cordycicadins A&#8722;D are four C20 polyketides, all containing a &#947;&#8208;lactone fused to a 10&#8208;membered lactone. The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the cordycicadins anticipates the formation of two more natural products which are unknown. We report the total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the two anticipated natural products 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B. The targets were convergently assembled, in a biomimetic fashion, via an efficient ketene trapping&#8208;intramolecular Michael addition sequence that delivered the requisite 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;fused framework with high diastereoselectivity, enabled by the synthesis of complex dioxenones that serve as in situ ketene precursors. Recognition of the embedded polyketide symmetry enabled the use of a divergent&#8208;convergent synthetic strategy, based on the use of two products from an early&#8208;stage enzymatic resolution. The synthetic routes afforded (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D in 14 steps and 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B in 13 steps (longest linear sequence). This work confirms the structure of (&#8722;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the observed instability of the anticipated natural product 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadin B during purification may explain why it is yet to be isolated.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Tuning Metallic Sites in Molecular Complexes for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenized molecular complexes were designed via coordinating Fe&#8722;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands for electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis verify that the ligands&#8208;tuning strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between molecular complexes and carbon support renders the charge accumulation on Fe&#8722;Ni sites through fast electron transfer, following by the reconstruction of active Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni centers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic hybrid catalysts with highly tunable single&#8208;sites are promising for oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER), but molecular&#8208;scale understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms still remain elusive on these bulk materials. Herein, we report a direct construction of heterogenized molecular complexes stabilized on carbon substrates via coordinating Fe&#8722;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands (FeNi&#8208;Lx). The ligands&#8208;tuning &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between aromatic carboxylate ligands and carbon supports promote the oxidative charge accumulation on Fe&#8722;Ni sites via fast electron transferring, thus the optimized FeNi&#8208;Lx rendering a mass activity of 6680&#8197;A&#8201;gFe/Ni&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;V overpotential. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the OH&#8722; nucleophilic attack on hypervalent iron sites induce the reconstruction of active Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni species, accompanying with fast valence increasing. Whereas, during OER, the unexpected valence reduction of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni sites would be attributed to the oxygen&#8208;generating from OOH* intermediates. These findings would establish an essential understanding of the origin of active centers in molecular complexes catalysts for oxygen&#8208;evolution.

         <title>Combining Simple Deformations to Elicit Complex Motions and Directed Swimming of Smart Organic Crystals with Controllable Thickness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. The resulting crystal&#8208;based robots exhibit motions reminiscent of sailing and humanoid movements.







Abstract
The lack of control over the crystal growth in a systematic way currently stands as an unsurmountable impediment to the preparation of dynamic crystals as soft robots; in effect, the mechanical effects of molecular crystals have become a subject of scattered reports that pertain only to specific crystal sizes and actuation conditions, often without the ability to establish or confirm systematic trends. One of the factors that prevents the verification of such performance is the unavailability of strategies for effectively controlling crystal size and aspect ratio, where crystals of serendipitous size are harvested from crystallization solution. Here we devised a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals of chemical variants of 9&#8208;anthracene derivatives with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. By capitalizing on the robust mechanical flexibility and deformability of crystals, we demonstrate systematic variations in crystal deformation that are further elevated in complexity to construct crystal&#8208;based robots capable of controllable motions reminiscent of sailing and humanoid movements. The results illustrate an approach to eliminate one of the critical obstacles towards complete control over the motility of dynamic molecular crystals as microrobots in non&#8208;aerial environments.

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy towards Michael Addition Reactions of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical strategy for organic&#8208;base&#8208;catalyzed Michael addition to cyclopropenes generated in situ is disclosed. In this metal&#8208;free approach, a diverse range of nitrogen nucleophiles, including drugs and bioactive molecules, are well tolerated to provide the triple substituted cyclopropanes, which have been used to access cyclopropane carboxylic acids&#8212;a new class of promising FABP&#8208;4 inhibitors.







Abstract
The development of Michael addition reactions to conjugated cyclopropenes is a challenge in organic synthesis due to the fleeting and reactive nature of such strained Michael acceptor systems. Herein, the development of a photochemical approach towards such conjugated cyclopropenes is reported that serves as a strategic entry point to densely functionalized cyclopropanes in a diastereoselective fashion. The process involves the light&#8208;mediated generation of transient cyclopropenyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters from vinyl diazo esters, followed by an organic base catalyzed nucleophilic addition of N&#8208;heterocycles to directly access &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic cyclopropanoic esters. With this synergistic approach, various trisubstituted cyclopropanes bearing N&#8208;heteroaryl and N&#8208;heterocyclic rings such as indole, pyrrole, benzimidazole, isatin, pyridinone, and quinolinone were accessed efficiently in good yield and decent to good diastereoselectivities. Further, &#946;&#8208;indolyl cyclopropanoic acids have been synthesized and were successfully evaluated as FABP&#8208;4 inhibitors. Theoretical calculations have been performed to elucidate the mechanism, which was further supported by experimental findings.

         <title>A Scenario for a Carbon&#8208;Neutral Ammonia&#8208;Fueled Engine Mediated by Catalytic NH3 Cracking and CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct use of ammonia as engine fuel faces challenges like low flame velocity and high NOx emissions. We propose a novel scenario for converting a conventional &#8220;CH4&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 is used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust which then reacts with NH3 to generate N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle.







Abstract
Utilizing near zero&#8208;carbon NH3 as fuel in engines is promising for carbon&#8208;neutrality. However, the application of NH3 into the engine suffers from the intrinsic poor combustion characteristics of NH3 and the emission of harmful NOx exhausts. Herein, we proposed and successfully confirmed a novel scenario for converting a conventional &#8220;CH4&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 was used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust. Afterwards, we put forward two routes to convert the exhaust and NH3 into N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle. The first &#8220;spatially decoupled&#8221; route splits the exhaust treatment into NH3 cracking over Ru clusters on the calcined Mg&#8722;Al hydrotalcite (Ru/MAO) and CO2 methanation over a commercial Ni/Al2O3. Both NH3 and CO2 were almost completely converted into the target products under their respective optimal conditions. The second &#8220;spatially coupled&#8221; route refers to an one&#8208;pot reaction of NH3 and CO2 into N2, CH4, and H2O. Due to the mismatch of reaction conditions and the competitive adsorption of reactants, the conversions of NH3 and CO2 were lowered to 80.1&#8201;% and 49.3&#8201;%, respectively, over Ru/MAO under 1&#8197;bar (CO2:NH3=3&#8201;:&#8201;8) at 550&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks by Implanting Cu Sites with Perfluorooctane to Accelerate CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously. Yet, it remains an ongoing challenge due to the competition with thermodynamically more preferred ethylene production. Herein, we presented a CO2 reduction predilection switch from ethylene to ethanol (ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4) by inherently implanting Cu sites with perfluorooctane to create interfacial non&#8208;covalent interactions. The 1.83%F&#8208;Cu2O organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids (OIHs) exhibited an extraordinary ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) of &#8764;55.2%, with an impressive ethanol partial current density of 166 mA cm&#8208;2 and excellent robustness over 60 hours of continuous operation. This exceptional performance ranks our 1.83%F&#8208;Cu2O OIHs among the best&#8208;performing ethanol&#8208;oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our findings identified that C8F18 could strengthen the interfacial hydrogen bonding connectivity, which consequently promotes the generation of active hydrogen species and preferentially favors the hydrogenation of *CHCOH to *CHCHOH, thus switching the reaction from ethylene&#8208;preferred to ethanol&#8208;oriented. The presented investigations highlight opportunities for using noncovalent interactions to tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, bringing it closer to practical implementation requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Halide Cathode Materials Based on Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Reaction Towards All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with non&#8208;flammable solid&#8208;state electrolytes offer high energy density and enhanced safety. However, their energy densities are greatly limited by low&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity oxide cathode materials, typically relying on the intercalation&#8208;deintercalation mechanism with a catholyte content of 15~30 wt.%. Here we introduce the LixFeXx+2 (X=Cl, Br) families as high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity alternatives, operating via a 3 mol e&#8208; transfer intercalation&#8208;conversion coupling reaction. Notably, the catholyte&#8208;free ASSLBs using 95 wt.% LiFeCl3 active material delivers a remarkable capacity of 446 mAh g&#8208;1 and a high energy density of 912 Wh kg&#8208;1, which surpasses most oxide cathode materials. Of particular interest is the formation of amorphous Fe during the conversion process. The amorphous Fe exhibits high activity, catalyzing the conversion of LiX back to LixFeXx+2, which proves instrumental in realizing reversible intercalation&#8208;conversion reactions. These halide cathode materials represent a significant advancement towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Alloying Strategy Regulating Size and Electronic Structure of Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to Achieve High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of catalysts in lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries has proven to be an efficacious avenue for enhancing the kinetics of polysulfide conversion. Specially, the size and electronic structure of catalysts play a pivotal role in harnessing the active sites and intrinsic catalysis activity. Outstanding MoSe2 and NbSe2 are selected from 16 universal transition metal selenides based on the proposed binary descriptor. Then, an alloying strategy is devised to prepare Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 flakelets for further improvement of the intrinsic catalysis. The integration of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis demonstrates that alloying Mo with Nb can regulate the surface energy and indexes of band match and lattice mismatch, thereby enabling Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to possess a small size, suitable adsorption energy and low reaction energy barrier. This optimization enhances the catalysis of sulfur reduction/evolution reaction and the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium. Consequently, an assembled Ah&#8208;level pouch cell is realized with dramatic cycle stability. With the electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2.36 &#956;L mg S&#8211;1, the cell can deliver a high energy density of up to 505.4&#8201;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1. This work pioneers a universal strategy for sculpting the geometric configurations and electronic structures of catalysts, to achieve enhanced catalytic activity and precise interpretation of structure&#8722;activity relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Rotor Assembly for the Design of a Hybrid Ferroelectric&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Multiferroic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric (FE)&#8208;antiferromagnetic (AFM) multiferroic materials have sparked growing interest due to their huge possibilities in energy&#8208;saving, photoelectric devices, nonvolatile storage, and switches. However, realizing FE&#8208;AFM properties in a hybrid molecular material is difficult because ferroelectric and magnetic orders are commonly mutually exclusive. Here, we report an FE&#8208;AFM multiferroic semiconductor [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[Mn(SCN)4] (NCMS) by supramolecular assembly approach via molecular rotor synthon [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] and inorganic magnetic module [Mn(SCN)4]. Interestingly, NCMS shows good ferroelectricity with a spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 5.94 &#956;C cm&#8722;2 higher than most crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Especially, the realization of antiferromagnetism is for the first time in the crown ether hybrid perovskite ferroic systems. Additionally, semiconductor NCMS displays an X&#8208;ray radiation detection response with a large photo/dark current on&#8208;off ratio (197). Our study not only gives a deep insight into understanding multiferroic properties but also provides a novel and efficient approach to realizing high&#8208;performance hybrid multiferroic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Spin&#8208;Selective Channels in Fully&#8208;Exposed PtFe Clusters Enable   Fast Cathodic Kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 Batter y</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs), the electron transfer between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 possesses a spin&#8208;dependent character but is still neglected, while the spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer without losing phase information should guarantee fast kinetics and reduced energy barriers. Here, we provide a paradigm of spin&#8208;selective catalysis for LOB that the ferromagnetic quantum spin exchange interactions between Pt and Fe atoms in fully&#8208;exposed PtFe clusters filter directional e&#8208;spins for spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer at Fe&#8208;Fe sites. The kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction is markedly accelerated as predicted by theoretical calculations, showing dramatically decreased relaxation time of the rate determining step for more than one order of magnitude, compared with the Fe clusters without spin&#8208;selective behavior. In consequence, the assembled LOB provides ultrahigh energy conversion efficiency of 89.6% at 100 mA g&#8208;1 under a discharge&#8208;charge overpotential of only 0.32 V. This work provides new insights into the spin&#8208;dependent mechanisms of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction, and the strategy of constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on a Narrowband Near&#8208;Ultraviolet and a Hot Exciton&#160;Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high efficiency narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet (NUV) emitters in organic light emitting diode (OLED) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) molecule, named ICz&#8208;BO, is prepared and characterized, in which both multiresonant (MR) skeletons are integrated via conjugation connection. A slightly distorted structure and weak intramolecular charge transfer (CT) interaction between two MR subunits lead to a high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (h&#8208;RISC) channel of T6&#8594;S1, also evidenced by both experimental and calculated results. Impressively, the ICz&#8208;BO emitter exhibits outstanding narrowband NUV emission at 404 nm with a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 28 nm in toluene solution. The solution processable OLED shows an excellent device performance with the recorded maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.01%, concomitant with an extremely low y&#8208;axis Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIEy) value of 0.031. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported for the HLCT&#8208;based NUV&#8208;OLEDs to date. This research proves that the MR skeleton plays a positive effect on the narrowband hot exciton emitter, which provides an alternative paradigm for developing high&#8208;efficiency NUV emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Aliphatic Amines Unlocked for Selective Transformations through Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While aromatic diazonium salts are important reagents in organic synthesis, &#8216;Diazonium ions generated from ordinary aliphatic primary amines are usually useless for preparative purposes, since they lead to a mixture of products giving not only substitution by any nucleophile present, but also elimination and rearrangements if the substrate permits.&#8217;[1] In this work, we report that the statement is no longer valid, and it is now possible to control diazotization of aliphatic amines by utilizing isopentyl nitrite in HFIP. This transformation enabled electrophilic aromatic substitution with these highly abundant and commercially available alkyl reagents, as well as transforming them into building blocks typically employed in organic synthesis. The methodology opens an avenue for reactions involving aliphatic amines, even such demanding substrates as amino acids, as a source of carbocations thus expanding the degree of chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Interaction Dynamics of an Enantioselective Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Acylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods like carbon relaxation dispersion in the rotating frame (13C&#8208;R1&#961;) and proton chemical exchange saturation transfer (1H&#8208;CEST) are key methods to investigate molecular recognition in biomacromolecules and to detect molecular motions on the &#181;s to s timescale, revealing transient conformational states. Changes in kinetics can be linked to binding, folding, or catalytic events. Here, we investigated whether these methods allow detection of changes in the dynamics of a small, highly selective peptide catalyst during recognition of its enantiomeric substrates. The flexible tetrapeptide Boc&#8208;l&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;Me)&#8208;His&#8208;AGly&#8208;l&#8208;Cha&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe, used for the monoacetylation of cycloalkane&#8208;diols, is probed at natural abundance using 13C&#8208;R1&#961; and 1H&#8208;CEST. Indeed, we detected differences in dynamics of the peptide upon interaction with the diol. Importantly, these differ depending on the enantiomer of the substrate used. These enantiospecific influences of the substrates on the dynamics of the peptide are rationalized using computational techniques. We find that even though one enantiomer reacts faster, as confirmed by reaction monitoring, the other is more tightly bound in DCM (as confirmed by 1H&#8208;saturation transfer difference (STD) measurements). These findings provide insights into the recognition of the substrates and explain the selectivity differences observed between the solvents toluene and DCM.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adjuvanting Large Pore 2D Covalent Organic Framework as a Vaccine Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine&#8208;associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half&#8208;life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell&#8208;mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen&#8208;presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>A Supramolecular Approach to Engineering Living Cells with Enzymes for Adaptive and Recyclable Cascade Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic transformation in nature is inherently dynamic, spontaneous, and adaptive, enabling complex chemical synthesis and metabolism. These processes often&#160;involve supramolecular recognition among cells, enzymes, and biomacromolecules, far&#160;surpassing the capabilities of isolated cells and enzymes used in industrial synthesis. Inspired by nature, here we design a supramolecular approach to equip living cells with these capacities, enabling recyclable, efficient cascade reactions. Our two&#8208;step&#160;"plug&#8208;and&#8208;play" methodology&#160;begins by coating&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;cells with guest&#8208;containing polymers&#160;(SupraBAC) via&#160;supramolecular charge interactions, followed by the introduction of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized host enzymes through host&#8208;guest chemistry, creating a robust cell&#8208;enzyme complex. This supramolecular coating not only protects cells from various stresses, such as UV radiation, heat, and organic solvents, but also facilitates the overexpression of intracellular enzymes and the attachment of extracellular enzymes within and on SupraBAC. This combination results in efficient multienzyme cascade synthesis, enabling two&#8208; and three&#8208;step reactions in one pot. Importantly, the multienzyme system can be recycled up to five times without significant loss of activity. Our findings introduce a versatile, adaptive supramolecular coating for whole&#8208;cell catalysts, offering a sustainable and efficient solution for complex synthesis in both chemistry and industrial biotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks Based on Linear and Trigonal Linkers for High&#8208;Performance H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks based on low&#8208;connectivity linear and trigonal linkers were constructed by the steric hindrance. The efficiency of the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide was markedly enhanced by regulating of the skeleton from two&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional configuration.







Abstract
The design of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) using linear and trigonal linkers remains challenging due to the difficulty in achieving a specific non&#8208;planar spatial arrangement with low&#8208;connectivity building units. Here, we report the novel 3D COFs with linear and trigonal linkers, termed TMB&#8208;COFs, exhibiting srs topology. The steric hindrance provides an additional force to alter the torsion angles of peripheral triangular units, guiding the linear unit to connect with the trigonal unit into 3D srs frameworks, rather than the more commonly observed two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hcb structures. Furthermore, we comprehensively examined the hydrogen peroxide photocatalytic production capacity of the TMB&#8208;COFs in comparison with analogous 2D COFs. The experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate a significant enhancement in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production efficacy through framework regulation. This work emphasizes the steric configuration using low connectivity building units, offering a fresh perspective on the design and application of 3D COFs.

         <title>Enabling controllable time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence in carbonized polymer dots based on chromophore excited triplet energy level modulation by ionic bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials are highly attractive for realizing multitiered dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. It&#8217;s extremely challenging to modulate puzzle of multiple luminescence species and understand the intrinsic mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and synthesize&#8208;friendly strategy to develop a high contrast TDPC carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with adjustable lifetime and quantum yields. The ionic bonding is introduced in self&#8208;protected CPDs to effectively tune the excited triplet energy level of chromophores, and promote the stable existence of L&#8208;aspartic (AA) with green phosphorescence at 545 nm, and alkali metal aspartates (AA&#8208;M) with red phosphorescence at 665 nm. The precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE) effect. And, the efficient radiative energy transfer could be proven as an intrinsic mechanism for better understanding the TDPC materials. These results further expand on the fundamental principle to design high&#8208;quality TDPC materials with more flexible regulation for luminescence properties, providing a major step forward in broadening the scope of smart phosphorescence applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalysis of Molecular&#8208;Like Au8M(PPh3)8n+ Clusters Cultivated in Mesoporous SBA&#8208;15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a dream of researchers to be able to tailor the catalytic performances by adjusting heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level. Atomically precise metal clusters provide us with the possibility to achieve this challenge. Here, we design a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy coupled with TiOx coating to prepare the heterogeneous catalysts denoted as TiOx/Au8M@SBA via cultivating atomically precise Au8M(PPh3)8n+ (M = Pd, Pt or Au; n = 2 for Pd/Pt and 3 for Au) clusters in mesoporous molecular sieve. The catalysts are made up of the three functional units, which include Au8M(PPh3)8n+ clusters that can act as the active sites, the pore environment of the SBA&#8208;15 that can announce a catalysis show for the clusters with precise number of atoms maintained during the chemical reactions, and the TiOx coating that can further inhibit the migration of the clusters under reaction conditions. The selective hydrogenation of acetylene performed in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor taken, for example, we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis. This work sheds light on the fundamental insight into catalysis origin of heterogeneous catalysts and achieves a distinguished level of detail for cluster catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;small Metallic Nickel Nanoparticles on Dealuminated Zeolite for Active and Durable Catalytic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Each step in the catalyst synthesis process plays an important role in tuning the catalyst structures. For zeolite&#8208;supported nickel catalysts, we found the conventional calcination&#8208;reduction method typically leads to the formation of large nickel particles, but a pre&#8208;aging in hydrogen or nitrogen at a low temperature prior to final reduction can result in ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles in a metallic state. This pre&#8208;aging treatment facilitates the interaction between Ni2+ cations and silanol nests on zeolite before the decomposition of the metal salt, leading to the formation of nanoparticles with an average diameter of ~1.2 nm. In contrast, the pre&#8208;calcination in oxygen caused the Ni2+ aggregation before the decomposition of the metal salt precursor, yielding nickel nanoparticles larger than 5 nm. Given the structure sensitivity of nickel in cyclohexane dehydrogenation for hydrogen production, the ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles exhibited significantly enhanced activity and durability compared to previous nickel catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Responsive Artificial H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels for Targeted Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ion channels regulate the ion flow across the membranes in response to alterations in the cellular redox state, playing a crucial role in cellular adaptation to oxidative stress. Despite their significance, replicating ROS&#8208;responsive functionality in artificial ion channels remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel class of artificial H+/Cl&#8208; ion channels activatable by elevated ROS levels in cancer cells. ROS&#8208;induced decaging of the phenylboronate group triggers the rapid release of the channel&#8208;forming units, leading to self&#8208;assembly of the H&#8208;bonded cascades facilitating the synergistic transport of H+ and Cl&#8208; ions, with H+/Cl&#8208; ion transport selectivity of 7.7. Upon activation, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant apoptotic activity against human breast cancer cells, achieving an IC50 of 2.8 &#956;M, comparable to that of paclitaxel. Exploiting the intrinsic oxidative microenvironment of cancer cells, along with the enhanced oxidative stress arising from H+/Cl&#8208; co&#8208;transport, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl demonstrates exceptional selectivity in targeting cancer cells with a selectivity index of 10.2 over normal breast cells, outperforming that of paclitaxel by 19.4 folds.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangement of Azo Compounds Enables Low&#8208;Potential, High&#8208;capacity Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread adoption of rechargeable alkaline batteries is plagued by the performance&#8208;limiting metal anodes, which are prone to (electro)chemical corrosion and raise environmental or economic concerns. Organic redox&#8208;active materials offer a potential solution, but they typically struggle with dissolution&#8208;induced degradation and insufficiently negative reduction potentials. Herein, we introduce benzo[c]cinnoline and its derivatives (collectively referred to as BCCs), a class of aromatic azo compounds with fused&#8208;ring structure, as promising organic anode materials. BCCs exhibit pronounced aromaticity and Br&#248;nsted basicity, conferring low reduction potentials and intrinsic insolubility in alkaline solutions. Paired with the industrially established nickel hydroxide cathode, these batteries deliver high capacity (297 mAh g&#8722;1anode), output voltage of 1.3 V, and extended cycle life (&#8776; 16000 cycles). Notably, they also operate efficiently at extremely low temperatures down to &#8722;85 &#176;C with an 8 M KOH electrolyte. We further explore the feasibility for all&#8208;organic alkaline batteries by paring BCCs with the dihydro form of 4,4'&#8208;azopyridine, utilizing azo compounds for both anode and cathodes. This chemistry leverages the unique properties of small organic molecules to achieve batteries with high capacity (236 mAh g&#8211;1), fast charging (1200 C), and easy recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Synthesized ~1 nm Multilevel Capacitor&#8208;like Particle with Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Can the chemically synthesized nanoparticles act as nanodevices or nanomachines? Herein, we demonstrated its feasibility. A novel nanocluster (ultrasmall nanoparticles) [Au44Cd20(m&#8208;MBT)40][N(C8H17)4]2 (Au44Cd20 in short, m&#8208;MBTH: m&#8208;methylbenzenethiol) obtained via developing a synthesis method have a cannula&#8208;like structure of the outer shell and an internal sleeve, revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Natural population analysis (NPA) charge calculations, charge carrier transport of Au44Cd20 (during which an intra&#8208;nanocluster anti&#8208;galvanic reaction was observed) after unneutral charging using NaBH4 and voltammetry proved the capacitor&#8208;like character of Au44Cd20. The subsidiary capacitor&#8208;like character of the outer shell of Au44Cd20 was further probed via NPA charge calculations and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Thus, this study predicts a new era of engineering metal nanoparticles for realizing atomically precise ultrasmall nanodevices and nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to C2'&#8208;Aryl/Alkenyl Nucleosides with Electrochemical Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically modified oligonucleotides have garnered significant attention in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology due to their enhanced stability in vivo compared to naturally occurring oligonucleotides. However, current methods for synthesizing modified nucleosides, particularly at the C2&#8242;&#8208;position, are limited in terms of efficiency, modularity, and selectivity. Herein, we report a new approach for the synthesis of highly functionalized C2&#8242;&#8208;a&#8208;aryl/alkenyl nucleosides via an electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of 2'&#8208;bromo nucleosides with a variety of (hetero)aryl and alkenyl iodides. This method affords a diverse array of C2&#8242;&#8208; a&#8208;aryl/ alkenyl nucleosides with excellent stereoselectivities, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. We further synthesized oligonucleotides incorporating C2&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;modified thymidine moieties and demonstrated that their annealed double&#8208;stranded DNAs exhibit decreased melting temperatures (Tm). Additionally, oligonucleotides with C2&#8242;&#8208;aryl modifications at the 3&#8242; end showed enhanced resistance to 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease degradation and C2&#8242;&#8208;aryl modifications did not impede the cellular uptake process, highlighting the potential of these modified oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Radical Polymerization of &#945;&#8208;Olefins via Remote Hydrogen Atom or Group Transfer for Enhanced Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing polar groups into non&#8208;polar polyolefins can significantly enhance the important properties of materials. However, producing polyolefin backbones consisting of polar blocks remains elusive, due to the substantial difference of reactivity ratios between polar and non&#8208;polar olefin monomers in radical polymerization or the poisoning of transition&#8208;metal catalysts by polar groups in coordination polymerization. Herein we present a practical way for the preparation of polyethylene&#8208;based polymers with distinct polar groups by radical polymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefins. A strategy of switchable remote hydrogen atom or group transfer is devised, leading to a diverse range of AAB or ABC sequence&#8208;defined carbon&#8208;chain polyolefins. The utility of these polymers is demonstrated by using poly(ethyl 2&#8208;cyanohept&#8208;6&#8208;enoate) (P2) as an interphase layer material in anode&#8208;free Li metal battery, which effectively improves the cycling stability of the battery and indicates its potential in energy storage applications.</dc:description>

Photogenerated carriers can be captured by phase transition induced defects (PTIDs) formed by hybrid&#8208;phase within the same MAPbI3 single crystal and then be &#8220;protected&#8221; form radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations. The mobility of PTID&#8208;dressed nonluminescent carriers is successfully promoted by about 14&#8208;fold to as high as 1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, comparing with band&#8208;edge free carriers at room temperature. What's more, facilitated by this highly diffusive nonluminescent carrier within, the MAPbI3 NWs&#8208;based photodetector's responsivity is promoted by about three times.







Abstract
Crystal structural rearrangements unavoidably introduce defects into materials, where even these small changes in local lattice structure could arouse a prominent impact on the overall nature of crystals. Contrary to the traditional notion that defects obstruct carrier transport, herein, we report a promoted transport mechanism of nonluminescent carriers in single&#8208;crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires (1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, about a 14&#8208;fold improvement), enabled by the phase transition induced defects (PTIDs). Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long&#8208;distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications. The findings provide broader insights into the carrier transport mechanism in perovskite semiconductors and have significant implications for their rational design for photoelectronic applications at varied operating temperatures.

         <title>Comprehensive Profiling of Roquin Binding Preferences for RNA Stem&#8208;Loops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

sRBNS (structured RNA Bind&#8208;n&#8208;Seq) allows precise mapping of RNA&#8208;protein interactions including RNA structures at nucleotide resolution. Using this new method, we dissected the RNA&#8208;binding preferences of Roquin proteins towards RNA stem&#8208;loops, identified new high&#8208;affinity motifs and expanded the mRNA target space in cells. Thus, sRBNS allows for the detailed investigation of complex binding events beyond single stranded RNA motifs.







Abstract
The cellular levels of mRNAs are controlled post&#8208;transcriptionally by cis&#8208;regulatory elements located in the 3&#8217;&#8208;untranslated region. These linear or structured elements are recognized by RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs) to modulate mRNA stability. The Roquin&#8208;1 and &#8722;2 proteins specifically recognize RNA stem&#8208;loop motifs, the trinucleotide loop&#8208;containing constitutive decay elements (CDEs) and the hexanucleotide loop&#8208;containing alternative decay elements (ADEs), with their unique ROQ domain to initiate mRNA degradation. However, the RNA&#8208;binding capacity of Roquin towards different classes of stem&#8208;loops has not been rigorously characterized, leaving its exact binding preferences unclear. Here, we map the RNA&#8208;binding preference of the ROQ domain at nucleotide resolution introducing sRBNS (structured RNA Bind&#8208;n&#8208;Seq), a customized RBNS workflow with pre&#8208;structured RNA libraries. We found a clear preference of Roquin towards specific loop sizes and extended the consensus motifs for CDEs and ADEs. The newly identified motifs are recognized with nanomolar affinity through the canonical RNA&#8208;ROQ interface. Using these new stem&#8208;loop variants as blueprints, we predicted novel Roquin target mRNAs and verified the expanded target space in&#8197;cells. The study demonstrates the power of high&#8208;throughput assays including RNA structure formation for the systematic investigation of (structural) RNA&#8208;binding preferences to comprehensively identify mRNA targets and elucidate the biological function of RBPs.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Enabled Process with Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustainable Plastic Waste Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a novel plasma&#8208;enabled strategy for rapidly decomposing various plastic wastes into high&#8208;value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. This innovative approach provides an attractive solution to the pressing issue of plastic waste accumulation, which poses significant environmental challenges and complicates waste management. Our method offers a cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and selective means of directly converting complex plastic wastes into valuable products, thereby supporting a circular plastic economy.







Abstract
The escalating issue of plastic waste generation has prompted the search for an effective solution to address these challenges. In this study, we present a novel plasma&#8208;enabled strategy for the rapid breakdown of various types of plastic wastes, including mixtures, into high&#8208;value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. The H2 yield and selectivity achieved through the implemented catalyst&#8208;free plasma&#8208;enabled strategy are 14.2 and 5.9&#8197;times higher, respectively, compared to those obtained with conventional thermal pyrolysis under similar conditions. It is noteworthy that this catalyst&#8208;free plasma alone approach yields a significantly higher energy yield of H2 (gH2/kWh) compared to other pyrolysis processes. By coupling plasma pyrolysis with thermal catalytic process, employing of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% M/CeO2 (M=Fe, Co, and Ni) atomically dispersed catalysts can further enhance hydrogen production. Specifically, the 1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Co/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance throughout the 10&#8197;cycles of plastic waste decomposition, achieving the highest H2 yield of 46.7&#8197;mmol/gplastic (equivalent to 64.4&#8201;% of theoretical H2 production) and nearly 100&#8201;% hydrogen atom recovery efficiency at the 7th cycle. Notably, the H2 yield achieved over the atomically dispersed Fe on CeO2 surface (1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Fe/CeO2) in the integrated plasma&#8208;thermal catalytic process is comparable to that obtained with Fe particles on CeO2 surface (10&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Fe/CeO2). This outcome, demonstrated with single&#8208;atom catalysts, offers a promising avenue for cost&#8208;effective and efficient chemical plastic recycling. Through a combination of experimental and computational efforts, we have provided an in&#8208;depth understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of the investigated single atom catalysts in the developed plasma&#8208;enabled process. This innovative and straightforward approach provides a promising and expedient strategy for continuously converting diverse plastic waste streams, including mixed and contaminated sources, into high&#8208;value products conducive to a circular plastic economy.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation of Indoles with N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclopropanation of indoles has been developed using trifluoromethyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. The reaction enables rapid construction of diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused indolines bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocenter in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, even for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex biologically relevant substrates.







Abstract
Herein we report a general rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intermolecular dearomative cyclopropanation of indoles using trifluoromethyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. The reaction enables the rapid construction of diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused indolines bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocenter with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). This mild method exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerating various functional groups, and can even be utilized for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex bioactive molecules. DFT calculations suggest that the formation of a key zwitterionic intermediate is responsible for the chiral induction. Overall, this approach opens up new possibilities for asymmetric cyclopropanation of challenging aromatic heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with various nucleophiles driven by visible light has been developed. This metal&#8208;free method is selective and produces diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. Additionally, it allows for full 13C isotopic incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with different nucleophiles to generate valuable carbonyl derivatives under visible light irradiation. This method is mild, robust, highly selective, and proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions to prepare a range of structurally diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. In addition, we highlight the application of this activation strategy for 13C isotopic incorporation. We propose that the reaction proceeds by a photoinduced reduction to afford carbon&#8208;centered radicals from alkyl halides, which undergo subsequent single electron&#8208;oxidation to form a carbocationic intermediate. Carbon monoxide is trapped by the carbocation to generate an acylium cation, which can be attacked by a series of nucleophiles to give a range of carbonyl products.

         <title>Selective Covalent Inhibiting JNK3 by Small Molecules for Parkinson's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

We discovered JC16I, the first JNK3&#8208;selective covalent inhibitor, which could target conserved cysteine in JNK family. JC16I potently and selectively inhibits and labels JNK3 in living cells and cell lysates, and demonstrates neuroprotective effects in PD models without compromising safety.







Abstract
c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinases (JNKs) including JNK1/2/3 are key members of mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase family. Wherein JNK3 is specifically expressed in brain and emerges as therapeutic target, especially for neurodegenerative diseases. However, developing JNK3 selective inhibitors as chemical probes to investigate its therapeutic potential in diseases remains challenging. Here, we adopted the covalent strategy for identifying JNK3&#8208;selective covalent inhibitor JC16I, with high inhibitory activity against JNK3. Despite targeting a conserved cysteine in the vicinity of ATP pocket in JNK family, JC16I exerted a greater than 160&#8208;fold selectivity for JNK3 over JNK1/2. Importantly, even at low concentration, JC16I showed enhanced and long&#8208;lasting inhibition against cellular JNK3. In addition, its alkyne&#8208;containing probe JC&#8208;P1 could label JNK3 in SH&#8208;SY5Y cell lysate and living cells, with good proteome&#8208;wide selectivity. JC16I selectively suppressed the abnormal activation of JNK3 signaling and sufficiently exhibited neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's diseases (PD) models. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of developing isoform&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active JNK3 inhibitors by covalent drug design strategy targeting a conserved cysteine. This work not only provides a valuable chemical probe for JNK3&#8208;targeted investigations in vitro and in vivo but also opens new avenues for the treatment of PD.

         <title>Isomeric Dimer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells with over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomer dimer acceptors were designed and synthesized, D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced planarity, elevated LUMO energy, more ordered stacking, and desirable phase separation. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh achieved a higher efficiency of 19.05&#8201;% and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
The strategy of isomerization is known for its simple yet effective role in optimizing molecular configuration and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the impact of isomerization on the design of dimer acceptors has been rarely investigated, and the relationship between the chemical structure and optoelectronic property remains unclear. In this study, we designed and synthesized two dimer acceptor isomers named D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. Compared to D&#8208;TN, D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced backbone planarity, elevated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, and more ordered molecular stacking. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh achieved a PCE of 19.05&#8201;%, higher than that (PCE=18.42&#8201;%) of the device based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TN. Large&#8208;area PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh devices (1&#8197;cm2) yielded a PCE of 18.00&#8201;%. More importantly, the extrapolated T80 lifetime of the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;D&#8208;TPh device is over 2800&#8197;h with MPP tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. These results suggest that isomerization strategy is an effective way to optimize the molecular configuration of dimer acceptors for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.

         <title>Anion Chemistry towards On&#8208;Site Construction of Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Metallic Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of lacking effective SEI on Zn anode in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte, a cathodic route was developed to achieve a uniform OTf&#8722;&#8208;involved artificial SEI on Zn anode, which brings the merits of promoting interfacial kinetics, depressing side reactions, and prolonging ZMB lifespan.







Abstract
Reversibility of metallic Zn anode serves as the corner stone for the development of aqueous Zn metal battery, which motivates scrutinizing the electrolyte&#8208;Zn interface. As the representative organic zinc salt, zinc trifluorosulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) facilitates a broad class of aqueous electrolytes, however, the stability issue of Zn anode remains crucial. The great challenge lies in the lack of Zn anode protection by the pristinely formed surface structure in aqueous Zn(OTf)2 electrolytes. Accordingly, an electrochemical route was developed to grow a uniform zinc trifluorosulfonate hydroxide (ZTH) layer on Zn anode as an artificial SEI, via regulation on metal dissolution and strong coordination ability of zinc ions. Co&#8208;precipitation was proposed to be the formation mechanism for the artificial SEI, where the reduction stability of OTf&#8722; anion and the low&#8208;symmetry layer structure of ZTH was unmasked. This artificial SEI favors interfacial kinetics, depresses side reactions, and well maintains its integrity during cycling, leading to a prolonged lifespan of Zn stripping/plating with a high DOD of ~85&#8201;%, and an improved cycling stability of ~92&#8201;% retention rate for V2O5/Zn cell at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The unveiled role of anion on Zn anode drives the contemplation on the surface chemistry for the blooming aqueous rechargeable battery.

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifting B12&#8208;Dependent Photoreceptor Protein via Optical Coupling for Inducible Living Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;shifting of B12&#8208;dependent photoreceptor CarHC has been accomplished by labeling with the red light&#8208;capturing fluorophore Cy5, which further enables the assembly and disassembly of biomacromolecules or living cells in a B12 and red light&#8208;dependent manner. This optical coupling approach can potentially be expanded for spectral tuning of other optogenetic tools.







Abstract
Cobalamin (B12)&#8208;dependent photoreceptors are gaining traction in materials synthetic biology, especially for optically controlling cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell adhesion in living materials. However, these proteins are mostly responsive to green light, limiting their deep&#8208;tissue applications. Here, we present a general strategy for shifting photoresponse of B12&#8208;dependent photoreceptor CarHC from green to red/far&#8208;red light via optical coupling. Using thiol&#8208;maleimide click chemistry, we labeled cysteine&#8208;containing CarHC mutants with SulfoCyanine5 (Cy5), a red light&#8208;capturing fluorophore. The resulting photoreceptors not only retained the ability to tetramerize in the presence of adenosylcobalamin (AdoB12), but also gained sensitivity to red light; labeled tetramers disassembled on red light exposure. Using genetically encoded click chemistry, we assembled the red&#8208;shifted proteins into hydrogels that degraded rapidly in response to red light. Furthermore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were genetically engineered to display CarHC variants, which, alongside in situ Cy5 labeling, led to living materials that could assemble and disassemble in response to AdoB12 and red light, respectively. These results illustrate the CarHC spectrally tuned by optical coupling as a versatile motif for dynamically controlling cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell interactions within engineered living materials.

     alt="Red-Shifting B12-Dependent Photoreceptor Protein via Optical Coupling for Inducible Living Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red-shifting of B12-dependent photoreceptor CarH&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; has been accomplished by labeling with the red light-capturing fluorophore Cy5, which further enables the assembly and disassembly of biomacromolecules or living cells in a B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and red light-dependent manner. This optical coupling approach can potentially be expanded for spectral tuning of other optogenetic tools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalamin (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)-dependent photoreceptors are gaining traction in materials synthetic biology, especially for optically controlling cell-to-cell adhesion in living materials. However, these proteins are mostly responsive to green light, limiting their deep-tissue applications. Here, we present a general strategy for shifting photoresponse of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent photoreceptor CarH&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; from green to red/far-red light via optical coupling. Using thiol-maleimide click chemistry, we labeled cysteine-containing CarH&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; mutants with SulfoCyanine5 (Cy5), a red light-capturing fluorophore. The resulting photoreceptors not only retained the ability to tetramerize in the presence of adenosylcobalamin (AdoB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), but also gained sensitivity to red light; labeled tetramers disassembled on red light exposure. Using genetically encoded click chemistry, we assembled the red-shifted proteins into hydrogels that degraded rapidly in response to red light. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; cells were genetically engineered to display CarH&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; variants, which, alongside in situ Cy5 labeling, led to living materials that could assemble and disassemble in response to AdoB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and red light, respectively. These results illustrate the CarH&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; spectrally tuned by optical coupling as a versatile motif for dynamically controlling cell-to-cell interactions within engineered living materials. Given their prevalence and ecological diversity in nature, this spectral tuning method will expand the use of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent photoreceptors in optogenetics and living materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Modification by Ordered Discotic Liquid Crystals for Thermotolerance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we synthesized a discotic liquid crystal molecule (HAT5) and combined it with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to construct an interface passivation layer. The introduction of HAT5 promotes the transport of holes in PSCs, changing the edge&#8208;on orientation of o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation for charge transfer, inhibiting the migration of o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to the bottom of perovskite, and increasing the activation energy of ion migration. In the end, we achieved a championship efficiency of 25.02&#8201;%. Unpacked PSCs, whether heated at 85&#8201;&#176;C or aged under continuous sunlight for 1008&#8197;hours, can maintain an initial efficiency of over 80&#8201;%.







Abstract
Traditionally used phenylethylamine iodide (PEAI) and its derivatives, such as ortho&#8208;fluorine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, in interfacial modification, are beneficial for perovskite solar cell (PSC) efficiency but vulnerable to heat stability above 85&#8201;&#176;C due to ion migration. To address this issue, we propose a composite interface modification layer incorporating the discotic liquid crystal 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(pentoxy)triphenylene (HAT5) into o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI. The triphenyl core in HAT5 promotes &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly and enhances its interaction with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, forming an oriented columnar phase that improves hole extraction along the one&#8208;dimensional direction. HAT5 repairs structural defects in the interfacial layer and retains the layered structure to inhibit ion migration under heating. Ultimately, our approach increases the efficiency of solar cells from 23.36&#8201;% to 25.02&#8201;%. The thermal stability of the devices retains 80.1&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1008&#8197;hours without encapsulation. Moreover, the optimized PSCs maintained 82.4&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after aging under one sunlight exposure for 1008&#8197;hours. This work provides a simple yet effective strategy using composite materials for interface modification to enhance the thermal and light stability of semiconductor devices.

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution Reactivity of Pentagonal Carbon Rings and p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization Effect with Ru</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological pentagon defects endow carbon nanomaterial with intrinsic hydrogen evolution reactivity and draw forth a strong p&#8208;d orbital hybridization effect with Ru species, which induces favorable electron transfer and weakened hydrogen adsorption strength and reaction barrier of Ru sites, significantly driving electrocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Topological defects are inevitable existence in carbon&#8208;based frameworks, but their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and mechanism remain under&#8208;explored. Herein, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of pentagonal carbon&#8208;rings is probed by constructing pentagonal ring&#8208;rich carbon (PRC), with optimized electronic structures and higher HER activity relative to common hexagonal carbon (HC). Furthermore, to improve the reactivity, we couple Ru clusters with PRC (Ru@PRC) through p&#8208;d orbital hybridization between C and Ru atoms, which drives a shortcut transfer of electrons from Ru clusters to pentagonal rings. The electron&#8208;deficient Ru species leads to a notable negative shift in d&#8208;band centers of Ru and weakens their binding strength with hydrogen intermediates, thus enhancing the HER activity in different pH media. Especially, at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, PRC greatly reduces alkaline HER overpotentials from 540 to 380&#8197;mV. And Ru@PRC even exhibits low overpotentials of 28 and 275&#8197;mV to reach current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Impressively, the mass activity and price activity of Ru@PRC are 7.83 and 15.7&#8197;times higher than that of Pt/C at the overpotential of 50&#8197;mV. Our data unveil the positive HER reactivity of pentagonal defects and good application prospects.

         <title>Oriented Synthesis of Glycine from CO2, N2, and H2O via a Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete production chain was demonstrated for electrorefining glycine directly from air components containing CO2, N2, O2, and H2O. Such a prospective scheme was composed of three modules, linked by a spontaneous C&#8208;N formation process. The full&#8208;path design not only outlines a roadmap for selective C&#8208;N formation but also paves a perspective avenue for green manufacturing and origin&#8208;of&#8208;life research.







Abstract
Air contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen elements that are essential for the constitution of amino acids. Converting the air into amino acids, powered with renewable electricity, provides a green and sustainable alternative to petrochemical&#8208;based methods that produce waste and pollution. Here, taking glycine as an example, we demonstrated the complete production chain for electrorefining amino acids directly from CO2, N2, and H2O. Such a prospective Scheme was composed of three modules, linked by a spontaneous C&#8722;N bond formation process. The high&#8208;purity bridging intermediates, separated from the stepwise synthesis, boosted both the carbon selectivity from CO2 to glycine of 91.7&#8201;% and nitrogen selectivity from N2 to glycine of 98.7&#8201;%. Under the optimum condition, we obtained glycine with a partial current density of 160.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The high&#8208;purity solid glycine product was acquired with a separation efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%. This work unveils a green and sustainable method for the abiotic creation of amino acids from the air components.

         <title>A Thermally Populated Germylene&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A germylene&#8208;based D&#8722;A molecule was synthesized by radical head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization under mild conditions. The coordination of Lewis acids led to intramolecular single electron transfer upon heating to form a thermally populated triplet diradical. This work provided an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species in main group chemistry.







Abstract
This work reports synthesis of a germylene based donor&#8208;acceptor molecule and its thermal excitation to a triplet state by coordination with a Lewis acid. Products have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy, and SQUID measurement, in conjunction with DFT calculation. The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of the donor&#8208;acceptor molecule is dramatically reduced from &#8722;18.8 to &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol by the coordination with B(C6F5)3 (BCF), which enables an intramolecular single electron transfer from one germylene moiety to another upon heating, forming an intramolecular radical ion pair with diradical character. The work provides an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species of heavier main group elements.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports synthesis of a germylene based donor-acceptor molecule and its thermal excitation to a triplet state by coordination with a Lewis acid. Products have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy, and SQUID measurement, in conjunction with DFT calculation. The singlet-triplet energy gap of the donor-acceptor molecule is dramatically reduced from &#8722;18.8 to &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol by the coordination with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BCF), which enables an intramolecular single electron transfer from one germylene moiety to another upon heating, forming an intramolecular radical ion pair with diradical character. The work provides an approach to the formation of thermally populated open-shell species of heavier main group elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution on Heteroatom&#8208;Decorated Carbon Matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
F, N&#8208;doped carbon matrix is selected as the model system to explore the activity origin of carbon towards the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Enriched electrons on O* intermediate can promote the transition from O* to OOH* during OER, fundamentally addressing the rate&#8208;limiting step issue of OOH* generation in carbon materials.







Abstract
Chemical modification via functional dopants in carbon materials holds great promise for elevating catalytic activity and stability. To gain comprehensive insights into the pivotal mechanisms and establish structure&#8208;performance relationships, especially concerning the roles of dopants, remains a pressing need. Herein, we employ computational simulations to unravel the catalytic function of heteroatoms in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), focusing on a physical model of high&#8208;electronegative F and N co&#8208;doped carbon matrix. Theoretical and experimental findings elucidate that the enhanced activity originates from the F and pyridinic&#8208;N (Py&#8722;N) species that achieve carbon activation. This activated carbon significantly lowers the conversion energy barrier from O* to OOH*, shifts the potential&#8208;limiting step from OOH* formation to O* generation, and ultimately optimizes the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;limiting step. This wok elucidates that the critical role of heteroatoms in catalyzing the reaction and unlocks the potential of carbon materials for acidic OER.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Wet Chemistry for the Fast Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Graphyne and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>

Fast gram&#8208;scale production of &#947;&#8208;Graphyne has been successfully achieved by a metal&#8208;free nucleophilic crosslinking wet chemical method. This synthetic strategy shows remarkable tolerance to various functional groups, enabling the preparation of diverse F&#8208;/N&#8208;rich &#947;&#8208;Graphyne derivatives.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Graphyne (GY), an emerging carbon allotrope, is envisioned to offer various alluring properties and broad applicability. While significant progress has been made in the synthesis of GY over recent decades, its widespread application hinges on developing efficient, scalable, and accessible synthetic methods for the production of GY and its derivatives. Here we report a facile metal&#8208;free nucleophilic crosslinking method using wet chemistry for fast gram&#8208;scale production of GY and its derivatives. This synthesis method involves the aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions between fluoro&#8208;(hetero)arenes and alkynyl silanes in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride, where the fluoride plays a crucial role in removing protective groups from alkynyl silanes and generating reactive alkynylides. Our comprehensive analysis of the as&#8208;prepared GY reveals a layered structure, characterized by the presence of the C(sp)&#8722;C(sp2) bond. The synthetic strategy shows remarkable tolerance to various functional groups and enables the preparation of diverse F&#8208;/N&#8208;rich GY derivatives, using electron&#8208;deficient fluoro&#8208;substituted (hetero)arenes as precursors. The feasibility of producing GY and derivatives from fluorinated (hetero)arenes through the metal&#8208;free, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective approach paves the way for broad applications of GY and may inspire the development of new carbon materials.

         <title>An Expedient Route to Bio&#8208;Based Polyacrylate Alternatives with Inherent Post&#8208;Chemical Modification and Degradation Capabilities by Organic Catalysis for Polymerization of Muconate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalyzed group transfer polymerization (O&#8208;GTP) of muconic esters leads to bio&#8208;sourced and degradable polymers analogous to polyacrylates. This O&#8208;GTP method proves ultra&#8208;fast, converting 100&#8201;% of the monomer in one minute in toluene at room temperature. Chemical modification of the internal double bonds offers additional leverage either for modulating polymer properties or for chemical degradation.







Abstract
The quest for polymers that would be at the same time bio&#8208;based and degradable after usage, in addition to offering chemical post&#8208;modification options, remains a daunting challenge in contemporary polymer science. Despite advances in polymer chemistry, attempts at controlling the chain&#8208;growth polymerization of muconate esters remain unexplored. Here we show that dialkyl muconates can be rapidly polymerized by organocatalyzed group transfer polymerization (O&#8208;GTP). O&#8208;GTP is conducted to completion at room temperature in toluene within a few minutes, using 1&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (ETSB) as initiator and 1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4,4,4&#8208;tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis[tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;phosphoranylidenamino]&#8208;2

Furthermore, polymuconates are amenable to facile post&#8208;polymerization modification reactions. This is showcased through the hydrolysis of the ester side chains leading to well&#8208;defined poly(muconic acid), and by epoxidation of the C=C double bonds of the main chain. Last but not least, these internal alkene groups can be selectively cleaved by ozonolysis, demonstrating the upcyclability of polymuconates under oxidative conditions. This work demonstrates that polymuconates constitute a unique platform of bio&#8208;based polymers, easily modifiable in addition to being chemically degradable under user friendly experimental conditions.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Nitric Oxide Modulation via Electrochemical Platform to Profile Tumor Cell Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual nature of nitric oxide (NO) in relation to tumor cells necessitates a precise investigation of the critical concentration window of NO. In this manuscript, we introduce Electrochemical System for Conveyance of Radicals to Tumor cells (ESCoRT) a platform that allows precise control of NO generation through electrochemical nitrite reduction. Our study identifies conditions that induce cytotoxicity, offering valuable insights for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule intricately implicated in oncologic processes, encompassing the modulation of angiogenesis and instigating apoptosis. Investigation of the antitumor effects of NO is currently underway, necessitating a detailed understanding of its cellular&#8208;level reactions. Regulating the behavior of radical NO species has been a significant challenge, primarily due to its instability in aqueous environments by rapid O2&#8208;induced degradation. In this study, we devised an electrochemical platform to investigate the cellular responses to reactive gaseous molecules. Our designed platform precisely controlled the NO flux and diffusion rates of NO to tumor cells. COMSOL Multiphysics calculations based on diffusion and reaction kinetics were conducted to simulate the behavior of electrochemically generated NO. We discerned that the effective radius, NO flux, and electrolysis duration are pivotal factors governing cellular response by NO.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Diversity of Pt&#8722;O Coordination for Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts Achieved by Oriented Atomic Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via proper preparation methods, oriented atomic deposition of Pt is achieved on different facets of truncated CeO2 octahedrons. Normal impregnation results in Pt location on the predominantly exposed {111} plane on the side, while UV photo&#8208;deposition stabilizes Pt atoms in the &#8220;nano&#8208;pockets&#8221; formed at the top {100} plane. Distinct catalytic performance for CO oxidation is found, where the key is the varied Pt&#8722;O coordination environments on different facets determined by the preparation method.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of CeO2 is dictated by the well&#8208;defined facets, which exert great influence on the supported metal species and the catalytic performance. Here we report Pt1/CeO2 catalysts exhibiting specific structures of Pt&#8722;O coordination on different facets by using adequate preparation methods. The simple impregnation method results in Pt&#8722;O3 coordination on the predominantly exposed {111} facets, while the photo&#8208;deposition method achieves oriented atomic deposition for Pt&#8722;O4 coordination into the &#8220;nano&#8208;pocket&#8221; structure of {100} facets at the top. Compared to the impregnated Pt1/CeO2 catalyst showing normal redox properties and low&#8208;temperature activity for CO oxidation, the photo&#8208;deposited Pt1/CeO2 exhibits uncustomary strong metal&#8208;support interaction and extraordinary high&#8208;temperature stability. The preparation methods dictate the facet&#8208;dependent diversity of Pt&#8722;O coordination, resulting in the further activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. By applying specific preparation routes, our work provides an example of disentangling the effects of support facets and coordination environments for nano&#8208;catalysts.

         <title>Thermal Annealing Effects on Long&#8208;Lived Fluorenol Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Styrene Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of doped polymer&#8208;based long&#8208;life RTP systems linked to a PVA matrix via thermal annealing was developed. Additionally, by adjusting the doping proportion and annealing time, blue afterglow that lasts for approximately 30&#8197;s was achieved. Fortunately, a new type of styrene detector was prepared while the cross&#8208;linked network between PVA chains were bridged by 9HMF.







Abstract
Fluorene derivatives have been widely developed in OLEDs because of its efficient fluorescence quantum efficiency, but for which unique rigid biphenyl planar structure and large conjugated system, we hypothesize that they have a great potential for room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) applications, and confirmed this conjecture by subjecting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and phosphors to thermal annealing. The cross&#8208;linked structure formed during thermal annealing judiciously modulates the phosphorescence emission characteristics of the fluorenol with the synergistic interaction between PVA and fluorenol. Specifically, the lifetime exhibited a substantial increase from 1352.2&#8197;ms to 2874.1&#8197;ms, accompanied by a quantum yield augmentation from 4.8&#8201;% to 11.3&#8201;%, which substantiate that cross&#8208;linked induced by thermal annealing effectively amplifies the phosphorescent intensity and stability of the phosphors, facilitating ultralong phosphorescent emission at ambient conditions. Furthermore, an effective probe based on this film is developed for its highly sensitive, quantitative and immediate detection of volatile organic compounds. This investigation not only proffers a novel paradigm for the development of advanced RTP materials but also imparts insightful considerations for optimizing the performance of polymers in conjunction with functional materials, encompassing bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Constructing Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Controlled Desilication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As compared with the conventional alkaline treatment, iPDAs&#8208;assisted desilication allows to break the porosity and acidity trade&#8208;off and build an efficient and orchestrated hierarchical system in zeolites with highly complete framework, opening new avenues to construction of hierarchical zeolites especially with low aluminum stability or high Si/Al ratio.







Abstract
Desilication in alkaline medium has been widely used in construction of hierarchical zeolites for industrially relevant catalytic processes. The built of hierarchy in zeolites, especially with low aluminum stability or high Si/Al ratio, often suffers from uncontrolled destruction of zeolitic framework, accompanied by a significant loss of microporous domains and intrinsic acidity after desilication. Here, we report a novel and simple methodology for preparation of hierarchical zeolites with highly complete framework and minimum sacrifice of microporosity and acidity. The pre&#8208;impregnated amines in zeolite micropores act as inner pore&#8208;directing agents (iPDAs), largely protecting the zeolitic framework and moderating the silicon extraction during the alkaline treatment. The resulting hierarchical zeolites exhibit high crystallinity, tunable hierarchy, stable framework, and well&#8208;preserved acidity, endowing them with significantly improved mass transport properties and enhanced activities in catalytic conversion of methanol or furfural.

GeoSeqBuilder successfully design sequences that fold to the desired protein target structures with atomic consistence.







Abstract
Designing sequences for specific protein backbones is a key step in creating new functional proteins. Here, we introduce GeoSeqBuilder, a deep learning framework that integrates protein sequence generation with side chain conformation prediction to produce the complete all&#8208;atom structures for designed sequences. GeoSeqBuilder uses spatial geometric features from protein backbones and explicitly includes three&#8208;body interactions of neighboring residues. GeoSeqBuilder achieves native residue type recovery rate of 51.6&#8201;%, comparable to ProteinMPNN and other leading methods, while accurately predicting side chain conformations. We first used GeoSeqBuilder to design sequences for thioredoxin and a hallucinated three&#8208;helical bundle protein. All the 15 tested sequences expressed as soluble monomeric proteins with high thermal stability, and the 2 high&#8208;resolution crystal structures solved closely match the designed models. The generated protein sequences exhibit low similarity (minimum 23&#8201;%) to the original sequences, with significantly altered hydrophobic cores. We further redesigned the hydrophobic core of glutathione peroxidase 4, and 3 of the 5 designs showed improved enzyme activity. Although further testing is needed, the high experimental success rate in our testing demonstrates that GeoSeqBuilder is a powerful tool for designing novel sequences for predefined protein structures with atomic details. GeoSeqBuilder is available at https://github.com/PKUliujl/GeoSeqBuilder.

         <title>Understanding the Wettability of C1N1 (Sub)Nanopores: Implications for Porous Carbonaceous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The common paradigm that water easily enters hydrophilic pores does not apply to C1N1 nanopores of size below a few nanometers. Using solid&#8208;state NMR, we unravel that only a negligible portion of water can enter the nanopores of C1N1 despite their hydrophilic character. In contrast, water enters similar pores of hydrophobic pure carbon material.







Abstract
Understanding how water interacts with nanopores of carbonaceous electrodes is crucial for energy storage and conversion applications. A high surface area of carbonaceous materials does not necessarily need to translate to a high electrolyte&#8208;solid interface area. Herein, we study the interaction of water with nanoporous C1N1 materials to explain their very low specific capacitance in aqueous electrolytes despite their high surface area. Water was used to probe chemical environments, provided by pores of different sizes, in 1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR experiments. We observe that regardless of their high hydrophilicity, only a negligible portion of water can enter the nanopores of C1N1, in contrast to a reference pure carbon material with a similar pore structure. The common paradigm that water easily enters hydrophilic pores does not apply to C1N1 nanopores below a few nanometers. Calorimetric and sorption experiments demonstrated strong water adsorption on the C1N1 surface, which restricts water mobility across the interface and impedes its penetration into the nanopores.

Calorimetric and sorption experiments demonstrated strong water adsorption on the C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; surface, which restricts water mobility across the interface and impedes its penetration into the nanopores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanomaterial with Organelle&#8208;Level Precision Primes Antitumor Immunity via mtDNA&#8208;dependent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present a strategy of targeting excessive mtDNA damages by the synergistic action of mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT&#8208;induced oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking, which leads to more release of mtDNA fragments and synergies with Mn2+ in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to significantly repolarized M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype in a STING&#8208;dependent manner. We envision that our metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial offers an attractive tool for initiating robust antitumor immunity at the organelle level.







Abstract
New generation of nanomaterials with organelle&#8208;level precision provide significant promise for targeted attacks on mitochondria, exhibiting remarkable therapeutic potency. Here, we report a novel amphiphilic phenolic polymer (PF) for the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can trigger excessive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage by the synergistic action of oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking. Moreover, the phenolic units on PF enable further self&#8208;assembly with Mn2+ via metal&#8208;phenolic coordination to form metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial (PFM). We focus on the synergistic activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by Mn2+ and tumor&#8208;derived mtDNA in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), and subsequently repolarizing M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype. We highlight that PFM facilitates the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;dependent immunity at the organelle level for potent antitumor efficacy.

         <title>Fabrication of Scalable Covalent Organic Framework Membrane&#8208;based Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large free&#8208;standing PEG&#8208;COF membrane (COM) has been fabricated to serve as a polymer electrolyte for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. By adjusting the lengths of PEG chains within the framework, a satisfactory ion conductivity of 0.153&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C was achieved. Benefiting from the collaborative effect of guest&#8208;promoted transport, the Li|Li, Li|LFP, and pouch cell assemblies with PEG&#8208;COM polymer electrolytes demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The conventional covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based electrolytes with tailored ionic conducting behaviors are typically fabricated in the powder morphology, requiring further compaction procedures to operate as solid electrolyte tablets, which hinders the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of COF materials. In this study, we present a feasible electrospinning strategy to prepare scalable, self&#8208;supporting COF membranes (COMs) that feature a rigid COF skeleton bonded with flexible, lithiophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, forming an ion conduction network for Li+ transport. The resulting PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes exhibit enhanced dendrite inhibition and high ionic conductivity of 0.153&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The improved Li+ conduction in PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes stems from the loose ion pairing in the structure and the production of higher free Li+ content, as confirmed by solid&#8208;state 7Li NMR experiments. These changes in the local microenvironment of Li+ facilitate its directional movement within the COM pores. Consequently, solid&#8208;state symmetrical Li|Li, Li|LFP, and pouch cells demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy offers a universal approach for constructing scalable COM&#8208;based electrolytes, thereby broadening the practical applications of COFs in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Interfacial Thermoconvection and Atomic Relay Catalysis Enable Equilibrium Shifting and Rapid Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;Fructose Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by interfacial local thermoconvection is developed to significantly bypass the chemical equilibrium limit for glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization. The synergy of isolated and geminal K single atoms and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect can accelerate photothermal glucose isomerization, affording a high fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% with carbon balance of 95.9&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min at room temperature.







Abstract
The aqueous glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization is controlled by thermodynamics to an equilibrium limit of ~50&#8201;% fructose yield. However, here we report an in situ fructose removal strategy enabled by an interfacial local photothermal effect in combination with relay catalysis of geminal and isolated potassium single atoms (K SAs) on graphene&#8208;type carbon (Ksg/GT) to effectively bypass the equilibrium limit and markedly speed up glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, an unprecedented fructose yield of 68.2&#8201;% was obtained over Ksg/GT in an aqueous solution without any additives under 30&#8208;min solar&#8208;like irradiation. Mechanistic studies expounded that the interfacial thermoconvection caused by the local photothermal effect of the graphene&#8208;type carbon and preferable glucose adsorption on single&#8208;atom K could facilitate the release of in situ formed fructose. The geminal K SAs were prone to form a stable metal&#8208;glucose complex via bidentate coordination, and could significantly reduce the C&#8722;H bond electron density by light&#8208;driven electron transfer toward K. This facilitated the hydride shift rate&#8208;determining step and expedited glucose isomerization. In addition, isolated K SAs favored the subsequent protonation and ring&#8208;closure process to furnish fructose. The integration of the interfacial thermoconvection&#8208;enhanced in situ removal protocol and tailored atomic catalysis opens a prospective avenue for boosting equilibrium&#8208;limited reactions under mild conditions.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports the synthesis of chiral tetrahydroquinolines (THQs) through one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascades that use up to four enzymes. This highly efficient method demonstrates the preparation of a wide range of enantiocomplementary 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl substituted THQs in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) framework is commonly found in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Apart from using transition metal catalysts and chiral phosphoric acids, the chiral 2&#8208;substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs are synthesized using amine oxidase biocatalysts. However, the use of imine reductases (IREDs) in their asymmetric synthesis remained unexplored. In the current work, IREDs are employed in telescopic multienzyme cascades to catalyze the intramolecular reductive amination leading to chiral 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines starting from inexpensive nitroalkenones. The cascades containing NtDBR (an ene reductase), NfsB (a nitro reductase) with either Na2S2O4 or V2O5, various IREDs, and glucose dehydrogenase (for NADPH regeneration) are used to synthesize a broad range of (R)/(S)&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted (THQs) (26 examples) with high yield (up to 93&#8201;%) and excellent ee (up to 99&#8201;%) in one&#8208;pot. The method further facilitates the one&#8208;pot biocatalytic synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;aryl substituted THQs (26 examples) from amino chalcones. Lastly, the asymmetric synthesis of several (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;THQ based intermediates of Hancock alkaloids showed the practical application of the newly developed biocatalytic cascades.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phosphonate&#8208;Organic Network as Ion Enrichment Layer for Sustainable Zinc Metal Electrode with High Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion enriching features of the spontaneously constructed metal&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;organic network (MPON) on Zn metal facilitates rapid and uniform transport of Zn&#8208;ions as well as inhibit parasitic reactions of Zn electrode, which greatly improves the reversibility of Zn anode and Zn&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions.







Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal batteries could be the technology of choice for sustainable battery chemistries owing to its better safety and cost advantage. However, their cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE) are strongly limited by the dendritic growth and side reactions of Zn anodes. Herein, we proposed an in situ construction of a metal&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;organic network (MPON) with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected networks on Zn metal, which can act as an ion enrichment layer for Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;metal batteries. This MPON with abundant porous structure and phosphate sites possesses ion enriching properties and high Zn2+ transference number (0.83), which is beneficial for enhancing Zn2+ migration and self&#8208;concentrating kinetics. Meanwhile, MPON offers hydrophobicity to effectively inhibit the water&#8208;induced Zn anode corrosion. As a result, the Zn electrode exhibits superior Zn/Zn2+ reversibility of over 4&#8197;months at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high CE of 99.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the Zn/NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O and Zn/MnO2 full cells using ultrathin Zn anodes (10&#8197;&#956;m) exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 81&#8201;% and 78&#8201;% after 1400 and 1000&#8197;cycles, respectively. This work provides a unique promise to design high&#8208;performance anode for practical Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>A Regenerable Bi&#8208;Based Catalyst for Efficient and Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs, enriched with Bi/Cu&#8722;O bonds, is electrochemically transformed from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs and exhibits exceptional performance in converting CO2 to formate at industrial current densities. In stability test, the effective repetitive electrochemical treatments extend the selectivity for formate to 90&#8201;% for up to 400&#8197;h.







Abstract
Renewable electricity shows immense potential as a driving force for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in production of formate (HCOO&#8722;) at industrial current density, providing a promising path for value&#8208;added chemicals and chemical manufacturing. However, achieving high selectivity and stable production of HCOO&#8722; at industrial current density remains a challenge. Here, we present a robust Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs catalyst capable of regenerating necessary catalytic core (Bi&#8722;O) through cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment. Notably, at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiency of HCOO&#8722; reaches an exceptional selectivity to 99.23&#8201;%, maintaining above 90&#8201;% even after 400&#8197;h, which is longest reaction time reported at the industrial current density. Furthermore, in stability test, the catalyst was constructed by CV reconstruction to achieve stable and efficient production of HCOO&#8722;. In 20&#8197;h reaction test, the catalyst has a rate of HCOO&#8722; production of 13.24&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1, a HCOO&#8722; concentration of 1.91&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1, and an energy consumption of 129.80&#8197;kWh&#8201;kmol&#8722;1. In&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of Bi&#8722;O structure during the gradual transformation of catalyst from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs to Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs. Theoretical studies highlight the pivotal role of Bi&#8722;O structure in modifying the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, which further reduces energy barrier for *OCHO conversion in CO2RR.

         <title>Self&#8208;Initiated Nano&#8208;Micelles Mediated Covalent Modification of mRNA for Labeling and Treatment of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving in situ spontaneous and precise mRNA covalent modification can effectively interfere with the translation of mRNA in tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. The linked Luminol and Ce6 generated 1O2 in situ by CRET and furan&#8208;mediated covalent modification of mRNAs was triggered for RNA interference in situ. This strategy offers novel insights into in situ RNA interference.







Abstract
As a promising gene therapy strategy, controllable small molecule&#8208;mRNA covalent modification in tumor cells could be initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) to complete the modification process. However, in vivo generation of 1O2 is usually dependent on excitation of external light, and the limited light penetration of tissues greatly interferes the development of deep tumor photo therapy. Here, we constructed a tumor&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;micelle for the spontaneous intracellular generation of 1O2 without the need for external light, and inducing a high level of covalent modification of mRNA in tumor cells. Luminol and Ce6 were chemically bonded to produce 1O2 by chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) triggered by high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The sufficient 1O2 oxidized the loaded furan to highly reactive dicarbonyl moiety, which underwent cycloaddition reaction with adenine (A), cytosine (C) or guanine (G) on the mRNA for interfering with the tumor cell protein expression, thereby inhibiting tumor progression. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this self&#8208;initiated gene therapy nano&#8208;micelle could induce covalent modification of mRNA by 1O2 without external light, and the process could be monitored in real time by fluorescence imaging, which provided an effective strategy for RNA&#8208;based tumor gene therapy.

         <title>A Graded Redox Interfacial Modifier for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin oxide is a widely employed charge&#8208;transport material for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. In this work, a graded redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, is found to improve the properties of tin oxide. It reduces the interfacial defect density and improving the crystallinity of the perovskite. The resultant perovskite solar cells show excellent stability under elevated temperatures.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a potential competitor to the silicon photovoltaic technology. The most representative perovskite cells employ SnO2 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as the charge&#8208;transport materials. Despite their high efficiencies, perovskite cells with such a configuration show unsatisfactory lifespan, normally attributed to the instability of perovskites and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Limited attention was paid to the influence of SnO2, an inorganic material, on device stability. Here we show that improving SnO2 with a redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, simultaneously enhances the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells. Redox reactions between the bivalent cobalt complexes and oxygen lead to the formation of a graded distribution of trivalent and bivalent cobalt complexes across the surface and bulk regions of the SnO2. The trivalent cobalt complex at the top surface of SnO2 raises the concentration of (SO3NH2)&#8722; which passivates uncoordinated Pb2+ and relieves tensile stress, facilitating the formation of perovskite with improved crystallinity.

     alt="A Graded Redox Interfacial Modifier for High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin oxide is a widely employed charge-transport material for high-performance perovskite solar cells. In this work, a graded redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, is found to improve the properties of tin oxide. It reduces the interfacial defect density and improving the crystallinity of the perovskite. The resultant perovskite solar cells show excellent stability under elevated temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a potential competitor to the silicon photovoltaic technology. The most representative perovskite cells employ SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and spiro-OMeTAD as the charge-transport materials. Despite their high efficiencies, perovskite cells with such a configuration show unsatisfactory lifespan, normally attributed to the instability of perovskites and spiro-OMeTAD. Limited attention was paid to the influence of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an inorganic material, on device stability. Here we show that improving SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, simultaneously enhances the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells. Redox reactions between the bivalent cobalt complexes and oxygen lead to the formation of a graded distribution of trivalent and bivalent cobalt complexes across the surface and bulk regions of the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The trivalent cobalt complex at the top surface of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; raises the concentration of (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; which passivates uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and relieves tensile stress, facilitating the formation of perovskite with improved crystallinity. Our approach enables perovskite cells with PCEs of up to 24.91&#8201;%. The devices retained 93.8&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#8197;hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking. These findings showcase the potential of cobalt complexes as redox interfacial modifiers for high-performance perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Customized Strategy Realizes Stable Cycle of Large&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Voltage Layered Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A concept of customized strategy via multiple rock&#8208;forming elements trace doping is presented to solve the stability&#8211;capacity trade&#8208;off dilemma of layered oxide for high&#8208;voltage sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The designed Na0.67Ni0.28Mg0.04Al0.02Mn0.64Ti0.02O2 cathode exhibits high energy density approaching 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, with good capacity retention of 81.2&#8201;% after 200 cycles. The full cell delivers a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy density of 303.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 layered oxide cathode exhibits significant potential for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to the elevated operating voltage and theoretical energy density beyond lithium iron phosphate, but the large&#8208;volume phase transition is the devil. Currently, this type cathode still suffers from stability&#8211;capacity trade&#8208;off dilemma. Herein, a concept of customized strategy via multiple rock&#8208;forming elements trace doping is presented to address the mentioned issue. The customized Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;Ti trace doped cathode maintains a notable capacity of 140.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an energy density approaching 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and shows good cycle stability, retaining 89.0&#8201;% of its capacity after 50 cycles at 0.1&#8197;C. Additionally, the full cell, paired with a hard carbon anode, achieves an advanced energy density of 303.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The multiple characterizations reveal the failure mechanism of contrast sample involving severe intragranular cracks coupled with layer to rock salt transformation, which reduces active substance and increases charge transfer resistance. The doped sample with increased sliding energy barrier well suppresses this phenomenon. Impressively, the customized strategy can be extended to Mg&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ti system. This research provides a novel concept for the design of high energy sodium&#8208;ion cathode.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Chiral Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films with Full&#8208;Color Tunable Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing self&#8208;standing chiral covalent organic framework (CCOF) thin films with controllable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance but remains challenging. Here, we present the fabrication of self&#8208;standing CCOF thin films via a polymerization&#8208;dispersion&#8208;filtration strategy. With preferentially oriented chiral pores, these films show excellent full&#8208;color&#8208;tunable guest&#8208;induced CPL performances.







Abstract
Exploring self&#8208;standing chiral covalent organic framework (COF) thin films with controllable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of paramount significance but remains a challenging task. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of self&#8208;standing chiral COF films employing a polymerization&#8208;dispersion&#8208;filtration strategy. Pristine, low&#8208;quality chiral COF films were produced by interfacial polymerization and then re&#8208;dispersed into COF colloidal solutions. Via vacuum assisted assembly, these COF colloids were densely stacked and assembled into self&#8208;standing, pure chiral COF films (L&#8208;/D&#8208;CCOF&#8208;F) that were transparent, smooth, crack&#8208;free and highly crystalline. These films were tunable in thicknesses, areas, and roughness, along with strong diffuse reflectance circular dichroism (DRCD) and cyan CPL signals, showing an intrinsic luminescence asymmetric factor (glum) of ~4.3&#215;10&#8722;3. Furthermore, these COF films served as host adsorbents to load various achiral organic dye guests through adsorption. The effective chiral transfer and energy transfer between CCOF&#8208;F and achiral fluorescent dyes endowed the dyes with strong chirality and tunable DRCD, resulting in intense, full&#8208;color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state CPL. Notably, the ordered arrangement of dye guest molecules within the preferentially oriented chiral pores of CCOF&#8208;F contributed to an amplified |glum| factor of up to 7.2&#215;10&#8722;2, which is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for COF&#8208;based CPL materials. This work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of self&#8208;standing chiral COF films, demonstrating their great potential for chiroptical applications.

         <title>Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Aminoboration of Alkynes and the Critical Role of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By probing the importance of electronics in alkynes for activating the B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond of aminoboranes and aminoboronic esters, we here demonstrate the first intermolecular 1,2&#8208;aminoboration of alkynes, affording syn&#8208;addition alkene products with the incorporation of two key functionalities, namely, amino and boryl.







Abstract
The intramolecular 1,2&#8208;aminoboration of alkynes by aminoboranes is rare and invariably requires a catalyst to proceed, while the intermolecular aminoboration of alkynes is yet entirely unknown. Through an exploration of the significance of electronics in alkynes for activating the B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond of aminoboranes, we demonstrate in this work the first intermolecular 1,2&#8208;aminoboration of alkynes. These reactions employ a series of (amino)dihaloboranes and aminoboronic esters, mild reaction conditions, and no catalysts, yielding syn&#8208;addition alkene products with the incorporation of two crucial functionalities: amino and boryl. While highly electron&#8208;rich examples can afford the aminoborated products (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;borylethenamines, other alkynes, including unactivated and less electron&#8208;rich examples, do not lead to the corresponding aminoborated products due to the fundamental impediment that the reactions are significantly endergonic.

A versatile method for laser&#8208;induced precise 2D&#8208;functionalization of graphene using multifunctional trivalent iodine compounds is developed, allowing for complex and customized molecular engineering of the graphene surface. The tailor&#8208;made and reversible attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties enables programming the surface properties of graphene, paving the way for advanced nanoelectronics.







Abstract
The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)&#8208;patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine&#8208;centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser&#8208;induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D&#8208;structuring of this 2D&#8208;film. The tailor&#8208;made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.

         <title>Visualizing Active Sites in Electrospun Photoactive Membranes via Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making invisible&#8208;visible: In this study, we used electrospinning to create photoactive membranes from hydrophobic PCL and hydrophilic PAN, embedded with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic photosensitizer. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging we identified photoexcited &#8220;active sites&#8221; within the membranes, thereby establishing a causal link between material activity and the photosensitizer&#8216;s microenvironment.







Abstract
Interest in antibacterial nanomaterials has surged in recent years, driven by the rise in antibiotic resistance among microbes. However, their practical application remains limited because many crucial properties have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we have developed novel nanofibrous membranes based on hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) or hydrophobic polycaprolactone (PCL) with embedded hydrophilic or hydrophobic zinc(II)phthalocyanines (ZnPcs) as photosensitizers and investigated their water disinfection properties. Several key characteristics were evaluated to link the activity of the material and composition/structure. As demonstrated by reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopy, the aggregation states of dyes within the polymer support vary significantly. We have proposed and validated the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) for visualizing &#8220;active sites&#8221; in the membranes. The results of this study provide useful insights for the engineering of photoactive nanomaterials with tailor&#8208;made properties and highlight the crucial role of the nature of polymeric support in modulating the material&#8216;s activity.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Negishi Cross&#8208;Couplings of Racemic Secondary Organozinc Reagents to Access Privileged Scaffolds: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioconvergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling of aryl electrophiles with racemic secondary organozinc reagents has been developed. This transformation enables access to enantioenriched 1,1&#8208;diaryl motifs in good yields and high enantioselectivities. A detailed computational study has been conducted to fully understand the reaction mechanism and the mechanism of C&#8722;Zn bond inversion.







Abstract
An enantioconvergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling with racemic secondary organozinc reagents has been developed, enabling access to enantioenriched 1,1&#8208;diarylalkane motifs in high yields and enantioselectivities. Computational data indicates that the racemization of organozinc compounds most likely occurs through a bridged bimolecular mechanism.

         <title>Wavy Graphene Nanoribbons Containing Periodic Eight&#8208;Membered Rings for Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavy graphene nanoribbon (wGNR) that incorporates periodic eight&#8208;membered rings into its backbone has been synthesized through bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis. This distinctive non&#8208;planar geometry gives wGNR excellent dispersibility in solution and unlocks its emissive features, making it an emissive layer for organic light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells.







Abstract
Precision graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) offer distinctive physicochemical properties that are highly dependent on their geometric topologies, thereby holding great potential for applications in carbon&#8208;based optoelectronics and spintronics. While the edge structure and width control has been a popular strategy for engineering the optoelectronic properties of GNRs, non&#8208;hexagonal&#8208;ring&#8208;containing GNRs remain underexplored due to synthetic challenges, despite offering an equally high potential for tailored properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of a wavy GNR (wGNR) by embedding periodic eight&#8208;membered rings into its carbon skeleton, which is achieved by the A2B2&#8208;type Diels&#8211;Alder polymerization between dibenzocyclooctadiyne (6) and dicyclopenta[e,l]pyrene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione derivative (8), followed by a selective Scholl reaction of the obtained ladder&#8208;type polymer (LTP) precursor. The obtained wGNR, with a length of up to 30&#8197;nm, has been thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis spectroscopy with the support of DFT calculations. The non&#8208;planar geometry of wGNR efficiently prevents the inter&#8208;ribbon &#960;&#8211;&#960; aggregation, leading to photoluminescence in solution. Consequently, the wGNR can function as an emissive layer for organic light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (OLECs), offering a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept exploration in implementing luminescent GNRs into optoelectronic devices. The fast&#8208;responding OLECs employing wGNR will pave the way for advancements in OLEC technology and other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Cryptophycin Derivatives with Modification in Unit D for Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytotoxic cryptophycins with versatile conjugation handles in unit D are accessible by a highly efficient and scalable synthetic route. This ABC+D strategy enabled the creation of a vast array of cryptophycins leading to a quantitative structure activity relationship, allowing for the synthesis of most potent conjugable cryptophycin derivatives being superb candidates for the employment in drug conjugates.







Abstract
Cytotoxic payloads for drug conjugates suitable for directed tumor therapy need to be highly potent and require a functional group for conjugation with the homing device (antibody, peptide, or small molecule). Cryptophycins are cyclodepsipeptides that stand out from the realm of natural products due to their extraordinarily high cytotoxicity. However, the installation of a suitable conjugation handle without compromising the toxicity is highly challenging. The unit D, natively 2&#8208;hydroxyisocaproic acid (leucic acid), was envisaged as a promising attachment site based on structural information from X&#8208;ray analysis. A versatile, scalable and efficient synthetic route towards conjugable cryptophycins with modification in unit D was developed and an array of new cryptophycin analogues was synthesized. Several derivatives, especially those containing lipophilic groups with low steric demand such as alkylated amino groups, exhibit low picomolar cytotoxicity often combined with efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant tumor cells. The newly established cryptophycin analogues comprise a broad range of relevant functional groups used as conjugation handles, among them amino, hydroxy, carboxy, as well as sulfur&#8208;containing derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a tubulin&#8208;bound cryptophycin together with quantitative structure activity relationship manifested rationales for the synthesis of most potent cryptophycin derivatives and further confirmed the suitability of modifications in unit D.

         <title>Photocatalytic PPh3&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C3&#8208;Functionalized Indoles via Radical Annulation of Nitroarenes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economic and highly efficient synthesis of indole derivatives was developed through a photocatalytic radical annulation process of nitroarenes and alkenes. A series of valuable C3&#8208;functionalized indoles were prepared with cheap and commercially available nitroarenes as nitrogen sources via a PPh3&#8208;mediated radical deoxygenation process at room temperature.







Abstract
Oxidatively generated phosphine radical cations are reactive intermediates that can be used for the generation of carbon and heteroatom centered radicals via deoxygenation processes. Such P&#8208;radical cations can readily be generated via single electron transfer oxidation using a redox catalyst. Cheap and commercially available nitroarenes are ideal nitrogen sources for the construction of organic amines and N&#8208;containing heterocycles. Activation of nitroarenes with phosphines has been achieved in the ionic mode, which requires specially designed P&#8208;nucleophiles and high temperatures. Herein, we report an alternative mode of nitro activation that proceeds via a radical process. The radical strategy leads to open shell intermediates that show interesting unexplored reactivity. This is documented by the development of an economic and highly efficient synthesis of valuable indole derivatives through photocatalytic PPh3&#8208;mediated annulation of nitroarenes with alkenes showing large functional group tolerance. The method allows room&#8208;temperature activation of nitroarenes and a double C&#8722;H bond functionalization of alkenes is achieved to provide rapid access to C3&#8208;functionalized indoles, which are key structural components of diverse natural and drug molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies that are further supported by DFT calculations indicate that a nitrosoarene radical cation plays a key role in the annulation process.

         <title>Micro/Meso&#8208;Porous Double&#8208;Shell Hollow Carbon Spheres through Spatially Confined Pyrolysis for Supercapacitors and Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique confined pyrolysis method has been used for the creation of a hollow structure with a dual shell structure consisting of both microporous and mesoporous features. Basing on the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor is established.







Abstract
Energy storage in supercapacitors and hybrid zinc ion capacitors (ZIC) using porous carbon materials offers a promising alternative method for clean energy solutions. The unique combination of hierarchical porous structure and nitrogen doping in these materials has demonstrated significant capacity for energy storage. Nevertheless, the full potential of these materials, particularly the relationship between pore structure configuration and performance, remains underexplored. Herein, a confined pyrolysis strategy based on the polymerization characteristics of polydopamine (PDA) was developed to construction of hollow carbon spheres with microporous/mesoporous dual shell structure. The depth of micropores and cavity can be controlled by adjusting the duration of heat treatment and hydrothermal treatment, in accordance with the decomposition and polymerization characteristics of PDA. Due to the elasticity of this structure, the relationship between the micro/mesoporous depth of the prepared carbon spheres and the energy storage performance in supercapacitors and ZIC is established. Through optimizing the ion transport capacity of carbon spheres and considering the influence of its internal cavity structure on energy storage, the resulting carbon spheres exhibit high specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in supercapacitor and specific capacitance of 260&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent stability with 99.3&#8201;% retention after 30000&#8197;chare/discharge cycles in ZIC.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring in PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 Organic&#8211;inorganic Hybrid Metal Halide via Rigid Benzene Ring Induced Local Lattice Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of combining organic compunds PMA+ (C7H10N+) with the inorganic [NaCl6]&#8208;[InCl6] layer to form a novel and highly efficient luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide PMA4NaInCl8 (PNIC) with Sb3+ doping. The dual emission of PNIC:Sb3+ can be adjusted from cyan to yellow by multimode regulation of temperature and excitation energy.







Abstract
Low dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halide materials have attracted extensive attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by parity&#8208;forbidden transition hinder their further application in optoelectronic devices. Herein, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 (C7H10N+, PMA+) low&#8208;dimensional OIMHs single crystal with a PLQY as high as 88&#8201;% was successfully designed and synthesized, originating from the fact that the doping of Sb3+ effectively relaxes the parity&#8208;forbidden transition by strong spin&#8208;orbit (SO) coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) interaction. The as&#8208;prepared crystal shows an efficient dual emission peaking 495 and 560&#8197;nm at low temperature, which are ascribed to different levels of 3P1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Sb3+ in [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral caused by JT deformation. Moreover, wide&#8208;range luminescence tailoring from cyan to orange can be achieved through adjusting excitation energy and temperature because of flexible [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral in the PNIC lattice. Based on a relative stiff lattice environment, the 560&#8197;nm yellow emission under 350&#8197;nm light excitation exhibits abnormal anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 8 to 400&#8197;K owing to the suppression of non&#8208;radiative transition. The multimode luminescence regulation enriches PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 great potential in the field of optoelectronics such as temperature sensing, low temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and WLED applications.

         <title>Dimerized M&#8208;Series Acceptors with Low Diffusion Coefficients for Efficient and Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ADA&#8208;type small molecule acceptor is used to construct a dimerized acceptor (DMT&#8208;HF) which is featured with a high glass transition temperature and a low diffusion coefficient. When blended with a wide band gap copolymer, the resulting DMT&#8208;HF&#8208;based polymer solar cell exhibits an excellent efficiency of 17.17&#8201;% and outstanding thermal stability.







Abstract
As the simplest oligomeric acceptors, dimerized acceptors (DAs) are easier to synthesize, and more importantly, they can retain good intermolecular interaction and photovoltaic properties of their parent small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs). Nevertheless, currently most efficient DAs are derived from banana&#8208;shaped acceptors and they might suffer from inferior device stability with high diffusion coefficients. Herein, we design and synthesize two planar DAs (DMT&#8208;FH and DMT&#8208;HF) by bridging two linear&#8208;shaped M&#8208;series SMAs with a thiophene unit. The effects of fluorination position on the diffusion coefficients, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and stability of the DAs are systematically studied. Our results suggest that DMT&#8208;HF with fluorination on the ending indanone groups shows enhanced intermolecular interactions, improved PCE and stability compared with the counterpart (DMT&#8208;FH) with fluorination on the central indanone groups. Further optimization on the DMT&#8208;HF&#8208;based devices yields an outstanding PCE of 17.17&#8201;%, which is the highest among all linear&#8208;shaped SMA&#8208;based DAs. Notably, with the low diffusion coefficient (3.36&#215;10&#8722;24&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) of DMT&#8208;HF, the resulting device retains over 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 5000&#8197;h of continuous heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C, suggesting its excellent thermal stability. The results highlight the importance of intermolecular interaction and fluorination for achieving efficient and stable polymer solar cells.

Using intentional glycosylation effects and protein folding chemistry for regioselective peptide&#8208;bacbone activation, a new bioinspired semisynthesis method can yield an undiscovered potent bioactive IL6&#8208;derivative.







Abstract
A bioinspired semisynthesis of human&#8208;interleukin&#8208;6 bearing N&#8208;glycan at Asn143 (143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6) was performed by intentional glycosylation effects and protein folding chemistry for regioselective peptide&#8208;backbone activation. 143Glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 is a genetically coded cytokine, but isolation was difficult owing to a tiny amount. IL6&#8208;polypeptide (1&#8211;141&#8208;position) with an intentionally inserted cysteine at 142&#8208;position was expressed in E. coli. The expressed polypeptide was treated with a chemical folding process to make a specific helices bundle conformation through native two&#8208;disulfide bonds (43&#8211;49 and 72&#8211;82). Utilizing the successfully formed free&#8208;142&#8208;cysteine, sequential conversions using cyanylation of 142&#8208;cysteine, hydrazinolysis, and thioesterification created a long polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester. However, the resultant polypeptide&#8208;thioester caused considerable aggregation owing to a highly hydrophobic peptide sequence. After the reduction of two&#8208;disulfide bonds of polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester, an unprecedented hydrophilic N&#8208;glycan tag was inserted at the resultant cysteine thiols. The N&#8208;glycan tags greatly stabilized polypeptide&#8208;thioester. The subsequent native chemical ligation and desulfurization successfully gave a whole 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 polypeptide (183&#8208;amino acids). Removal of four N&#8208;glycan tags and immediate one&#8208;pot in vitro folding protocol efficiently produced the folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6. The folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 exhibited potent cell proliferation activity. The combined studies with molecular dynamics simulation, semisynthesis, and bioassays predict the bioactive conformation of latent 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6.

Utilizing the successfully formed free-142-cysteine, sequential conversions using cyanylation of 142-cysteine, hydrazinolysis, and thioesterification created a long polypeptide (1&#8211;141)-thioester.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Mediated Structural Interchange Between Pd6 and Pd12 Architectures: Selective Recognition of E&#8208;Stilbene by the Pd6 Architecture and its Photoprotection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble trifacial barrel (C1) was synthesized which undergoes transformation into a triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) upon application of various stimuli. In aqueous media, C1 selectively encapsulates the E&#8208;isomer of stilbene (tS) and prevented its photobleaching to the Z&#8208;isomer (cS) under UV light. Conversely, C1 facilitated the reverse isomerization of cS to tS under visible light by stabilizing tS within its hydrophobic cavity.







Abstract
The dynamic behaviour of metal&#8208;ligand bonding cultivates stimuli&#8208;mediated structural transformations in self&#8208;assembled molecular architectures. The propensity of synthetically designed self&#8208;assembled systems to interchange between higher&#8208;order architectures is increased multi&#8208;fold when the building blocks have higher conformational degrees of freedom. Herein, we report a new ligand, (2,7&#8208;bis(di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one) (L), which, upon self&#8208;assembly with a cis&#8208;[(ethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine)Pd(NO3)2] acceptor (M), resulted in the formation of a M6L3 trifacial barrel (C1) in water. Interestingly, during crystallization, a rare M12L6 triangular orthobicupola architecture (C2) was generated along with C1. C2 could also be generated in solution via the application of several stimuli. C1 in aqueous media could stabilize one trans&#8208;stilbene (tS) or cis&#8208;stilbene (cS) molecule in its cavity, with a selectivity for the former from their mixture. Moreover, C1 acted as an effective host to prevent the otherwise facile photoisomerization of tS to cS inside its hydrophobic cavity under UV irradiation. Conversely, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reverse isomerization of encapsulated cS to encapsulated tS could be achieved readily due to the better stabilization of tS within the cavity of C1 and its transparency to visible light. A multi&#8208;functional system was therefore designed, which at the same time is stimuli&#8208;responsive, shows isomer selectivity, and photo&#8208;protects trans&#8208;stilbene.

         <title>Copper Atom Pairs Stabilize *OCCO Dipole Toward Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>

The copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (Cu2) catalyst featuring dual&#8208;Cu atomic pairs, which delivers a high FE of 51&#8201;% toward C2H4 and a current density of 450&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, markedly surpassing the performance of Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts and Cu nanoparticles. The results reveal that the unique Cu atom pairs in Cu2 regulate the adsorption energy of *CO to facilitate C&#8722;C dimerization and stabilize the *OCCO intermediate dipole to promote the C2H4 pathway.







Abstract
Deeply electrolytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high&#8208;value ethylene (C2H4) is very attractive. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling seriously results in the low selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to C2H4. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;based polyhedron (Cu2) that features uniformly distributed and atomically precise bi&#8208;Cu units, which can stabilize *OCCO dipole to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling for high selective C2H4 production. The C2H4 faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 51&#8201;% with a current density of 469.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, much superior to the Cu single site catalyst (Cu SAC) (~0&#8201;%). Moreover, the Cu2 catalyst has a higher turnover frequency (TOF, ~520&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to Cu nanoparticles (~9.42&#8197;h&#8722;1) and Cu SAC (~0.87&#8197;h&#8722;1). In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique Cu2 structural configuration could optimize the dipole moments and stabilize the *OCCO adsorbate to promote the generation of C2H4.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Disordered RuO2 Catalyst for Highly Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realizing an efficient and stable non&#8208;Iridium (Ir)&#8208;based acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for low&#8208;cost practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet a tremendous challenge due to the robust oxidation conditions and active species leaching. Long&#8208;range disordered Boron doped RuO2 catalysts demonstrate highly active and durable acidic OER (1200&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and achieve highly efficient (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.63&#8197;V) and stable (300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) operating in practical PEMWEs device.







Abstract
Non&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO2 by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO2 catalyst with long&#8208;range disorder (LD&#8208;B/RuO2). The structure of long&#8208;range disorder endowed LD&#8208;B/RuO2 with a low overpotential of 175&#8197;mV and an ultra&#8208;long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6&#8197;months at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 with almost invariable performance.

     alt="A Long-Range Disordered RuO2 Catalyst for Highly Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing an efficient and stable non-Iridium (Ir)-based acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for low-cost practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet a tremendous challenge due to the robust oxidation conditions and active species leaching. Long-range disordered Boron doped RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts demonstrate highly active and durable acidic OER (1200&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and achieve highly efficient (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.63&#8197;V) and stable (300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) operating in practical PEMWEs device.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-iridium acid-stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with long-range disorder (LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The structure of long-range disorder endowed LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a low overpotential of 175&#8197;mV and an ultra-long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6&#8197;months at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with almost invariable performance. More importantly, a PEM electrolyzer using LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the anode demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.63&#8197;V with durability exceeding 300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density. The introduction of B atoms induced the formation of a long-range disordered structure and symmetry-breaking B&#8722;Ru&#8722;O motifs, which enabled the catalyst structure to a certain toughness while simultaneously inducing the redistribution of electrons on the active center Ru, which jointly promoted and guaranteed the activity and long-term stability of LD-B/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study provides a strategy to prepare long-range disordered RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acidic OER catalysts with high stability using B-doping to perturb crystallinity, which opens potential possibilities for non-iridium-based PEMWE applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ostwald&#8208;Ripening Induced Interfacial Protection Layer Boosts 1,000,000&#8208;Cycled Hydronium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at addressing the issue of unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface caused by the lack of cathode electrolyte interphase in the cathode material of aqueous batteries, by reversing the notorious side reaction&#8212;dissolution of electrode materials, we applied Ostwald ripening in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, thus creating a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface, and leading to an excellent cycle life of one million cycles.







Abstract
Collapsing and degradation of active materials caused by the electrode/electrolyte interface instability in aqueous batteries are one of the main obstacles that mitigate the capacity. Herein by reversing the notorious side reactions include the loss and dissolution of electrode materials, as we applied Ostwald ripening (OR) in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in a hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, the dissolved Cu and Fe ions undergo a crystallization process that creates a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface. The layer exposed the low&#8208;index crystal planes (100) and (110) through OR&#8208;induced electrode particle growth, supplemented by vacancy&#8211;ordered (100) superlattices that facilitated ion migration. Our design stabilized the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface considerably, achieving a cycle life of one million cycles with capacity retention of 91.6&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 91.7&#8201;% after 3000&#8197;cycles for a full battery.

         <title>Cover Picture: Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonylation reactions introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) into a molecule to produce key chemicals including carboxylic acids, esters, and amides that are abundant in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and plastics. In their Research Article (e202410928), Robert S. Paton, Garret M. Miyake et al. developed a photocatalytic carbonylation strategy, which enables the conversion of alkyl halides to esters or amides under metal&#8208;free conditions. Additionally, this strategy allows for complete incorporation of the 13C isotope.

Ostwald ripening , as a well&#8208;known classic crystal growth mode, was introduced into the field of electrochemical energy storage by Wei Zhang, Weitao Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202414420). The transition metal ions dissolved in CuHCF undergo a crystallization process (Kongming lantern) and evolve into a stable interfacial layer (shining dome) via Ostwald ripening during electrochemical cycling. Through this process, the stability of the electrode and of the electrode/electrolyte interface are drastically improved.

         <title>Back Cover: Cascading Macrocycle and Helix Motions in a Foldarotaxane Molecular Shuttle (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50/2024)</title>

A foldarotaxane supramolecular machine is reported by Yann Ferrand, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202413977) Depending on pH and concentration, discrete isomers were obtained. The machine operates through gliding of the macrocycle that induces the gliding of the helix along the axle, or via the swapping of the relative position of macrocycle and helix by dissociation and reassociation of the supramolecule. In some cases, the helix sequestrates the macrocycle away from its best station.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Site&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Native Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Davis, Koh, and co&#8208;workers disclosed a method for transforming native sugars through homolytic cleavage of an isolatable S&#8208;glycoside, in notable &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 &#945;&#8201;:&#8201;&#946; stereoselectivity. The sugar is activated by 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (DMC) for the installation of an S&#8208;moiety that undergoes desulfurative C&#8722;C coupling using a combination of Hantzsch ester (HE) as reductant and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) under LED irradiation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates constitute the largest source of biomass on Earth, but their synthetic modification is challenging due to their high content in oxygen functionalities. The site&#8208; and stereoselective modification of native sugars is a definite goal of glycochemistry research. Recent efforts to bypass the need for protecting groups, leveraging selective activation through photochemical mechanisms for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;C bond formation from native sugars, are likely to largely impact all glycochemistry&#8208;related areas. Davis, Koh, and co&#8208;workers have recently presented their use of photocatalysis to develop a &#8220;cap and glycosylate&#8221; approach for the site&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation of native sugars. A modernized direct radical functionalization of in situ formed thioglycoside using photocatalysis was used in the synthetic manipulation of unprotected carbohydrates. This allowed reaching complex saccharides, and post&#8208;translational modification of proteins.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: From Catalytic Site Design to Microenvironment Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the advances in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for CO2 electroreduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation. Emphasis is placed on the structural and component advantages of MOFs. Additionally, the emerging applications toward practical electrocatalytic CO2 conversion scenarios, including diluted CO2 reduction, photo&#8208;assisted CO2 electroreduction, and C&#8722;N coupling, are also discussed.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;value carbon&#8208;based chemicals provides a sustainable approach to achieving an artificial carbon cycle. In the decade, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well&#8208;defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO2 reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO2 conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO2 reduction are further discussed.

         <title>Meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals with Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores how mechanochemistry can address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The potential of mechanochemistry to address climate change, energy scarcity, food insecurity and waste pollution by providing more efficient and environmentally friendly chemical processes is highlighted. Key advances and applications in sustainable chemistry are discussed.







Abstract
Chemistry traditionally relies on reactions in solution, but this method is increasingly problematic due to the scale of chemical processes and their economic and environmental impact. Handling residual chemical waste, including solvents, incurs significant costs and environmental pressure. Conversely, novel chemical approaches are needed to address pressing societal issues such as climate change, energy scarcity, food insecurity, and waste pollution. Mechanochemistry, a sustainable chemistry discipline that uses mechanical action to induce chemical reactivity without bulk solvents, is a hot topic in academic research on sustainable and green chemistry. Given its fundamentally different working principles from solution chemistry, mechanochemistry offers more efficient chemical processes and the opportunity to design new chemical reactions. Mechanochemistry has a profound impact on many urgent issues facing our society and it is now necessary to use mechanochemistry to address them. This Minireview aims to provide a guide for using mechanochemistry to meet the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby contributing to a prosperous society. Detailed analysis shows that mechanochemistry connects with most UN SDGs and offers more cost&#8208;efficiency than other approaches together with a superior environmental performance.

         <title>Dynamic Active Sites in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolutions of active sites are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis due to the applied potentials and reaction environments. The study on dynamic active sites deciphers the intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationships and provides more comprehensive insights into the interaction between electrocatalysts and electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
In&#8208;depth understanding of the real&#8208;time behaviors of active sites during electrocatalysis is essential for the advancement of sustainable energy conversion. Recently, the concept of dynamic active sites has been recognized as a potent approach for creating self&#8208;adaptive electrocatalysts that can address a variety of electrocatalytic reactions, outperforming traditional electrocatalysts with static active sites. Nonetheless, the comprehension of the underlying principles that guide the engineering of dynamic active sites is presently insufficient. In this review, we systematically analyze the fundamentals of dynamic active sites for electrocatalysis and consider important future directions for this emerging field. We reveal that dynamic behaviors and reversibility are two crucial factors that influence electrocatalytic performance. By reviewing recent advances in dynamic active sites, we conclude that implementing dynamic electrocatalysis through variable reaction environments, correlating the model of dynamic evolution with catalytic properties, and developing localized and ultrafast in situ/operando techniques are keys to designing high&#8208;performance dynamic electrocatalysts. This review paves the way to the development of the next&#8208;generation electrocatalyst and the universal theory for both dynamic and static active sites.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production with Key Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the coupling of photocatalytic hydrogen production with value&#8208;added oxidation reactions to enhance the efficiency and comprehensive value, encompassing overall water splitting, H2O2 synthesis, biomass conversion, alcohol oxidation, and pollutants treatment. It provides a comprehensive summary of advancements in the field and discusses future research prospects focusing on value, photocatalysts, and systems.







Abstract
Hydrogen represents a clean and sustainable energy source with wide applications in fuel cells and hydrogen energy storage systems. Photocatalytic strategies emerge as a green and promising solution for hydrogen production, which still reveals several critical challenges in enhancing the efficiency and stability and improving the whole value. This review systematically elaborates on various coupling approaches for photocatalytic hydrogen production, aiming to improve both efficiency and value through different oxidation half&#8208;reactions. Firstly, the fundamental mechanism is discussed for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Then, the advances, challenges, and opportunities are expanded for the coupling of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which focuses on the integration of value&#8208;added reactions including O2 production, H2O2 production, biomass conversion, alcohol oxidation, and pollutants treatment. Finally, the challenges and outlook of photocatalytic H2 production technology are analyzed from the aspects of coupling hydrogen production value, photocatalyst design and reaction system construction. This work presents a holistic view of the field, emphasizing the synergistic benefits of coupled reactions and their practical application potential, rather than focusing on catalysts or single reaction systems. This review provides valuable references for the development and application of photocatalytic hydrogen production in energy conversion and environmental conservation through sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly and economic pathways.

         <title>The Perils of Molecular Interpretations from Vibrational Spectra of Complex Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful molecular fingerprinting tool. Yet, interpreting IR spectra of molecularly complex media is challenging. Here, we examine the often&#8208;overlooked intricacies of spectral data analyses, revealing commonly misleading interpretations. Focusing on blood&#8208;based IR spectroscopy, we argue for a viewpoint shift to accept the technique's fingerprinting nature and provide suggestions to improve analytical practices.







Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy is a widely used technique for chemical characterizations across various analytical sciences. Its applications are increasingly extending to the analysis of complex samples such as biofluids, providing high&#8208;throughput molecular profiling. While powerful, the technique suffers from an inherent limitation: The overlap of absorption information across different spectral domains hinders the capacity to identify individual molecular substances contributing to measured signals. Despite the awareness of this challenge, the difficulty of analyzing multi&#8208;molecular spectra is often underestimated, leading to unsubstantiated molecular interpretations. Here, we examine the prevalent overreliance on spectral band assignment and illuminate the pitfalls of correlating spectral signals to discrete molecular entities or physiological states without rigorous validation. Focusing on blood&#8208;based infrared spectroscopy, we provide examples illustrating how peak overlap among different substances, relative substance concentrations, and preprocessing steps can lead to erroneous interpretations. We advocate for a viewpoint shift towards a more careful understanding of complex spectra, which shall lead to either accepting their fingerprinting nature and leveraging machine learning analysis &#8211; or involving additional measurement modalities for robust molecular interpretations. Aiming to help translate and improve analytical practices within the field, we highlight the limitations of molecular interpretations and feature their viable applications.

Gold selects silicon over boron in the light&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;coupling of B, Si&#8208;bifunctional olefins providing an easy way to unsymmetrically substituted 1,2&#8208;diaryl vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions with perfect chemo&#8208; and good stereoselectivity (Z/E 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The starting materials themselves are easily accessible by regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydroboration of trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted arylalkynes.







Abstract
The use of diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates, a class of chemical building blocks with well&#8208;known synthetic utility, is principally limited by the difficulty faced in their preparation. Herein, we present a convenient synthetic strategy based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed Hiyama arylation of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(borylvinyl)silanes, which are easily accessible by hydroboration of silylalkynes. By exploiting the highly electronegative nature of the gold(III) intermediate (which is accessed by light&#8208;assisted oxidation using aryl diazonium salts), a selective activation of the silyl group in the presence of the boron moiety is achieved. This opens a route to selectively synthesize diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad substrate range, excellent functional group tolerance, and perfect chemoselectivity. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction. The synthetic potential was demonstrated by downstream transformations providing a facile route to bifunctional phenanthrenes and triaryl&#8208;substituted olefins.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Peterson&#8208;Type Olefination Reactivity and its Use in a Silicon&#8208;Promoted Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of a silene and the C=O bond of a variety of carbonyl compounds produces four&#8208;membered silaoxetane heterocycles. These intermediates can be characterized, and engage in alkene&#8208;forming retro&#8208;cycloaddition reactions by the addition of SiO2. Moreover, the silene olefination reagent can be formed in&#8197;situ, giving rise to a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of adamantylsilene and the carbonyl group of aliphatic, aromatic or acetylenic ketones and aldehydes is demonstrated. The product of this reaction that is central to a non&#8208;ionic version of the Peterson olefination is an unusual four&#8208;membered 1,2&#8208;silaoxetane heterocycle that was characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. In the presence of SiO2, the silaoxetane undergoes retro&#8208;cycloaddition with the formation of alkene products. As the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds without the necessity of any base, enolizable ketones can be converted into olefins. In addition, it is shown that the adamantylsilene can be produced in&#8197;situ by a sila&#8208;Peterson reaction, providing valuable input for the development of a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Oxetanes Catalyzed by an Engineered Halohydrin Dehalogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective protein engineering of halohydrin dehalogenases was conducted to access both R and S enantiomers starting from racemic oxetanes or &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols. The variants display high stereoselectivity and activity for both the dehalogenation of &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols and ring opening of oxetanes through kinetic resolution, yielding a broad range of functional chiral oxetanes and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols.







Abstract
Although biocatalysis has garnered widespread attention in both industrial and academic realms, the enzymatic synthesis of chiral oxetanes remains an underdeveloped field. Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are industrially relevant enzymes that have been engineered to accomplish the reversible transformation of epoxides. In this study, a biocatalytic platform was constructed for the stereoselective kinetic resolution of chiral oxetanes and formation of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols. HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 was engineered to identify key variants capable of catalyzing the dehalogenation of &#947;&#8208;haloalcohols (via HheC M1&#8208;M3) and ring opening of oxetanes (via HheC M4&#8208;M5) to access both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configured products with high stereoselectivity and remarkable catalytic activity, yielding up to 49&#8201;% with enantioselectivities exceeding 99&#8201;% ee and E&gt;200. The current strategy is broadly applicable as demonstrated by expansion of the substrate scope to include up to 18 examples for dehalogenation and 16 examples for ring opening. Additionally, the functionalized products are versatile building blocks for pharmaceutical applications. To shed light on the molecular recognition mechanisms for the relevant variants, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed. The current strategy expands the scope of HHDH&#8208;catalyzed chiral oxetane ring construction, offering efficient access to both enantiomers of chiral oxetanes and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alcohols.

         <title>N&#8208;Halogenation by Vanadium&#8208;Dependent Haloperoxidases Enables 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vanadium&#8208;dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) class of enzymes are discovered as an effective biocatalyst platform for nitrogen&#8208;halogen (N&#8722;X) bond formation. VHPOs perform selective halogenation on a range of substituted benzamidine hydrochlorides to produce the corresponding N&#8217;&#8208;halobenzimidamides and this technology is applied to 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole synthesis.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds are valuable synthetic intermediates and targets in nearly every chemical industry. While methods for nitrogen&#8208;carbon and nitrogen&#8208;heteroatom bond formation have primarily relied on nucleophilic nitrogen atom reactivity, molecules containing nitrogen&#8208;halogen bonds allow for electrophilic or radical reactivity modes at the nitrogen center. Despite the growing synthetic utility of nitrogen&#8208;halogen bond&#8208;containing compounds, selective catalytic strategies for their synthesis are largely underexplored. We recently discovered that the vanadium&#8208;dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) class of enzymes are a suitable biocatalyst platform for nitrogen&#8208;halogen bond formation. Herein, we show that VHPOs perform selective halogenation of a range of substituted benzamidine hydrochlorides to produce the corresponding N&#8217;&#8208;halobenzimidamides. This biocatalytic platform is applied to the synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from the corresponding N&#8208;acylbenzamidines in high yield and with excellent chemoselectivity. Finally, the synthetic applicability of this biotechnology is demonstrated in an extension to nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen bond formation and the chemoenzymatic synthesis of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, ataluren.

         <title>Hydrogenolysis of Haloboranes: from Synthesis of Hydroboranes to Formal Hydroboration Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of hydroboranes is reported from dihydrogen (H2) and haloboranes, using a base to trap the released acid, under both stoichiometric and catalytic conditions. The system is applicable to one&#8208;pot hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.







Abstract
Hydroboranes are versatile reagents in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we report a new method for the preparation of hydroboranes from hydrogen and the corresponding haloboranes. Triethylamine (NEt3) form with dialkylchloroboranes a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H2 and afford the desired hydroborane with ammonium salts. Unreactive haloboranes were unlocked using a catalytic amount of Cy2BCl, enabling the synthesis of commonly used hydroboranes such as pinacolborane or catecholborane. The mechanisms of these reactions have been examined by DFT studies, highlighting the importance of the base selection. Finally, the system&#8216;s robustness has been evaluated in one&#8208;pot B&#8722;Cl hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.

&lt;p&gt;Hydroboranes are versatile reagents in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis relies on energy-intensive processes. Herein, we report a new method for the preparation of hydroboranes from hydrogen and the corresponding haloboranes. Triethylamine (NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form with dialkylchloroboranes a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and afford the desired hydroborane with ammonium salts. Unreactive haloboranes were unlocked using a catalytic amount of Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BCl, enabling the synthesis of commonly used hydroboranes such as pinacolborane or catecholborane. The mechanisms of these reactions have been examined by DFT studies, highlighting the importance of the base selection. Finally, the system&#8216;s robustness has been evaluated in one-pot B&#8722;Cl hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Strategy for the Formal C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling of Tertiary Amines</title>

We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of acyclic and cyclic tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. Applications to the late&#8208;stage modification of complex heterocycles are presented.







Abstract
We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of diverse tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the efficient generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. The protocol is applicable to acyclic and cyclic systems, including highly hindered variants. Applications to the late&#8208;stage modification of complex heterocycles are presented.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;stage Benzylic Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly site&#8208;selective acridinium/HAT catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions with simple and inexpensive D2O as an isotope source is reported. Unprecedented selective HIE on competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions was achieved with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation, enabling the effective late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives.







Abstract
A highly regioselective visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of benzylic positions in both simple and complex molecules is reported. The process follows a dual catalytic approach using an acridinium photocatalyst in combination with a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, while the use of D2O as an isotope source ensures operational simplicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. High reactivity has been achieved for electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions. Moreover, targeted radical formation enables unprecedented selective HIE on intramolecular competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation. The utility of the reaction was demonstrated on the late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a single electron transfer (SET) mechanism followed by deprotonation to generate the benzylic radical, and revealed the importance of halogenated solvents or additives. Upon a weak complexation of the halogenated species to the substrate, an oxidation potential lowering effect is induced, as well as a stabilization of the radical&#8208;cation species through spin delocalization.

         <title>Enhancement of Lithium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction by Modifying Center Atom of Tetraalkyl&#8208;Type Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcoholic proton carriers in lithium mediated nitrogen reduction were replaced with ionic liquids (ILs). Switching the central atom in these ILs notably boosted performance, increasing Faradaic efficiency (FE) by 1.45&#8197;times when switching from phosphonium to ammonium cations with an FE of 39.5&#8201;% and remained stable for over 12&#8197;h.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a viable alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia production. However, ethanol, a common proton carrier in Li&#8208;NRR, exhibits electrochemical instability, leading to oxidation at the anode or byproduct formation at the cathode. This study replaces alcoholic proton carriers with ionic liquids (ILs), specifically tetrabutylphosphonium chloride (TBPCl) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl), to examine how the electronegativity differences between the central atom and adjacent carbon of the cation affect catalytic performance. The results show that switching the central atom in tetraalkyl&#8208;type ILs markedly enhances performance, specifically resulting in a 1.45&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency (FE) with the transition from phosphonium to ammonium cation of ILs. Additionally, optimal IL concentrations in the electrolyte are identified to maximize ammonia yield. TBACl, in particular, demonstrates enhanced ammonia production and operational stability, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 13.60&#8197;nmol/cm2/s, an FE of 39.5&#8201;%, and operational stability for over 12&#8197;h under conditions of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 and 10&#8197;atm. This research underscores the potential of precise IL modifications for more efficient and sustainable Li&#8208;NRR.

         <title>Recognition and order of multiple sidechains by metal&#8211;organic framework enhances the separation of hexane isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordering of multiple sidechains on a metal&#8211;organic framework is achieved by the assembly of linkers that differ only in the appended functional groups at a chiral centre. The strain induced by the functional groups defines the conformation of each linker and drives their ordering in the crystal structure of the framework. The pore environments formed by this assembly have well&#8208;defined adsorption sites for hexane isomers and enhance their separation.







Abstract
Porous materials perform molecular sorting, separation and transformation by interaction between their framework structures and the substrates. Proteins also interact with molecules to effect chemical transformations, but rely on the precise sequence of the amino acid building units along a common polypeptide backbone to maximise their performance. Design strategies that positionally order sidechains over a defined porous framework to diversify the internal surface chemistry would enhance control of substrate processing. Here we show that different sidechains can be ordered over a metal&#8211;organic framework through recognition of their distinct chemistries during synthesis. The sidechains are recognised because each one forces the common building unit that defines the backbone of the framework into a different conformation in order to form the extended structure. The resulting sidechain ordering affords hexane isomer separation performance superior to that of the same framework decorated only with sidechains of a single kind. The separated molecules adopt distinct arrangements within the resulting modified pore geometry, reflecting their strongly differentiated environments precisely created by the ordered sidechains. The development of frameworks that recognize and order multiple sidechain functionality by conformational control offers tailoring of the internal surfaces within families of porous materials to direct interactions at the molecular level.

     alt="Recognition and order of multiple sidechains by metal&#8211;organic framework enhances the separation of hexane isomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ordering of multiple sidechains on a metal&#8211;organic framework is achieved by the assembly of linkers that differ only in the appended functional groups at a chiral centre. The strain induced by the functional groups defines the conformation of each linker and drives their ordering in the crystal structure of the framework. The pore environments formed by this assembly have well-defined adsorption sites for hexane isomers and enhance their separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous materials perform molecular sorting, separation and transformation by interaction between their framework structures and the substrates. Proteins also interact with molecules to effect chemical transformations, but rely on the precise sequence of the amino acid building units along a common polypeptide backbone to maximise their performance. Design strategies that positionally order sidechains over a defined porous framework to diversify the internal surface chemistry would enhance control of substrate processing. Here we show that different sidechains can be ordered over a metal&#8211;organic framework through recognition of their distinct chemistries during synthesis. The sidechains are recognised because each one forces the common building unit that defines the backbone of the framework into a different conformation in order to form the extended structure. The resulting sidechain ordering affords hexane isomer separation performance superior to that of the same framework decorated only with sidechains of a single kind. The separated molecules adopt distinct arrangements within the resulting modified pore geometry, reflecting their strongly differentiated environments precisely created by the ordered sidechains. The development of frameworks that recognize and order multiple sidechain functionality by conformational control offers tailoring of the internal surfaces within families of porous materials to direct interactions at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt Tetracationic 3,4&#8208;Pyridinoporphyrazine for Direct CO2 to Methanol Conversion Escaping the CO Intermediate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigate the electrocatalytic properties of tetracationic cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for CO2 reduction in a heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike previous reports on cobalt&#8208;based phthalocyanine electrocatalysis, which suggested CO as an intermediate in the reduction to methanol, our findings indicate that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol, thereby excluding a mechanistic pathway where CO is an intermediate.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.

         <title>Carbenoids with Sulfinate as Nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;Type Homologation: Direct Insertion of Oxygen&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Units into Carbon&#8208;Boron Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of carbenoid for Matteson&#8208;type homologation with sulfinate as the nucleofuge has been developed. This coupling partner allows the direct insertion of O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylene units into the C&#8722;B bonds of boronic acid derivatives under non&#8208;cryogenic conditions and in the absence of a strong base.







Abstract
Carbenoid insertion into boronate carbon&#8208;boron bonds, namely the Matteson&#8208;type homologation, has been recognized as a powerful tool for constructing carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. However, some limitations and inconvenience still exist with the carbenoids currently employed, such as the use of highly cryogenic and basic conditions. Herein, we report a new class of stable carbenoids with sulfinate as nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;type homologations, which directly introduce O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylenes into carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Enabled by oxazaborolidines as the boronic substrates, the reaction is operatable at 0&#8201;&#176;C or room temperature with weaker bases. Broad functional groups, including acidic C&#8722;H bonds, can be tolerated. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and iterative insertion of various carbenoids.

Direct Aminophosphonation: A new, metal&#8208;free method has been developed to simultaneously aminate and phosphonylate imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines using eco&#8208;friendly solvents in normal air. This process is simple, sustainable, scalable, and functional&#8208;group tolerant. The resulting compounds have light&#8208;emitting properties, making them promising for use as fluorescent probes (blue to greenish fluorescence).







Abstract
We report a novel, metal&#8208;free procedure for the direct aminophosphonation of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in green solvents under open air conditions. This method is characterized by its mild and sustainable conditions, ease of operation, scalability, and excellent functional group compatibility. The synthesized compounds exhibit promising photophysical properties, including significant Stokes shifts and quantum yields, making them potential candidates for innovative fluorescent probes.

         <title>Controlling the Redox Chemistry of Cobalt Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elementally matched 55Co (PET imaging)/58mCo (therapy) radioisotope pair is suitable for tandem diagnostic/therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Modulation of the Co2+/3+ redox couple is facile in mild oxidative conditions compatible with radiopharmaceutical synthesis, including radiolysis by the isotope's endogenous decay properties. Redox control at tracer scale provides access to the varied and unexplored functionality of 2+ and 3+ 55/58mCo complexes.







Abstract
The elementally matched 55Co2+/3+ (t1/2=17.53&#8197;h, I&#946;+=77&#8201;%)/58mCo2+/3+ (t1/2=9.10&#8197;h, internal conversion=100&#8201;%) radioisotope pair is of interest for development of paired diagnostic/therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Due to the accessibility of the nat/55Co2+/3+ redox couple, the redox state can be readily modulated. Here, we show that macroscopic and radiochemical redox reactions can be closely monitored and controlled using spectroscopic and radiochemical methods. We employ model systems to inform how to selectively synthesize thermodynamically favored oxidation state coordination complexes. In addition to exogenous oxidants, our data indicates that 55Co&#8208;induced radiolysis of water efficiently and directly drives selective oxidation to the 55Co3+ species under no&#8208;carrier added (n.c.a.) conditions. Our synthetic strategies subsequently stabilize the respective 55Co2+ or 55Co3+ species for targeted positron emission tomography imaging in a mouse tumor model.

         <title>Magnetically Induced Amination of Alcohols Using MNi@Cu (M=Fe, Co) Nanoparticles as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co4Ni6@Cu and Fe3Ni7@Cu nanoparticles containing a magnetic core and a catalytic shell have been synthesized and found to be highly active catalysts for amination of primary and secondary alcohols with secondary amines when an alternating magnetic field (AMF) is applied. Several tertiary amines have hence been prepared under argon without hydrogen feed. This process allows to limit degradation reactions of the reagents and of the products and can therefore be used for the synthesis of other thermally sensitive molecules.







Abstract
The synthesis of tertiary amines from alcohols (i.e. heptanol, dodecanol, cyclohexanol, benzylalcohol) and secondary amines (Me2NH (DMA), nPr2NH, nBu2NH) has been achieved in one step using trimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) displaying a magnetic core (Co4Ni6 and Fe3Ni7) and a Cu shell as both catalysts and heating agent in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. This methodology limits the redistribution reactions occurring on amines at high temperature leading to both much higher conversion and selectivity in the absence of solvent than usually observed using conventional heating. Moreover, Co4Ni6@Cu NPs were found moisture resistant, thereby allowing for performing the reaction with commercial DMA in water (40&#8201;%&#8201;wt) with again high conversion and selectivity.

         <title>Design of Stable Chiral Aminosulfonium Ylides and Their Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the stabilization effect of an adjacent N&#8208;atom and a cyclic sulfide moiety, conformationally stable acyclic S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylides were accessed for the first time with excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol via a copper catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular carbene transfer reaction. The resulting products allow for further stereospecific elaborations to afford aminosulfonium ylide oxides and sulfinamide.







Abstract
The isolation and catalytic enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable S&#8208;stereogenic sulfonium ylides have been significant challenges in the field of asymmetric synthesis. These reactive intermediates are crucial for a variety of synthetic transformations, yet their inherent tendency towards rapid inversion at the sulfur stereocenter has hindered their practical utilization. Conventional approaches have focused on strategies that incorporate a C=S bond&#8208;containing cyclic framework to help mitigate this stereochemical lability. In this work, we present an alternative tactic that leverages the stabilizing influence of an adjacent N&#8208;atom and cyclic sulfide moiety. Exploiting a copper catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular carbene transfer reaction, structurally diverse S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylides have been achieved in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Experimental results indicate that the careful selection of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketone precursors is crucial for achieving optimal stereoinduction in this transformation. The resulting highly enantioenriched aminosulfonium ylides allow for further stereospecific elaborations to furnish aminosulfonium ylide oxides and sulfinamide. This work expands the boundaries of chiral sulfonium ylide chemistry, providing access to a broad range of previously elusive S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylide scaffolds.

         <title>Improved Energy Transfer in the Sensitization of Americium Enables Observation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reported example of americium circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is presented. The synthesis of a molecular complex supported by 2&#8208;thenoylacetonate and BINAPO yielded a compound that displayed enhanced f&#8208;f luminescence thanks to a unique sensitization pathway. This allowed for the detection of CPL despite weak instrumental detection capabilities.







Abstract
The first example of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a molecular americium (Am) complex is reported. Coordination of Am(III) by a combination of thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and a chiral diphosphine oxide ligand yielded a complex with strong sensitized metal&#8208;centered luminescence. The energy transfer process for sensitization appears to occur via a unique resonant pathway, which results in the removal of the overlap between ligand phosphorescence and sensitized Am luminescence that has often been observed. Owing to this feature, and despite the limited amount of material that could be used due to the radioactivity of 241Am, CPL could be measured. The collected luminescence and CPL spectra provide insight into the crystal field splitting of the 5D1&#8594;7F1 transition. These results pave the way for future studies of Am(III) luminescence to investigate electronic structure effects in this and other 5&#8201;f elements.

         <title>In situ Monitoring of Photocatalysis on Polymeric Carbon Nitride Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes are developed for time&#8208;resolved monitoring of pCN photocatalyzed reaction processes under visible light conditions. This technique allows simultaneous in situ irradiation and monitoring of heterogeneous reactions, which enables the detection of intermediates that are elusive in conventional spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride has attracted significant interest in heterogeneous photocatalysis due to its activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, we report on using carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes for in situ studies of photocatalytic reaction mechanisms. In a first step, we exploited carbon nitride&#8208;coated crimp vials as batch photoreactors for visible photocatalytic fluorinations of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, with moderate to excellent yields and reusability over multiple cycles. Eventually, carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes were used as a photoreactor by coupling them with optical fiber irradiation directly inside the spectrometer. This enabled us to follow the reaction with in situ NMR spectroscopy identifying reactive intermediates otherwise elusive in conventional analyses. The method provides advantages for the study of photocatalytic mechanisms of complex reactions and substantially reduces the need of comparative tests for depicting reaction intermediates and conversion pathways.

         <title>The Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 100&#8197;years after Staudinger's seminal reports on the reaction of iminophosphoranes with aldehydes, an alternative path, the so&#8208;called &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction&#8221; has been uncovered. We describe the reaction of bulky azides with PMe3 in the presence of aromatic aldehydes to give triazabutadienes (TBDs). This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is a versatile route towards TBDs, tolerating various aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms into conjugated organic molecules is an important strategy to tune their reactivity and physical properties. In this realm triazabutadienes (TBDs) of the general from R2C=N&#8722;N=NR&#8217; are an interesting class of compounds, however, general synthetic protocols for their generation are limited. Based on the serendipitous finding that the sterically encumbered azide Mes*N3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2) reacted with PMe3 in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde to form a TBD, we now report on the &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig&#8221; reaction. This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is shown to be a versatile tool for the synthesis of a variety of TBDs, tolerating a wide range of aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners. The preference for azide&#8208;Wittig, rather than aza&#8208;Wittig reactivity was rationalized using computational methods. This study shows how kinetic control can significantly alter the reaction pathway, thereby switching from an aza&#8208;Wittig to an azide&#8208;Wittig regime.

This azide-Wittig reaction is shown to be a versatile tool for the synthesis of a variety of TBDs, tolerating a wide range of aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners. The preference for azide-Wittig, rather than aza-Wittig reactivity was rationalized using computational methods. This study shows how kinetic control can significantly alter the reaction pathway, thereby switching from an aza-Wittig to an azide-Wittig regime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Conditions for Intramolecular N&#8722;O Couplings via Rhodium Nitrenoids Generated from N&#8208;Acyl Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides under rhodium catalysis are presented. The solvent&#8208;free method proceeds via rhodium nitrenoids and produces unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in a short reaction time with up to 98&#8201;% yield. Potential synthetic applications of the resulting five&#8208;membered heterocycles as nitrene precursors are demonstrated by reacting a representative compound with DMSO under heat or blue light.







Abstract
Starting from N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides, mechanochemically generated rhodium nitrenoids undergo intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings to provide unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields. The cyclization proceeds efficiently with a catalyst loading of only 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% in the presence of phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) as oxidant. Neither an inert atmosphere nor additional heating is required in this solvent&#8208;free procedure. Under heat or blue light, the newly formed five&#8208;membered heterocycles function as nitrene precursors reacting with sulfoxides as exemplified by the imidation of dimethyl sulfoxide.

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangements in the Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Biosynthesis of Coral&#8208;Type Diterpenes from Chitinophaga pinensis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diterpene synthases were characterised from the bacterium Chitinophaga pinensis that catalyse the formation of typical coral&#8208;derived compounds including known palmatol and a new conformationally rigid eunicellane diterpene, posing interesting questions on the ecological functions in organisms evolutionary as distant as bacteria and corals. The complex enzyme mechanisms were interrogated in isotope labelling experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Two diterpene synthases from the bacterium Chitinophaga pinensis were characterised. The first enzyme mainly produced the rearranged diterpene palmatol, a compound known from octocorals, while the second enzyme made the new coral&#8208;type eunicellane chitinol. The mechanisms of both enzymes were deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations, and with a substrate analog containing a saturated double bond, resulting in the formation of derailment products that gave additional insights into the nature of the cyclisation cascade intermediates. The formation of coral&#8208;type diterpenes poses interesting questions on the functions of these compounds in organisms as different as bacteria and corals.

         <title>Cascading Macrocycle and Helix Motions in a Foldarotaxane Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A foldarotaxane molecular shuttle is reported that operates through orchestrated interdependent motions of the macrocycle and foldamer. Depending on the pH and concentration, stable and metastable states could be obtained. In particular, shuttling of the macrocycle triggered the gliding of the foldamer away from its best station. Conversely, the foldamer unit could compartmentalize the rotaxane axle and trap the macrocycle away from its best station.







Abstract
The design of a dynamically assembled foldarotaxane was envisioned with the aim of operating as a two cascading trigger&#8208;based molecular shuttle. Under acidic conditions, both the macrocycle and helix were localized around their respective best molecular stations because they are far enough from each other not to alter the stability of complexes. The pH&#8208;dependent localization of the macrocycle along the encircled axle allowed us to modulate the association between the helical foldamer and its sites of interaction on the axle. Under kinetic control&#8212;at low concentration and room temperature&#8212;when the foldarotaxane supramolecular architecture is kinetically stable, the pH&#8208;responsive translation of the macrocycle along the thread triggered the gliding of the helix away from its initial best station. At higher concentration&#8212;when helix assembly/disassembly process is accelerated&#8212;the system reached the equilibrium state. A new foldarotaxane isomer then appeared through the change of the relative position of the helix and macrocycle along the thread. In this isomer, the helix segregated the macrocycle away from its best station. The fine control of the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, combined with the control of pH, allowed the reciprocal segregation of the helix or the ring away from their respective best sites of interaction.

         <title>Nuclease&#8208;Resistant L&#8208;DNA Tension Probes Enable Long&#8208;Term Force Mapping of Single Cells and Cell Consortia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel class of DNA&#8208;based tension probes, L&#8208;DNA tension probes, based on the non&#8208;biological stereoisomer of D&#8208;DNA. These probes are exceptionally resistant to nuclease degradation and remarkably bioinert. Unlike conventional D&#8208;DNA probes, L&#8208;DNA probes can endure cell culture environments for several days, enabling long&#8208;term imaging of single cells as well as a group of cells.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based tension probes with precisely programmable force responses provide important insights into cellular mechanosensing. However, their degradability in cell culture limits their use for long&#8208;term imaging, for instance, when cells migrate, divide, and differentiate. This is a critical limitation for providing insights into mechanobiology for these longer&#8208;term processes. Here, we present DNA&#8208;based tension probes that are entirely designed based on the stereoisomer of biological D&#8208;DNA, i.e., L&#8208;DNA. We demonstrate that L&#8208;DNA tension probes are essentially indestructible by nucleases and provide days&#8208;long imaging without significant loss in image quality. We also show their superiority already for short imaging times commonly used for classical D&#8208;DNA tension probes. We showcase the potential of these resilient probes to image minute movements, and for generating long term force maps of single cells and of collectively migrating cell populations.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;Dicarbaldehydes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl addition of silicon nucleophiles released from the corresponding Si&#8722;B reagent enables the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehydes. The catalyst&#8208;controlled 1,2&#8208;addition is highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective, stopping at the stage of the monoaddition. A subsequent addition to the unreacted carbonyl group is substrate&#8208;controlled in the presence of an achiral ligand. The possible [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement is not seen in either step. The resulting products can be further converted into functionalized, axially chiral compounds.







Abstract
A desymmetrizing 1,2&#8208;addition of silicon nucleophiles to biaryl derivatives containing an 2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde&#8208;1&#8208;yl unit is reported.

     alt="Enantio- and Diastereoselective Desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;-Biaryl-2,6-Dicarbaldehydes by Copper-Catalyzed 1,2-Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed carbonyl addition of silicon nucleophiles released from the corresponding Si&#8722;B reagent enables the desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;-biaryl-2,6-dicarbaldehydes. The catalyst-controlled 1,2-addition is highly diastereo- and enantioselective, stopping at the stage of the monoaddition. A subsequent addition to the unreacted carbonyl group is substrate-controlled in the presence of an achiral ligand. The possible [1,2]-Brook rearrangement is not seen in either step. The resulting products can be further converted into functionalized, axially chiral compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A desymmetrizing 1,2-addition of silicon nucleophiles to biaryl derivatives containing an 2,6-dicarbaldehyde-1-yl unit is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by copper with a triazolium-ion-derived N-heterocyclic carbene as the chiral ligand and makes use of an Si&#8211;B reagent as the silicon pronucleophile. The practical methodology furnishes axially chiral aromatic carbaldehydes decorated with a centrally chiral &#945;-hydroxysilane moiety in moderate to good yields and with high enantio- as well as excellent diastereoselectivities. The silicon nucleophile always attacks at the diastereotopic face of either carbonyl group away from the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; substituent on the phenyl ring at C1 of the 2,6-dicarbaldehyde-1-yl fragment. The resulting axially and centrally chiral products can be further converted into valuable biaryl compounds with hardly any erosion of the enantiomeric excess.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homonuclear Super&#8208;Resolution NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectral resolution is a limiting factor in protein NMR for dynamics analysis and structure elucidation. With the Super Resolution method the peak line&#8208;width is reduced by a factor of 2&#8211;3. For the 20&#8197;kDa protein KRAS, highly resolved 2D NOESY spectra suitable for automated analysis can be acquired within less than 3&#8197;hours.







Abstract
In homonuclear 1H&#8197;NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra such as [1H,1H]&#8208;NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement spectroscopy), which is a historic cornerstone spectrum for biomolecular NMR structural biology, hundreds to thousands of cross peaks are present within a square of approximately 100&#8197;ppm2 leading to a lot of signal overlap. Spectral resolution is thus a limiting factor for unambiguous chemical shift assignment and data interpretation for dynamics and structure elucidation. Acquiring the spectra at higher magnetic fields such as at a 1.2&#8197;GHz 1H frequency helps to reduce spectral crowding, since resolution scales proportionally to the magnetic field strength. Here, we show that the linewidths of cross peaks in [1H,1H]&#8208;NOESY and [1H,1H]&#8208;TOCSY spectra can be further reduced by a factor of 2&#8211;3 in each dimension by super&#8208;resolution spectroscopy. In the indirect dimension a composite exponential&#8208;cosine weighted number of scans along the time increments are recorded and digitally smoothened by a window function, while in the direct dimension an exponential&#8208;cosine window function is applied. Furthermore, measurement time saving by reduced&#8208;acquisition super&#8208;resolution (RASR) is introduced. Application to the 20&#8197;kDa protein KRAS shows that highly resolved NMR spectra suitable for automated analysis can be acquired within less than 3&#8197;hours. The method opens an avenue towards automated chemical shift assignment, dynamics and structure determination of unlabeled small and medium size proteins within 24&#8197;hours.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Depolymerization of Functionalized Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;enzymatic concept is described for the depolymerization of low molecular weight polyethylene. Initial treatment with mCPBA and ultrasonication is followed by the key steps, a four&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction yielding various functionalized medium&#8208;chain products.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most commonly used plastic type in the world, contributing significantly to the plastic waste crisis. Microbial degradation of PE in natural environments is unlikely due to its inert saturated carbon&#8208;carbon backbones, which are difficult to break down by enzymes, challenging the development of a biocatalytic recycling method for PE waste. Here, we demonstrated the depolymerization of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) PE using an enzyme cascade that included a catalase&#8208;peroxidase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, a Baeyer Villiger monooxygenase, and a lipase after the polymer was chemically pretreated with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) and ultrasonication. In a preparative experiment with gram&#8208;scale pretreated polymers, GC&#8208;MS and weight loss determinations confirmed ~27&#8201;% polymer conversion including the formation of medium&#8208;size functionalized molecules such as &#969;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids and &#945;,&#969;&#8208;carboxylic acids. Additional analyses of LMWPE&#8208;nanoparticles using AFM showed that enzymatic depolymerization reduced the sizes of these mCPBA&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;treated LMWPE&#8208;nanoparticles. This multi&#8208;enzyme catalytic concept with distinct chemical steps represents a unique starting point for future development of bio&#8208;based recycling methods for polyolefin waste.

         <title>Enamine Synthesis via Regiocontrolled 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Tethered Carboamination of Propargylic Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
The regiocontrolled synthesis of enamines was achieved by the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carboamination of propargylic alcohols using molecular aldimine tethers. 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo cyclic trisubstituted enamines were selectively prepared based on the choice of the amine protecting group. The obtained enamines were easily transformed in 2,1&#8208; and 3,1&#8208;amino alcohols and their fluorinated derivatives.







Abstract
Enamines are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Nevertheless, only a limited number of strategies have been reported for preparing trisubstituted enamines in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. Herein, we report a regiocontrolled 6&#8208;endo and 5&#8208;exo tethered carboamination of propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of trisubstituted enamines. High regioselectivity was achieved through fine&#8208;tuning of the amine protecting group during the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carboamination. The introduced trifluoromethylated tether enables further stereoselective functionalizations, such as hydrogenation and fluorination.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Enhanced by a Non&#8208;Emissive Dual Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722; complex enhances the ECL detection system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) by up to an order of magnitude without interference from the inherent ECL of previously reported Ir(III) enhancers. In addition to its electrocatalysis of TPrA oxidation and efficient chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminophore, the complex increases the thickness of the ECL layer by extending diffusion of the intermediates from the electrode.







Abstract
A sulfonated tris(1&#8208;phenylpyrazolato)iridium(III) complex ([Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722;) serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept non&#8208;emissive enhancer of the widely used ECL detection system of tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)3]2+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) co&#8208;reactant, acting through electrocatalysis of TPrA oxidation and efficient chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminophore. Using self&#8208;interference ECL spectroscopy, we show that the enhancer extends diffusion of the required electrogenerated precursors from the electrode surface. Previously reported enhancement through these pathways has been confounded by the inherent ECL of the enhancer, but the increase in [Ru(bpy)3]2+ ECL intensity using [Ir(sppz)3]3&#8722; was obtained without its concomitant emission. The most prominent enhancement (11&#8208;fold) occurred at low potentials associated with the &#8216;indirect&#8217; co&#8208;reactant ECL pathway, which translated to between 2&#8208; and 6&#8208;fold enhancement when the luminophore was immobilised on microbeads as a general model for enhanced ECL assays.

Previously reported enhancement through these pathways has been confounded by the inherent ECL of the enhancer, but the increase in [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ECL intensity using [Ir(sppz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was obtained without its concomitant emission. The most prominent enhancement (11-fold) occurred at low potentials associated with the &#8216;indirect&#8217; co-reactant ECL pathway, which translated to between 2- and 6-fold enhancement when the luminophore was immobilised on microbeads as a general model for enhanced ECL assays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Six&#8208;Membered Ring Directed Assembly of a Zirconium Zeolitic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 50, December 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new paradigm for zirconium zeolite&#8208;type frameworks through the conversion of extraframework sites in natural zeolite into part of the framework by symmetry&#8208; and size&#8208;matched ring&#8208;directing agent for the size&#8208;exclusion separation of hexane isomers.







Abstract
The synthesis of zirconium MOFs with zeolite net is quite challenging due to the high connectivity of Zr6 clusters, which is far from tetrahedral connection, a requisite for zeolite net. In this work, we demonstrate a six&#8208;membered ring (6MR) strategy through mimicking of mineral zeolites with mixed ditopic and tritopic carboxylate linkers. With this strategy, the ditopic linker cross&#8208;links Zr6 clusters to form 4&#8208;connected zeolite&#8208;like nets, while the tritopic one is used to direct the formation of 6MR and simultaneously consumes extra coordination sites on the cluster. The feasibility of this strategy is shown by one zeolitic metal&#8211;organic framework (NNM&#8208;5) and this strategy has also led to the synthesis of the other dia&#8208;type zirconium MOF (NNM&#8208;6). Interestingly, as the tritopic linker not only directs the formation of 6MR but also partitions 6MR into small segments, NNM&#8208;5 with SOD topology shows a structural feature of small aperture and big cage, which has led to efficient separation of hexane isomers. With both exceptionally high n&#8208;hexane uptake (65.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and size&#8208;exclusion selectivity, an exceptional separation capability is verified by breakthrough experiments. Calculation results demonstrate that the large difference of diffusion energy barrier due to the small aperture accounts for the underlying separation mechanism.

         <title>Weakly Solvating Cyclic Ether&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolytes for Stable High&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEE) have emerged as an innovative approach to address the instability and safety issues of lithium metal batteries at elevated temperatures. However, in practice, there is often an undesirable incompatibility between the eutectic mixture and electrodes, and also an insufficient reduction stability of DEE due to the increased Li+ concentration. Herein, we designed a new DEE by utilizing weakly solvating tetrahydropyran (THP) solvent. Due to the high reduction resistance of THP and concentrated lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), this DEE demonstrates enhanced compatibility with Li metal anode and high temperature tolerance with LiMn2O4 cathode. The Li||LiMn2O4 cell (1.6 mAh cm&#8722;2) shows a high capacity retention of 96.02% after 600 cycles at room temperature. More importantly, this Li||LiMn2O4 cell achieves a remarkable high&#8208;temperature performance with a high capacity retention of 91.72% after 120 cycles and low self&#8208;discharge after storage for 240 hours at a high temperature of 55 &#176;C, which is critical for LiMn2O4 cathode. Overall, this electrolyte design provides an alternative pathway for the development of DEEs for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries, which can also be expanded to other batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Methylthio Substituent in SAM Constructing Regulatory Bridge with Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced remarkable advancements in recent years, which is largely attributed to the development of novel hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) materials. Methoxy (MeO&#8208;) groups are typically introduced into SAM materials to enhance their wettability and effectively passivate the perovskite buried interface. However, MeO&#8208;based SAM materials exhibit a mismatch in highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels with perovskite layer due to the strong electron&#8208;donating capability of methoxy group. In this work, we introduced a methylthio (MeS&#8208;) substituent that is superior to methoxy as a highly versatile self&#8208;assembled molecular design strategy. As a soft base, sulfur atom forms a stronger Pb&#8208;S bond than oxygen. Additionally, within the CbzPh series of SAM materials, MeS&#8208;CbzPh demonstrates a more optimal HOMO level and enhanced hole transport properties. Consequently, the MeS&#8208;CbzPh HTL based device achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01% and demonstrated high stability, retaining 93.3% efficiency after 1000 hours of maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Moreover, in comparison with the commonly used 4PACz&#8208;based SAM molecular series, MeS&#8208;4PACz also exhibited the best performance among its peers. Our work provides valuable insights for the molecular design of SAM materials, offering a highly versatile functional substituent group.</dc:description>

Compared with real catalysts, which are usually bulk or particle, 2D materials have more well&#8208;defined structures. With easily identified structure&#8208;modulated engineering, 2D materials become ideal models to figure out the catalytic structure&#8208;function relations, which is helpful for the precise design of catalyst. In this review, the unique function of 2D materials was summarized from model study to reality catalysis and application. It includes several typical 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, metal and metal (hydr)oxide materials. We introduced the structural characteristics of 2D materials and their advantages in model researches. It is emphatically summarized how 2D materials serve as models to explore the structure&#8208;activity relationship by combining theoretical calculations and surface researches. The opportunities of 2D materials and the challenges for fundamentals and applications they facing are also addressed. This review provides a reference for the design of catalyst structure and composition, and could inspire the realization of two&#8208;dimensional materials from model study to reality application in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Supramolecular Coordination Assemblies Visually Monitored by Time&#8208;Dependent Multicolor Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular coordination assemblies play an important role in both material science and biological systems. Despite significant efforts in their development, most existing examples are thermodynamically controlled, which lack the adaptability and autonomy essential for the creation of advanced materials. In this work, we have developed non&#8208;equilibrium coordination assembly systems that can evolve over time through a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic controls. The introduction of zinc ions resulted in the formation of metastable fiber assemblies in a kinetically trapped state, which autonomously converted to thermodynamically stable nanosheets over time. This evolution process can be regulated by external stimuli and visually monitored by the time&#8208;dependent multicolor fluorescence. The construction strategy was versatile across other various ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+, offering inspiring insights for the design of complex systems that operated both in and out of their thermodynamic equilibrium</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Key Post&#8208;modification Enzymes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Lanostane&#8208;type Triterpenoids in the Medicinal Mushroom Antrodia camphorata</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanostane&#8208;type triterpenoids are important bioactive secondary metabolites of mushrooms, though their biosynthetic study has been challenging due to scattered genes. Herein, the strategies of combining metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, functional motif blast, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotation were used to discover three key post&#8208;modification enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lanostanoids in the medicinal mushroom Antrodia camphorata. The cytochrome P450 enzyme AcCYP4 could generate a &#916;7,9(11) diene structure and introduce a 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxy group to the triterpene skeleton. The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase AcSDR6 could regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of 3&#946;&#8208;OH to produce 3&#8208;keto triterpenoids, and the catalytic mechanisms were interpreted by crystal structure analysis. AcSMT1 could introduce the methyl group at C&#8208;24 to produce a unique 31&#8208;carbon triterpene skeleton. This work elucidated the major biosynthetic pathway of Antrodia lanostanoids in vitro, and the discovered enzymes could be used to synthesize a series of bioactive triterpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;hydrogen gas hybrid batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global clean energy transition and carbon neutrality call for developing high&#8208;performance new batteries. Here we report a rechargeable lithium metal &#8208; catalytic hydrogen gas (Li&#8208;H) hybrid battery utilizing two of the lightest elements, Li and H. The Li&#8208;H battery operates through redox of H2/H+ on the cathode and Li/Li+ on the anode. The universal properties of the H2 cathode enable the battery to demonstrate attractive electrochemical performance, including high theoretical specific energy up to 2632 Wh kg&#8208;1, discharge voltage of 3 V, round&#8208;trip efficiency of 99.7%, reversible areal capacity of 5~20&#8201;mAh&#8201;cm&#8208;2, all&#8208;climate characteristics with a wide operational temperature range of &#8208;20 ~ 80 &#176;C, and high utilization of active materials. A rechargeable anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;H battery is further constructed by plating Li metal from cost&#8208;effective lithium salts under a low catalyst loading of &lt; 0.1 mg cm&#8208;2. This work presents a route to design batteries based on catalytic hydrogen gas cathode for high&#8208;performance energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioregular Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane): A Strictly Alternating BN&#8208;Isostere of Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of BN units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic com&#173;pounds, as substitutes for specific CC couples, often leads to new hybrid materials with modified physical and chemical properties. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane)s are derived from well&#8208;known poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by replacement of the vinylene groups by B=N linking units. Herein, an unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene imino&#173;borane) is presented that features a strictly alternating sequence of BN units along the main chain. The synthesis thereof was achieved by AB&#8208;type polymerization of a monomer featuring an N and a B ter&#173;minus. Monodisperse oligomers with up to three BN units in the chain were additionally prepared and structurally characterized. Associated with the introduction of a dipole in the regioregular backbone struc&#173;ture, they display notable fluorescence already in solution and large Stokes shifts, distinct from their previously reported BBNN&#8208;sequenced congeners. All compounds show aggregation&#8208;induced emission en&#173;hancement (AIEE) properties. Computational studies provided evi&#173;dence for emission from either locally excited (LE) or twisted intramo&#173;lecular charge transfer (TICT) states. These processes can be option&#173;ally addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to dual emission, solvato&#173;chromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking electrolytes for fast lithium&#8208;ion conduction and solid&#8208;state battery applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries paired with lithium (Li) metal anodes are considered to be promising high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive Li metal and the formation of Li dendrites during battery operation would cause safety concerns, especially with the employment of highly flammable liquid electrolytes. Herein, a general strategy by engineering coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks is proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance solid polymer electrolytes. Through the coordination of metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with cellulose&#8208;based copolymers, the Li+&#8208;conducted hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP&#8208;Li) polymer network is capable of enabling the rapid transport of Li+. In addition to the high Li+ conductivity (1.02&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also exhibits a high Li+ transference number (0.75) and a wide electrochemical stability window. Benefiting from the thermally stable and mechanically strong CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte film, the short&#8208;circuiting of the symmetric batteries is prevented even after 3200 h of cycling and a high specific energy of 300 Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved for the Li&#8211;metal battery. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;air batteries fabricated with CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also show good cycling performance (500 cycles) and high discharge capacity (15740 mAh g&#8722;1). The proposed coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking strategies offer an alternative route to design high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation sustainable battery chemistries.</dc:description>

         <title>An Advanced 3D Crosslinked Conductive Binder for Silicon Anodes: Leveraging Glycerol Chemistry for Superior Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) anodes hold great promise for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet their practical application is hindered by severe volume expansion and mechanical degradation. To tackle these challenges, we present an innovative 3D crosslinked conductive polyoxadiazole (POD) binder engineered with glycerol (GL) to form a robust network of covalent and hydrogen bonds. This unique chemical architecture not only enhances adhesion and mechanical resilience to effectively dissipate the stresses induced by Si&#8217;s volumetric changes but also constructs a robust conductive framework to facilitate electron transfer. The dynamic interplay between strong covalent and flexible hydrogen bonds in the POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL binder enables superior structural integrity and stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling. The Si@POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL anode exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, including a high initial Coulombic efficiency, impressive rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability, with an extremely low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.022% per cycle for 1000 cycles. This work highlights the potential of harnessing in&#8208;situ crosslinking chemistry to develop advanced binders, paving the way for the next generation of high&#8208;performance silicon anodes in LIBs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Silicon (Si) anodes hold great promise for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), yet their practical application is hindered by severe volume expansion and mechanical degradation.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Benzo&#8208;Phenoselenazine Derivatives for Multi&#8208;Subcellular Biomolecule Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating the subcellular localization of RNAs and proteins is fundamental to understanding their biological functions. Genetically encoded proteins/enzymes provide an attractive approach to target many proteins of interest, but are limited to specific cell lines. Although small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based methods have been explored, a comprehensive system for profiling multiple locations in living cells, comparable to fusion&#8208;protein techniques, is yet to be established. In this study, we introduce a novel proximity labeling strategy employing a suite of small molecules derived from benzophenoselenazine (e.g., selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue [SeNB]), which achieves proximity labeling through singlet oxygen generation upon near&#8208;infrared light activation in the presence of propargylamine. These SeNB compounds allow for&#160;selective labeling of RNAs and proteins within living cells, exhibiting a distinct preference for organelle membranes, which are systematically investigated via in vitro, computational, and in cellulo examinations. Our findings highlight the capabilities of SeNB derivatives as wash&#8208;free and genetics&#8208;free approaches to illuminate the subcellular localization of biological molecules with deep penetration and high spatial resolution. Moreover, SeNB derivatives are capable of elucidating inter&#8208;organelle interactions at the molecular level, as evidenced by proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, thus holding significant potential for advancing our understanding of cellular processes related to disease progression and therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Characterization and Molecular Basis of a Multi&#8208;site Halogenase in Naphthacemycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogenases are spurring a growing interest in the fields of biosynthesis and biocatalysis. Despite various halogenases have been identified in numerous natural product biosynthetic pathways, the mechanisms for multiple halogenations and site&#8208;selectivity remain largely unclear. In this study, we biochemically characterize FasV, a FAD&#8208;dependent halogenase (FDH) that catalyzes five successive chlorinations in the biosynthesis of naphthacene&#8208;containing aromatic polyketide naphthacemycin. This multiple halogenation reaction is elucidated occurring in an orderly fashion, as evidenced by enzyme kinetics, time&#8208;course assays, and computational simulations. Crystallographic analyses and mutagenesis studies reveal previously unrecognized amino acid residues, including T53, L81, F93, and I212, that are crucial for controlling regioselectivity and substrate specificity. Based on this, a I212T mutant is generated to exclusively catalyze selective monohalogenation. We propose a novel dual&#8208;activation mechanism, and demonstrate that FasV&#8217;s larger binding pocket makes it a valuable biocatalyst for other substrate with diverse structure. Therefore, this study provides new insights into multi&#8208;site polyhalogenases and highlights the potential for engineering FasV&#8208;like FDHs for biocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Azopyridine Polymers in Organic Phase Change Materials for High Energy Density Photothermal Storage and Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer (3&#8208;PAZOPY with an unprecedented untra&#8208;high energy density of 430&#8197;J/g forms a stable uniform two&#8208;phase hybrid composite system with the organic phase change material octanoic acid (OA) through a combination of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This system, serving as a noval solar photothermal fuels (STFs), is capable of simultaneously storing both photochemical and phase change energy, which holds significant potential for applications in household consumers energy distribution and utilization systems, as well as in photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategies.







Abstract
Azo&#8208;compounds molecules and phase change materials offer potential applications for sustainable energy systems through the storage and controllable release photochemical and phase change energy. Developing novel and highly efficient Azo&#8208;based solar thermal fuels (STFs) for photothermal energy storage and synergistic cooperation with organic phase change materials present significant challenges. Herein, three types of (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) azopyridine polymers hinged with flexible alkyl chain are synthesized, in which meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer exhibits striking photothermal storage capacity of 430&#8197;J/g, providing a feasibility solution for developing high energy density Azo&#8208;based STFs. Furthermore, a stable two&#8208;phase hybrid system was innovatively constructed by combining the meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer with organic phase change materials leveraging hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to collectively harness phase change energy and photothermal energy. The organic phase change material not only supplies additional phase change latent heat but also serves as a solvent, offering abundant free volume for the photo&#8208;induced isomerization of the azopyridine chromophores, which successfully circumvents the low charging efficiency in the condensed state and reliance on solvent&#8208;assisted charging in traditional Azo&#8208;based STFs. This study demonstrates the energy distribution and utilization for household consumers and the photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategy, achieving more extensive potential implementation for STFs.

         <title>Polymeric Iodine Transport Layer Enabled High Areal Capacity Dual Plating Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine battery is limited by the low conductivity of iodine. In this work, a polymeric conductive PVA hydrogel cathode was proposed. The unique &#8220;confined transport&#8221; of iodide/polyiodides ions in the hydrogel can effectively enhance the areal capacity with suppressed polyiodide shuttle effect.







Abstract
Iodine cathode in aqueous battery has drawn great attention due to its high energy density and high safety. However, iodine has extremely low conductivity of 1&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which usually results in low specific capacity. In this work, a PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer was designed to enhance the areal capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine cell. The areal capacity of PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer modified CNT cathode showed twice as higher capacity than that of pure CNT film in a dual&#8208;plating cell, The significant enhancement of the capacity was attributed to the fast iodine transport in the PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer. Besides, the strong interaction between PVA chain and polyiodide anions prevented the shuttle effect. The PVA modified CNT cathode could stably operate for over 3000&#8197;hours with remarkably higher capacity and cycle life. We analyzed the uniquely fast transport behavior of polyiodides in PVA hydrogel by in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical micrography, as well as DFT calculations. It was found that the strong binding force together with lower dissociation energy of iodine on PVA chain is the dominate reason for reduced shuttle effect and fast polyiodide transport. As a result, the assembled PVA&#8208;I2 pouch cells showed excellent performance in both dual&#8208;plating cells and conventional&#8208;type cells.

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Controlled Dynamic DNA Assembly Enables Temporally&#8208;Selective Orthogonal Regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING Stimulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy is designed to achieve on&#8208;demand orthogonally controlled stimulation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. The approach utilizes an engineered DNA motif with an enzymatically responsive moiety and a photocleavable linker into DNA motif, enabling enzyme&#8208;mediated activation and light&#8208;triggered termination of cGAS stimulation through dynamic DNA assembly.







Abstract
Despite advances in the controlled reconfiguration of DNA structures for biological applications, the dearth of strategies that allow for orthogonal regulation of immune pathways remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time an endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy that enables orthogonally controlled stimulation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A DNA motif containing two palindromic sequences is engineered with an abasic site (AP)&#8208;connected blocking sequence to inhibit its self&#8208;assembly function, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;triggered enzymatic cleavage of the AP site enables the reconfiguration and self&#8208;assembly of DNA motif into long double&#8208;stranded structures, thus realizing allosteric activation of the catalytic activity of cGAS to produce 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP for STING stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that APE1&#8208;regulated DNA assembly allows for cell&#8208;selective activation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. Furthermore, by re&#8208;engineering the DNA motif with a photocleavable group, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation to operate (switched &#8220;ON&#8221;), whereas light&#8208;mediated fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation (switched &#8220;OFF&#8221;), thereby achieving orthogonal control over immune regulation. This work highlights an endogenous and exogenous tandem regulated strategy to modulate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway in an orthogonally controlled manner.

     alt="Tandem-Controlled Dynamic DNA Assembly Enables Temporally-Selective Orthogonal Regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING Stimulation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An endogenous and exogenous tandem-regulated DNA assembly strategy is designed to achieve on-demand orthogonally controlled stimulation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. The approach utilizes an engineered DNA motif with an enzymatically responsive moiety and a photocleavable linker into DNA motif, enabling enzyme-mediated activation and light-triggered termination of cGAS stimulation through dynamic DNA assembly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite advances in the controlled reconfiguration of DNA structures for biological applications, the dearth of strategies that allow for orthogonal regulation of immune pathways remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time an endogenous and exogenous tandem-regulated DNA assembly strategy that enables orthogonally controlled stimulation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A DNA motif containing two palindromic sequences is engineered with an abasic site (AP)-connected blocking sequence to inhibit its self-assembly function, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)-triggered enzymatic cleavage of the AP site enables the reconfiguration and self-assembly of DNA motif into long double-stranded structures, thus realizing allosteric activation of the catalytic activity of cGAS to produce 2&#8217;3&#8217;-cyclic-GMP-AMP for STING stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that APE1-regulated DNA assembly allows for cell-selective activation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. Furthermore, by re-engineering the DNA motif with a photocleavable group, enzyme-triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation to operate (switched &#8220;ON&#8221;), whereas light-mediated fragmentation of the double-stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation (switched &#8220;OFF&#8221;), thereby achieving orthogonal control over immune regulation. This work highlights an endogenous and exogenous tandem regulated strategy to modulate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway in an orthogonally controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activating Oxygen via the 3&#8208;Electron Pathway to Hydroxyl Radical by La&#8722;O4 Single&#8208;atom on WO3 for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3&#8197;e&#8722; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8722;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8722;WOv) is achieved. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8722;WOv with 0.077&#8197;min&#8722;1 of rate constant. This work builds a catalyst for manipulating oxygen activation towards water purification as a representative application.







Abstract
Shifting photocatalytic oxygen activation towards 3&#8208;electron (e&#8722;) pathway to hydroxyl radicals, instead of the normal 1&#8197;e&#8722; to superoxide radicals, becomes increasingly important for pollution degradation since hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential (2.80&#8197;V). Here, we demonstrate a selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3&#8197;e&#8722; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8722;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8722;WOv). Unsaturated&#8208;state La overcomes the rate&#8208;limited step of 2&#8197;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1&#8197;e&#8722;. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1&#8197;e&#8722; to 3&#8197;e&#8722;. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4&#8722;WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 35 and 8&#8197;times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8722;WOv with 0.077&#8197;min&#8722;1 of rate constant, 38&#8197;times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98&#8201;% following five repeats, revealing a practical&#8208;utilization&#8208;level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated&#8208;state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.

         <title>Global Profiling Lysine Reactivity and Ligandability with Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidant&#8208;induced bioconjugation method has been developed for studying small molecule&#8208;lysine interactions. Various advantages have been demonstrated including real&#8208;time controllable labeling, excellent amino acid selectivity and labeling efficiency, in&#8208;depth lysine profiling capability and high stability. A suite of new ligandable lysines have been characterized, thus offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues.







Abstract
Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000&#8197;covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100&#8197;endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome. Moreover, we identified a suite of new ligandable lysines such as K60 of ENO1 and K31 of PPIA, offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues. These findings could provide valuable clues for the development of targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs).

         <title>Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Electrolyte with High Transference Number and Fast Conduction of Li Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of hypercrosslinked MOP (HCMOP) solid&#8208;state electrolyte was prepared using cationic MOPs, PEI macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units. Owing to the three&#8208;component synergistic effect, Li&#8208;HCMOP has excellent mechanical strength and can realize a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. This work highlights an effective idea of high&#8208;performance MOP&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes applied in LMBs.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high Li&#8208;ion transference numbers and fast ionic conductivity are urgently needed for technological innovations in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To promote the dissociation of ion pairs and overcome the mechanical brittleness and interface defects caused by traditional fillers in polymeric electrolytes, we designed and fabricated a cationic hypercrosslinking metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (HCMOPs) polymer as SSE. Benefiting a three&#8208;component synergistic effect: cationic MOPs, branched polyethyleneimine macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units, the Li&#8208;HCMOP electrolyte possesses a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. The LiFePO4/Li battery exhibits high capacity with superior rate performance and cycling stability. Moreover, soluble MOPs serve as high crosslinking nodes to provide excellent mechanical strength for electrolytes and good compatibility with polymers. This work highlights an effective idea of high&#8208;performance MOP&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes applied in LMBs.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) complexes with PNP pincer ligands have been isolated. They react with C&#8722;H bonds of unactivated substrates such as ethylene and benzene, leading to the oxidative C&#8722;H addition products. Depending on the size of the alkyl groups on the phosphorus atom, the reactivity towards C&#8722;H bonds can be fine&#8208;tuned.







Abstract
Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b, &#8220;framed&#8221; and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium complex 2&#8201;a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8722; Rh(I) complex 2&#8201;aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2&#8201;b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8722;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2&#8201;a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4&#8201;a) or C&#8722;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4&#8201;b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2&#8201;b was found to reversibly C&#8722;H activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.

Depending on the solvent, complex &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; reacted with ethylene either by &#960;-coordination (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) or C&#8722;H activation giving a hydrido-vinyl Rh(III) species &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; was found to reversibly C&#8722;H activate arenes to form the hydrido-aryl Rh(III) complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skeletal Nitrogen Functionalization of Isostructural 2D Conjugated MOFs for Enhancement of the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal nitrogen introduction strategy has been developed to fine&#8208;tune the dual&#8208;ion storage properties of isostructural 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs). The faradaic charge storage in isostructural MOFs can be improved by introducing additional aromatic nitrogen sites which synergistically act as cation adsorption sites and favor anion&#8208;adsorption to the metal sites energetically.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a viable path to realize superior dual&#8208;ion storage in 2D c&#8208;MOFs has remained elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of Cu2(Nx&#8722;OHPTP) 2D c&#8208;MOFs (x=0,1,2; OHPTP=octahydroxyphenanthrotriphenylene) with precise aromatic carbon&#8208;nitrogen arrangements, based on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated OHPTP ligand incorporated with one or two nitrogen atoms. The skeletal nitrogen modification in Cu2(Nx&#8722;OHPTP) allows the synergistic introduction of additional redox sites, and thus substantially favors the unique dual&#8208;ion adsorption capacity. Consequently, the Cu2(N2&#8722;OHPTP) cathode exhibits a largely enhanced electrochemical performance for dual&#8208;ion storage (i.e., Li+ and Cl&#8208;) with a high specific capacity of 53.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Cu2(N0&#8722;OHPTP) and 1.3&#8197;times that of Cu2(N1&#8722;OHPTP). Furthermore, the Cu2(N2&#8722;OHPTP) electrode displays a favorable rate performance of 52&#8201;% and good cycling stability of 96&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. We identify N&#8208;centered redox sites as additional Li+ adsorption sites by combining ex situ and in situ spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. In addition, calculations underline the synergistic enhancement of the Cl&#8722; adsorption energy by about 1.0&#8197;eV at the more electron&#8208;poor CuO4 linkages after N&#8208;incorporation. This work paves the way for the precise design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with superior electrochemical properties, advancing their application in dual&#8208;ion storage applications.

         <title>Zwitterionic 2&#8208;Phosphaethene&#8208;thiolates [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ as PCS Building Blocks (LC=NHC, LP=PR3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCS building blocks: This work presents the facile synthesis of zwitterionic salts [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)][OTf], which function as convenient, regioselective and multifaceted synthons of the PCS moiety. DFT calculations support a zwitterionic composition with a negative PCS moiety and two cationic P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents. Depending on the nature of the C&#8208;bound substituent, different reactivity can be addressed in cycloaddition and reduction reactions.







Abstract
The zwitterionic compounds [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ (3+, LC=NHC, LP=PR3), featuring cationic substituents at the phosphorus and carbon atoms, are synthesized as their triflate salts at a multi&#8208;gram scale from the reaction of Lewis base adducts of CS2, namely LC/P&#8722;CS2 (4), with a combination of [(LCP)4][OTf]4 (1[OTf]4) and Ph3P. The feasibility of using 3+ as PCS building blocks is showcased in their reactions with representative electrophiles (MeOTf) and nucleophiles (MesMgBr, Ph3PCH2), leading to selective functionalization of the PCS core at the S&#8208; and P&#8208;terminus, respectively. Additionally, it is reported that 3+ can function as ambident nucleophiles with AgOTf (2 equivalents), affording unprecedented linear coordination polymer [Ag2(OTf)3&#8208;&#956;2:&#954;P,&#954;S&#8722;((LC)P=CS(PCy3))]+ (6&#8201;b), where the PCS moiety acts as a bridging ligand in transition metal complexes for the first time. Reduction of 3+ facilitates the cleavage of the P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents leading to the formation of the [PCS]&#8722; anion. Moreover, cycloaddition reactions of 3+ with 1[OTf]4 are shown to selectively yield five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered polyphosphorus heterocycles. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of activating the C&#8722;S bond in [(LC)P=CS(LC)]+, resulting in the formation of [(LC)P=C(LC)&#8722;P(LC)][OTf]2, 12[OTf]2, which may serve as a synthon for the PCP unit in future studies.

Schematic illustration of FeMn for simultaneously activating both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to maximize the utilization of various substituents of native lignin reforming into syngas over InGaN nanowires.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered lignin reforming offers a carbon&#8208;neutral route for syngas production. This study explores a dual non&#8208;precious iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst to simultaneously activate both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds for maximizing the utilization of various substituents of native lignin to yield syngas. The cocatalyst, integrated with InGaN nanowires on a Si wafer, affords a measurable syngas evolution rate of 42.4&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 from native lignin in distilled water with a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% and tunable H2/CO ratios under concentrated light, leading to a considerable light&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency of 11.8&#8201;%. The high FeMn atom efficiency arising from the 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructure of InGaN enables the achievement of a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 220896&#8197;mol syngas per mol FeMn per hour. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the synergetic iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst supported by InGaN nanowires enables simultaneous activation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds with comparable minimized dissociation energies, thus promising to maximally utilize different substituents of &#8722;OCH3, and &#8722;CH2CH2CH3 in lignin for syngas production. Moreover, the dual Fe&#8208;Mn cocatalyst demonstrates a most energetically favorable route for the consecutive release of hydrogen from &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;OH by the oxidative holes while inhibiting the reversion of hydrogen and hydroxyl into water.

         <title>Chiral Rotaxane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers as Relays in Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting system that shows sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances has been constructed from chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers. This approach not only leads to efficient amplification of the CPL performances but will also allow the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.







Abstract
Starting from AIEgen&#8208;functionalized chiral [2]rotaxane building block, we have successfully synthesized a new class of chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers through controllable divergent strategy for the first time, based on which novel chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHSs) were successfully constructed in aqueous phase by sequentially introducing achiral donor and acceptor. More importantly, accompanied by the two&#8208;step F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process in the resultant artificial LHSs, the sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances were achieved, highlighting that the chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers could serve as excellent relay for both energy transfer and chirality transmission. Impressively, compared with the sole chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values of the resultant artificial LHSs were amplified by one order of magnitude up to 0.038, enabling their further applications in information storage and encryption. The proof&#8208;of concept study provides not only a feasible approach for the efficient amplification of CPL performances but also a novel platform for the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Dual Regulation of Sensitizers and Cluster Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Boost H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy was proposed based on POM@MOF molecular platform to construct the highly efficient catalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Impressively, the resulting Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 can efficiently drive water splitting into H2 with a TON of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composites.







Abstract
Photocatalytic efficiency is closely correlated to visible&#8208;light absorption ability, electron transfer efficiency and catalytic center activity of photocatalysts, nevertheless, the concurrent management of these factors to improve photocatalytic efficiency remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a sensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy on the polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Framework (POM@MOF) molecular platform to construct highly efficient photocatalysts. Impressively, Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6, obtained by coupling strong sensitizing [Ir(coumarin 6)2(bpy)]+ with Ni&#8722;Sb9 POM with extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3], can drive H2 evolution with a turnover number of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composite photocatalysts. This performance is over 34&#8197;times higher than that of the typical Ni4P2@UiO&#8722;Ir constructed from [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and Ni4P2 POM. Systematical investigations revealed that dual regulation of sensitizing and catalytic centers endowed Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 with strong visible&#8208;light absorption, efficient inter&#8208;component electron transfer and high catalytic activity to concurrently promote H2 evolution. This work opens up a new avenue to develop highly active POM@MOF photocatalysts by dual regulation of sensitizing/catalytic centers at the molecular level.

         <title>Better Together: Photoredox/Copper Dual Catalysis in Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of Cu&#8208;ATRP catalysis with photocatalysts (PCs) that absorb visible and/or NIR light exhibits synergistic action at the ppm/ppb concentration level. It leads to very well&#8208;defined polymers with rates depending on the amount and quantum efficiency of PC but controlled polymer architecture defined by the Cu&#8208;catalysts. Thus, they can act much better together, providing robustness, oxygen tolerance, and access to new materials.







Abstract
Photomediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (photoATRP) is an activator regeneration method, which allows for the controlled synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers via light irradiation. Traditional photoATRP is often limited by the need for high&#8208;energy ultraviolet or violet light. These could negatively affect the control and selectivity of the polymerization, promote side reactions, and may not be applicable to biologically relevant systems. This drawback can be circumvented by an introduction of the catalytic amount of photocatalysts, which absorb visible and/or NIR light and, therefore, controlled, regenerative ATRP can be performed with the dual&#8208;catalytic cycle. Herein, a critical summary of recent developments in the field of dual&#8208;catalysis concerning Cu&#8208;catalyzed ATRP is provided. Contributions of involved species are examined mechanistically, followed by challenges and future directions towards the next generation of advanced functional macromolecular materials.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of propeller&#8208;shaped C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric triradicals are described. The triradicals were antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin systems with J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K, leading to the thermal equilibrium of the doublet/quartet states at room temperature. The spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent absorption feature, spin&#8208;selective excitation, and spin&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics are discussed.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of triptycene&#8208;based C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric stable triradicals. SQUID magnetometry showed the propeller&#8208;shaped triradicals were both an antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin system with small spin&#8208;spin interactions J/kB~&#8722;120&#8197;K and &#8722;106&#8197;K, leading to ca. 4/6 coexistence of the doublet/quartet states in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The triradicals exhibited characteristic NIR absorption bands reaching 1000&#8197;nm, which was solely ascribed to the triradical in the doublet state by variable&#8208;temperature spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Taking advantage of the spin&#8208;specific absorption feature, we found that the triradicals in the low&#8208;spin state undergo symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer, while those in the high&#8208;spin state fall into a monoradical&#8208;like excited state.

         <title>Confinement Microenvironment Regulation of Carbon Dots in Zeolite for Multi&#8208;Mode Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy is presented in CDs&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite system to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) induce green phosphorescence, and non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit temperature&#8208;related blue or red phosphorescence due to energy transfer. Finally, multi&#8208;mode time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color evolution with temperature variation in a single system is achieved.







Abstract
Matrix immobilization has been proven to be a favored method for enhancing the phosphorescence of carbon dots (CDs), however, it remains a significant challenge to realize time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPC) by embedding CDs with single emission center. In this study, we present a novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. The surrounding environment influences the surface state of the CDs, leading to the formation of different excitons. At low temperatures, Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) show fast&#8208;decaying green phosphorescence, while non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit inherent slow&#8208;decaying blue phosphorescence. Notably, the energy transfer occurs between NC&#8208;CDs and Mn2+ to produce an ultrafast&#8208;decaying red phosphorescence, with the intensity of the red component increasing as the temperature rises. The interplay of these luminescent centers with distinct decay rates activates fascinating multi&#8208;mode TDPC behavior as the temperature changes, resulting in dynamic afterglow evolutions from red to green at 298&#8197;K, orange to green at 273&#8197;K, and green to cyan to blue at 77&#8197;K. Leveraging the diverse luminescence of CDs@MnAPO&#8208;5, a multi&#8208;dimensional dynamic afterglow color pattern was developed for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

Mn-coordinated CDs (C-CDs) induce green phosphorescence, and non-coordinated CDs (NC-CDs) exhibit temperature-related blue or red phosphorescence due to energy transfer. Finally, multi-mode time-dependent phosphorescence color evolution with temperature variation in a single system is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix immobilization has been proven to be a favored method for enhancing the phosphorescence of carbon dots (CDs), however, it remains a significant challenge to realize time-dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPC) by embedding CDs with single emission center. In this study, we present a novel matrix-controlling strategy to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in zeolite. The surrounding environment influences the surface state of the CDs, leading to the formation of different excitons. At low temperatures, Mn-coordinated CDs (C-CDs) show fast-decaying green phosphorescence, while non-coordinated CDs (NC-CDs) exhibit inherent slow-decaying blue phosphorescence. Notably, the energy transfer occurs between NC-CDs and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to produce an ultrafast-decaying red phosphorescence, with the intensity of the red component increasing as the temperature rises. The interplay of these luminescent centers with distinct decay rates activates fascinating multi-mode TDPC behavior as the temperature changes, resulting in dynamic afterglow evolutions from red to green at 298&#8197;K, orange to green at 273&#8197;K, and green to cyan to blue at 77&#8197;K. Leveraging the diverse luminescence of CDs@MnAPO-5, a multi-dimensional dynamic afterglow color pattern was developed for advanced anti-counterfeiting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen Radical&#8208;Activated Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Buried Heterointerface for Achieving Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Tin&#8208;Based Solar Cells with Efficiencies Surpassing 14&#8201;%</title>

The highly active halogen radicals simultaneously modified the ITO surface and chemically bridged the ITO/perovskite heterointerfaces for largely reducing the interfacial energy barrier and optimizing the interfacial carrier dynamics in hole transport layer&#8208;free Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving a record efficiency of 14.20&#8201;%.







Abstract
Sn&#8208;based perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising environmentally&#8208;friendly photovoltaic materials owing to their low toxicity and exceptional optoelectronic properties. Nonetheless, the low&#8208;cost production and stable operation of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still largely limited by the costly hole transport materials and the under&#8208;optimized interfaces between hole transport layer (HTL) and Sn perovskite layer. Here, we innovatively developed a chlorine radical chemical bridging (Cl&#8208;RCB) strategy that enabled to remove the HTL and optimize the indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite heterointerface for constructing high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based PSCs with simplified structures. The key is to modify the commercially&#8208;purchased ITO electrode with highly active chlorine radicals that could effectively mitigate the surface oxygen vacancies, alter the chemical constitutions, and favorably down&#8208;shifted the work function of ITO surface to be close to the valence band of perovskites. As a result, the interfacial energy barrier has been largely reduced by 0.20&#8197;eV and the interfacial carrier dynamics have been optimized at the ITO/perovskite heterointerface. Encouragingly, the efficiency of HTL&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based PSCs has been enhanced from 6.79&#8201;% to 14.20&#8201;%, which is on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conventional HTL&#8208;containing counterparts (normally &gt;14&#8201;% efficiency) and representing the record performance for the Sn perovskite photovoltaics in the absence of HTL. Notably, the target device exhibited enhanced stability for up to 2000&#8197;h. The Cl&#8208;RCB strategy is also versatile to be used in Pb&#8208;based and mixed Sn&#8722;Pb HTL&#8208;free PSCs, achieving efficiencies of 22.27&#8201;% and 21.13&#8201;%, respectively, all representing the advanced device performances for the carrier transport layer&#8208;free PSCs with simplified device architectures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Bent Perylenediimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bent perylenediimides (B&#8208;PDIs) with systematically varied bending angles were designed and synthesized by modulating the lengths of linear alkyl chains bridging the two nitrogen atoms of each PDI. This study unveils the curvature&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly and excited&#8208;state decay behavior of these B&#8208;PDIs.







Abstract
The properties of &#960;&#8208;functional materials are predominantly influenced by both their molecular structures and interactions between &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent advancements have focused on modifying the geometry or topology of &#960;&#8208;molecules from planar to nonplanar conformations to tailor molecular properties. However, the interactions among nonplanar &#960;&#8208;molecules remain largely unexplored, likely due to the significant reduction in contact surfaces arising from their curved structures. Herein, we investigated the electro&#8208;optical properties and &#960;&#8208;stacking behaviors of a series of bent perylenediimides (B&#8208;PDIs) with gradual changes in bending angles, achieved by altering the lengths of linear alkyl chains connecting the two nitrogen positions of each PDI. Curvature&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly of these bent PDIs is observed, which is primarily driven by dipole&#8208;dipole interactions rather than dispersion forces. More importantly, fine&#8208;tuning intermolecular coupling through bending enables excited&#8208;state symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in [n]B&#8208;PDIs (n = 16, 12) in the crystalline solid state.
