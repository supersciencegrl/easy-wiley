         <title>Boosting Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Sodium&#8208;Bromine Batteries via Chlorine&#8208;Bromine Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operable over a wide temperature range is critical for sustainable energy storage. Sodium&#8208;chlorine (Na&#8208;Cl2) batteries show promising high theoretical energy densities but face significant safety challenges due to gaseous chlorine, particularly at high temperatures. Replacing Cl2 with liquid Br2 to construct a new Na&#8208;Br2 battery mitigates gas risks but introduces issues with sluggish reaction kinetics and high&#8208;temperature volatility. To overcome these limitations, we developed a revolutionary Na&#8208;Br(+) battery based on the activated Br+ by Cl&#8722; anions, pioneering a stabilized redox process via Br&#8722;/BrCl2&#8722; conversion. The introduction of Cl&#8722; enhances the reversibility kinetics of bromine species and facilitating the activation of Br+ through polyanions BrCl2&#8722;, enabling additional electron transfer pathways. The Na&#8208;Br(+) battery achieves impressive low polarization (0.18V) and exhibits wide&#8208;temperature functionality (&#8208;60 oC to 60 oC) with a cycle life exceeding 400 cycles. This heterogeneous halogen activation strategy addresses key gas safety limitations and advances the practicality of metal&#8208;halogen batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Customizable Library of Nickel Trifluoromethylation Catalysts via Selective C&#8210;F and C&#8210;O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a combination of metal&#8208;promoted reactivity, in&#8208;situ covalent bond modification, and hydrogen bonding&#8208;promoted fluorine labilization, a unified approach was developed to self&#8208;assemble a library of customizable ligand architectures directly at the nickel center via selective cleavage of C&#8210;F or C&#8210;O bonds and the formation of C&#8210;C or C&#8210;N bonds. As a result, a structurally diverse set of nickelacarbatrane and pincer complexes was obtained, including unsymmetrical and mixed&#8208;heterocyclic atranes and trifluoromethylated pincers that cannot be accessed by conventional organic synthetic methods or require multiple steps and a tedious and low&#8208;yielding separation. This suggest a possibility of a spontaneous generation of high&#8208;complexity structures from a commonly used metal precursor and simple N&#8208;heterocycle building blocks, despite commonly believed innocence of the C&#8208;F bonds, which may also generate catalytically active species.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical coordination induced fullerene dimers on hot Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fullerene family is known for its unique properties, facilitating the formation of large, lubricated nano&#8208;onions and the fragmentation into small carbon clusters through various processes. In this study, we explore the thermal evolution of C60 islands in Pt(111), focusing on the segregation of C60 islands, the formation of fullerene dimers, and the subsequent development of large graphene sheets. Using non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed that after annealing at 500 K, the C60 islands showed minimal change compared to their deposition at room temperature. However, at 800 K, pairs of separated C60 dimers appeared which, due to their low mobility, have the potential to transform into graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Further annealing at 900K controlled and refined the quality and dimensions of the graphene patches. This process not only provides an effective method for producing high&#8208;quality graphene, but also permits to preserve isolated C60 dimers on the Pt(111) surface, offering valuable insights for advanced synthesis and lubrication applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quaternized&#8208;PAF Architecture Mediated Proton Channels to Enhance Ultra&#8208;Robust Operation for 200&#176;C Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In optimizing the trade&#8208;off between power density and phosphoric acid retention in PA&#8208;doped polybenzimidazole (PA&#8208;PBI) membrane for improving performance of high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs), the self&#8208;reinforcing network of interfacial interactions of the HT&#8208;PEMs has to be deeply investigated. Herein, a breakthrough strategy employing a quaternary ammonium (QA)&#8208;functionalized porous aromatic framework (QPAF&#8208;225) to synergistically integrate with sulfonated poly[2,2&#8217;&#8208;(p&#8208;oxydiphenylene)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;bibenzimidazole] (SOPBI) to form the robust HT&#8208;PEM is successfully developed. The ionic interactions between cationic QA moieties and anionic sulfonic acid groups can establish a self&#8208;reinforcing proton&#8208;conductive network, while the high&#8208;density basic sites in QPAF&#8208;225 acted as PA reservoirs can mitigate the leaking. When benchmarked against QA&#8208;deficient PAF&#8208;225&#8208;10 (10% PAF&#8208;225/SOPBI) and SOPBI, the QPAF&#8208;225&#8208;10 delivers a high proton conductivity (174 mS cm&#8722;1) and extremely high peak power density of 847 mW cm&#8722;2&#160; under ultralow Pt/C loading (0.3 mg cm&#8722;2) at 200&#176;C. Critically, such a membrane exhibits ultralow voltage decay rate (0.04 mV h&#8722;1, 904 h, 200&#176;C) and high PA retention ability, coupled with mechanical robustness exceeding industrial durability thresholds.

         <title>Robust Ionic Gel Elastomers Derived from Molecularly Entangled Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In various types of intelligent devices, such as bionic robots, flexible polymeric elastomeric materials are essential for their operation, alongside the rigid skeleton. Conventional polymeric elastomeric materials, however, encounter a compromise between intelligence and mechanical robustness. Here we construct ionic gel&#8208;based elastomers that harmoniously merge high intelligence with superior mechanical attributes by employing molecularly entangled nodes that facilitate polymer chain entanglement. The entangled nodes&#8217; dynamic interplay enables stress&#8208;induced dissociation, promoting polymer chain slippage that effectively dissipates energy and disperses stress. Consequently, these ionic gel&#8208;based elastomers exhibit a tensile strength of 33.5 &#177; 0.5 MPa and a strain capacity of 4000 &#177; 280%, maintaining stable performance over 7000 cycles, while also possessing the ability to detect minor material defects, thereby advancing the versatility and reliability of intelligent devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Room Temperature Methanol Synthesis over Hcp&#8208;PdMo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hexagonal close&#8208;packed PdMo (hcp&#8208;PdMo) intermetallic catalyst exhibits the room temperature catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanism study revealed that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water&#8208;gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;C) pathway though a Pd&#8208;assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has garnered significant interest with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions; however, the high temperatures and pressures typically required diminish the benefits of this approach. In this study, we report a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;PdMo catalyst that exhibits the highest room temperature catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol among reported catalysts, with 100% methanol selectivity and without any signs of deactivation. Structural analyses, which included various in situ and ex situ X&#8208;ray techniques and infrared spectroscopy, have revealed that Mo and Pd serve as the active sites for CO2 adsorption and H2 dissociation, respectively. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction is facilitated at room temperature on the surface of the hcp&#8208;PdMo intermetallic catalyst, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanistic studies, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water&#8208;gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;C) pathway though a Pd&#8208;assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature. These findings not only reveal the origin of the reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis but also open a new direction for the design of highly efficient catalysts that function under mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;The hexagonal close-packed PdMo (hcp-PdMo) intermetallic catalyst exhibits the room temperature catalytic activity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to methanol, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanism study revealed that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water-gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;amp;C) pathway though a Pd-assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanol has garnered significant interest with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions; however, the high temperatures and pressures typically required diminish the benefits of this approach. In this study, we report a hexagonal close-packed (hcp)-PdMo catalyst that exhibits the highest room temperature catalytic activity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to methanol among reported catalysts, with 100% methanol selectivity and without any signs of deactivation. Structural analyses, which included various in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques and infrared spectroscopy, have revealed that Mo and Pd serve as the active sites for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation, respectively. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation reaction is facilitated at room temperature on the surface of the hcp-PdMo intermetallic catalyst, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanistic studies, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water-gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;amp;C) pathway though a Pd-assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature. These findings not only reveal the origin of the reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis but also open a new direction for the design of highly efficient catalysts that function under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene Protected Superatomic Ag8 Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The all&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic&#8208;carbene&#8208;protected silver cluster containing [Ag8K2(CO3)2]6+ units as the central skeleton of a superatomic silver nanoring was prepared through a one&#8208;pot reaction.








Abstract
Atomically precise monolayer&#8208;protected coinage metal nanoclusters (CMNCs) have drawn increasing attention for their diverse structures and intriguing properties. Nevertheless, not all&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic&#8208;carbene (NHC)&#8208;protected atomically precise silver nanoclusters have been synthesized yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of the first all&#8208;NHC&#8208;protected superatomic silver cluster. This NHC&#8208;ligand&#8208;stabilized Ag8 cluster, characterized as Ag8K2L4(CO3)2(PF6)6, was prepared by reacting Ag2O with bisimidazolium salt H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 under alkaline conditions in dimethylformamide via a one&#8208;pot reaction. The results of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and high&#8208;resolution electrospray&#8208;ionization (HR&#8208;ESI) mass spectrometry revealed a cluster centered with a stable Ag8 ring. Energy decomposition analysis combined with the natural orbital for chemical valence method (EDA&#8208;NOCV) was employed to analyze the nature of the Ag&#8211;ligand bonding, and the results suggested that the stabilization energy originated from the strong electrostatic attraction of the Ag8 ring to the NHC ligand. This work is expected to enable new applications of various NHC ligands in the formation of NHC&#8208;protected metal clusters with attractive properties.

         <title>A Thorough Characterization of the Tellurocyanate Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[K@crypt&#8208;222][TeCN] was synthesized from KCN, Te, and crypt&#8208;222 in acetone. We discuss fundamental properties of [TeCN]&#8722;: Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (13C, 15N, 125Te), vibrational spectroscopy, and negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy. All experimental data is supported by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.








Abstract
Tellurocyanate, [TeCN]&#8722;, is the heaviest group 16 congener of the cyanate anion, [OCN]&#8722;. Due to the relative instability of the C&#9472;Te bond, tellurocyanate chemistry has seen only scarce attention. Here, we present the facile synthesis and thorough characterization of [K@crypt&#8208;222][TeCN]. The anion is essentially linear with interatomic distances C&#9472;N&#160;=&#160;1.150(6)&#197; and C&#9472;Te&#160;=&#160;2.051(4)&#197;, thus approximating a C&#8801;N triple bond and for C&#9472;Te a bond order between 1 and 2. Fully 13C and 15N labeled [Te13C15N]&#8722; allowed for the extraction of chemical shifts and all possible coupling constants (13C&#160;=&#160;77.8 ppm, 15N&#160;=&#160;285.7&#160;ppm, 125Te&#160;=&#160;&#8722;566&#160;ppm, 1J13C&#8208;15N&#160;=&#160;8 Hz, 1J13C&#8208;125Te&#160;=&#160;748&#160;Hz, 2J15N&#8208;125Te&#160;=&#160;55&#160;Hz), which were also determined independently by quantum chemical calculations. In the series [ChCN]&#8722; (Ch&#160;=&#160;O&#9472;Te), [TeCN]&#8722; shows the strongest spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) induced heavy&#8208;atom effect on the light&#8208;atom shielding (SO&#8208;HALA&#8208;effect). In contrast, 15N shifts are also well described without considering relativistic effects and/or SOC. Negative&#8208;ion photoelectron spectroscopy was used to extract the electron affinity (EA&#160;=&#160;3.034&#160;eV) and spin&#8208;orbit splitting (3807&#160;cm&#8722;1) of [TeCN]&#8226;. These values continue the trends of falling EA and rising SOC in the series [ChCN]&#8226;.

         <title>Hydroenergy Inspiring Large&#8208;Scale Piezoelectric Catalysis for Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroenergy inspiring large&#8208;scale piezo&#8208;catalysis for seawater H2 evolution was firstly achieved by combining ternary piezo&#8208;catalyst system and a hydrocyclone, and this combination of hydroenergy and mature chemical equipment to replace traditional ultrasound provided prototype for engineering application of large&#8208;scale piezo&#8208;catalysis.








Abstract
The piezoelectric effect presents a promising avenue for harvesting and utilizing low&#8208;grade mechanical energy. However, challenges from lacking matched industrial equipment and maintaining catalytic performance during scaling up impede the engineering of piezo&#8208;catalysis. Here, utilizing mechanical energy of water to inspire piezoelectricity, a successful attempt at large&#8208;scale piezo&#8208;catalysis seawater H2 evolution was reported for the first time, exhibiting an efficiency of 36.82% for converting mechanical energy to hydrogen energy. A scaling&#8208;up test with 20&#160;L of seawater was conducted, yielding an H2 production rate of 0.73&#160;L h&#8722;1, which just occupied 0.7&#160;m2. This performance (1.04&#160;L h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2) exceeds the large&#8208;scale photocatalytic pure water H2 production by panel reactor array (0.18&#8764;0.25&#160;L h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2) reported in 2021. Additionally, the H2 evolution activity of the 20&#160;L system showed no obvious decline compared with the 50&#160;mL system before scaling&#8208;up, owing to the utilization of ternary piezo&#8208;catalysts system, which capitalized on the synergistic coupling effect of kinetics and thermodynamics. This attempt provides a prototype for pursuing large&#8208;scale piezo&#8208;catalysis and practical engineering application.

         <title>Thermally Gated Covalent Adaptivity in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Stable Actuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid exchangeable LCE with catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;AC/A DCB of high temperature active&#8208;threshold, which could be fabricated to actuators efficiently at 160&#160;&#176;C, while maintaining inert below the &#8220;thermal gate&#8221; at 120&#160;&#176;C, sustaining unprecedented stability over 10&#160;000 actuation cycles. The switch between reprogrammability and actuation stability is permanently reversible.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), with reversible actuation of large and anisotropic deformation, have surged in smart materials such as soft robotics, sensors and artificial muscles. LCEs incorporating dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) endowing network with rearranging ability through reversible bond exchange, facilitating the fabrication of soft actuators with tailored actuation modes and reprogrammability. However, unintended activation of DCBs during actuation, particularly under thermal perturbations, remains a critical challenge, as it damages actuation stability which arises catastrophic failure and potential security risks in practical applications. Present strategies in enhancing actuation stability either achieve only transient stability or sacrificed reprogrammability or actuation performance. Here, we propose a strategy incorporating catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;AC/A DCB of high temperature active&#8208;threshold to fabricate stable exchangeable LCE actuators with thermally gated behavior. This design exhibits a &#8220;thermal gate&#8221; at 120&#160;&#176;C with inert bond exchange below this threshold, yet rapidly activated at 160&#160;&#176;C. The integrated permanent crosslinks further prevent unintended chain slippage, ensuring topological stability. The resulting exchangeable LCE could be fabricated to actuators efficiently and exhibiting unprecedented durability at 120&#160;&#176;C (sustaining 10&#160;000 actuation cycles). The switch between reprogrammability and actuation stability are long&#8208;standing reversible, meeting the demands of long&#8208;term service without compromising its reprogrammability.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Radical Relay for Remote Alkenylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H Sites in Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Electrophotochemical cerium&#8208;catalyzed radical relay strategy enabling &#948;&#8208;site alkenylation of alcohols. This protocol eliminates the requirement for external redox agents and expensive photosensitizers, directly utilizing hydroxyl groups without preactivation of alcohol substrates, thereby significantly enhancing atom economy and environmental benignity. The reaction demonstrates exceptional compatibility with diverse alcohols and alkenes, greatly expanding the scope of accessible products. Mechanistic investigations have conclusively elucidated the detailed catalytic cycle and radical transfer pathway.








Abstract
The Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction is a powerful method for alkene formation from various molecules; however, its application has traditionally been limited to halogenated compounds. Accessing organic molecules with halogen atoms at specific positions in aliphatic systems is highly restricted, and their synthesis is extremely difficult. Therefore, achieving site&#8208;selective alkenylation of alkyl compounds at specific positions remains challenging. This paper presents a versatile redox&#8208;neutral method for the alkenylation of long&#8208;chain alkyl alcohols at unactivated &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H sites, enabling the construction of alkenols through electrophotochemical (EPC) cerium (Ce) catalysis with free alcohols. The method demonstrates excellent substrate compatibility, facilitating the use of both primary and secondary alcohols and enabling the successful synthesis of quaternary carbon alkenols. Mechanistically, cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal that the oxidative reaction is driven by electrochemical oxidation at the anode under applied potential. Additionally, styrene boronic acid remains unoxidized during the reaction, confirming a radical addition mechanism rather than a radical&#8211;radical coupling process. UV&#8211;vis experiments further demonstrate that the ligand not only activates the alkene boronic acid but also functions as a base to promote the ligand exchange between alcohol and Ce(IV)&#8722;Cl species.

         <title>Thermally Triggered Redox Flexibility of Pt/CeO2 Cluster Catalyst Against In&#8208;Situ Atomic Redispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic redispersion of aggregated metal sites is particularly significant in catalyst dynamics. However, this evolution still lacks in&#8208;depth understanding and is usually accompanied by a saturated coordination environment of metal atoms, leading to inferior catalytic activity. Via high&#8208;temperature thermal aging at 800&#160;&#176;C, the surface hydroxyls are largely removed, and then the cluster structure is maintained. The well&#8208;preserved Pt/CeO2 cluster catalyst delivers high catalytic activity, which shows promising prospects in the oxidative elimination of many other volatile organic compounds.








Abstract
For supported catalysts, the redispersion of aggregated metal sites into single atoms is dictated by the reactant&#8208;induced metal&#8208;support interaction, which may also deteriorate the intrinsic activity. Here we discovered the spontaneous redispersion of CeO2&#8208;supported Pt clusters into Pt single atoms during catalytic CO oxidation, driven by Pt&#8208;CeO2 interaction with surface hydroxyls as the key stabilizer. This structural evolution was accompanied by deactivation, leading to inferior catalytic activity. After achieving the clear distinction of PtOx clusters and Pt single atoms, we propose a thermal aging strategy to preserve the Pt clusters against redispersion. The high&#8208;temperature calcination at 800&#160;&#176;C significantly removed the surface hydroxyls of Pt/CeO2, thereby eliminating the anchoring sites for Pt redispersion and consequently preserving the Pt clusters. Moreover, the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox cycles were triggered, enabling the interfacial Ce3+ sites to fulfill O2 activation. Together with the enhanced CO adsorption on Pt clusters over single atoms, this redox flexibility in valence change delivered superior activity for CO oxidation.

         <title>Emerging Porous Conductive Ion&#8208;Selective Membranes for Sustainable Energy Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous conductive ion&#8208;selective membranes (PCIMs) enable low&#8208;resistance, high&#8208;selectivity ion transport in sustainable energy devices. This review explores emerging PCIMs with sub&#8208;nano/nanometer pores, focusing on ion transport mechanisms, key pore characteristics, and design strategies. It also highlights advances in PCIM applications, including fuel cells, flow batteries, and Li&#8212;S batteries. By integrating theory with design principles, this review provides insights for optimizing PCIMs and advancing membrane&#8208;based energy technologies.








Abstract
Porous conductive ion&#8208;selective membranes (PCIMs), as key components of sustainable energy devices, have attracted widespread research interest owing to their unique pore structures and properties for achieving low&#8208;resistance high&#8208;ion&#8208;selectivity transport. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency PCIMs remains challenging, and the intricate relationship between the structural properties of PCIMs and its pivotal influence on the performance of energy devices is not well explored. This review focuses on emerging PCIMs with sub&#8208;nano/nanometer pores, particularly their design strategies, and fabrication processes. First, the theorical mechanisms underlying ion transfer in confined pores is comprehensively discussed. Subsequently, the effect of a series of pore characteristics&#8212;including size, charge, geometry, orientation, and durability on ion&#8208;selective transport and their regulation strategies are discussed and summarized. Then, effective and universally known methods for designing and adjusting PCIMs containing intrinsic pores, induced pores, and composite pores are highlighted. Furthermore, the progresses of PCIM applications in emerging electrochemical energy devices including fuel cells, flow batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries, and concentration batteries are summarized. Overall, this review aims to provide a valuable reference for scholars and researchers dedicated to the study of PCIMs, thereby contributing to the ongoing progress in this field.

         <title>Harmonizing Nanoparticle Exsolution From Ce&#8211;Sm Oxide Matrix for Stable Methane Dry Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of moderately exsolved Rh nanoparticles was achieved on the catalyst surface through exsolution from the Ce&#8211;Sm oxide matrix. Due to the balanced metal&#8208;support interaction, the catalyst shows antisintering and coke&#8208;resistant performance in the methane dry reforming stability test.








Abstract
Catalyst deactivation hinders the application of high&#8208;temperature catalysis such as methane dry reforming, where nanoparticle exsolution will likely clear the path. However, the harsh reaction conditions often easily unbalance the exsolution degree, leading to either sintering or insufficient exsolution of metal nanoparticles. Here, we achieve the fabrication of highly dispersed yet exposed Rh nanoparticles exsolved from the Ce&#8211;Sm oxide matrix. Starting from examining the metal&#8208;support interaction of Rh&#8211;CeO2 and Rh&#8211;Sm2O3, the exsolution dynamics of Rh nanoparticles are studied via multiple in situ techniques. Rapid exsolution from CeO2 induces Rh sintering and catalytic deactivation, whereas sluggish exsolution from Sm2O3 results in Rh encapsulation with poor activity. The balanced metal&#8208;support interaction harmonizes the exsolution of Rh nanoparticles from the Ce&#8211;Sm oxide matrix, fabricating an antisintering and coke&#8208;resistant catalyst for methane dry reforming. This work provides insights into the development of catalysts with structural robustness, where the essence lies in the engineering of nanoparticle exsolution.

         <title>Alleviation of Precursor Degradation Induced by DMF/DMSO Mixture for Enhanced Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical instability in perovskite precursor critically hinders the development of high&#8208;performance PSCs. We reveal that side reaction chains accelerate precursor aging in the commonly used DMF/DMSO co&#8208;solvent system. DMF hydrolysis products catalyze DMSO&#8208;driven oxidation of I&#8315; ions, accompanied by the generation of H2O, which further amplifies the degradation cycle. 2&#8208;thiouracil (Th) effectively suppresses the deprotonation of amine cations and I&#8315; oxidation, enabling proper crystallization of perovskites.








Abstract
The precursor quality critically determines the morphology, grain size, crystallinity, and trap state density of the perovskite films. A long shelf life of the perovskite precursor could greatly benefit the reliable upscaling of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we suggest that the most commonly used N, N&#8208;Dimethylformamide/Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF/DMSO) mixed solvent exhibits more severe degradation compared to its corresponding single solvents, due to the complex interplay of reactions, including hydrolysis, oxidation, and deprotonation of precursor species in the solution. 2&#8208;thiouracil (Th) was thus introduced into the precursor to inhibit these side reaction chains and effectively alleviate the detrimental degradation of cations and iodide ions (I&#8315;). The synergistic effects of Th allow it to bind with undercoordinated Pb2+, modulating the crystallization process and thereby achieving high&#8208;quality films with a low defect density. Consequently, Th&#8208;based precursor demonstrates enhanced shelf life, retaining 94.78% of the initial efficiency (25.13%) of the device prepared from fresh solution after 30 days of aging, compared to 64.22% for the control sample. The target device also exhibits remarkable stability, maintaining 87.8% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>A Universal P&#8208;Type Heterointerface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal p&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite was constructed using the heterocyclic dipolar compound imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI), enabling effective hole extraction from perovskite to SAMs and significantly reducing charge recombination. As a result, the optimized solar cells reached 26.05% and demonstrated excellent stability.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells with self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. However, the hole extraction at the SAMs/perovskite interface is generally less efficient with respect to the electron extraction. Here, we report the construction of a universal p&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite with heterocyclic dipolar compounds imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI). We found that the strong interaction by hydrogen bonds together with formative dipole layer were observed between ImHI and perovskite. This allows more p&#8208;type contacts with relatively small energy barriers at SAMs/perovskite heterointerfaces by downshifting the Fermi level, reducing the energy mismatch and facilitating the hole extraction. The p&#8208;type contact enhancement was further confirmed by a series of SAMs at the perovskite buried interface. As a result, a best&#8208;performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000&#160;h under nitrogen&#8208;filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800&#160;h at 55&#160;&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000&#160;h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.

         <title>Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Toluene to Benzaldehyde by Parallel Photoinduced Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Energy Transfer Through Multiphoton Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In response to the challenges of peroxidation and undesirable side reactions associated with the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde in industrial processes, we synthesized a three&#8208;dimensional porous Zn&#8208;AQ framework using Zn and Na as nodes and anthraquinone as the ligand through a coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy. The high selectivity of lattice oxygen combined with the high efficiency of parallel multiphoton produces an excellent synergistic effect, which enables the oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde with the high selectivity of 93.7% and the TOF of 2.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Selectively aerobic oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde is an important but challenging task due to the high proclivity of aldehydes to undergo over&#8208;oxidation to acids. Herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach for synthesizing benzaldehyde from toluene by integrating oxygen vacancy and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events into one coordination polymer (Zn&#8208;AQ) to enhance efficiency and selectivity. Under light irradiation, the ligand facilitates photoinduced PCET and photoinduced energy transfer (EnT), generating radical species from the C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and highly active 1O2 species. The &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions between the ligands enforced the metal centers to form Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Na&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Na polyoxometalate chains with oxygen vacancy sites for the selective oxidation of the radical intermediate. Zn&#8208;AQ endows the efficient and selective oxidation of aromatic benzyl C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds into aldehydes, including the conversion of toluene into benzaldehyde with the selectivity up to 94%, by combining the energies of three photons in one catalytic cycle. The first reported multiphoton catalytic strategy combines oxygen vacancy catalysis with PCET C(sp3)&#9472;H bond activation mode, providing new ideas for the design of aerobic oxidation photocatalysts for target C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds oxidation in a mild, efficient, and highly selective manner.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Sp2 Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Accelerated Exciton Process for Superior Singlet Oxygen Photosynthesis for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing fully conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs, a facile strategy was proposed to regulate the exciton interaction and intersystem crossing (ISC) process, which significantly enhances Coulomb interaction, promotes ISC and pushes forward the transfer of excitons to the O2 adsorption sites throughout the COFs matrix, thereby enabling a record&#8208;high singlet oxygen yield with 100% selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen (O2) activation via energy transfer offers a sustainable approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis, while its performance suffers from the ultrafast exciton dissociation and sluggish intersystem crossing (ISC) process. Up to date, exciton regulation is still in its infancy. Here, via linkage engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we propose a fully conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs) with strong exciton interaction and fast ISC for boosted 1O2 photosynthesis. The sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs delivers a record&#8208;high 1O2 yield (624 &#181;M min&#8722;1) with 100% selectivity, which is ca. eight times that of the traditional imine&#8208;bridged COFs (Im&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs, ca. 95.8% selectivity), outperforming documented systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the fully conjugated sp2 carbon linkage of sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs can enhance Coulomb interaction, promote ISC and push forward the transfer of triplet exciton to the O2 adsorption sites throughout the COFs matrix, jointly facilitating the energy transfer process for efficient 1O2 photosynthesis and bypassing the traditional electron transfer process. Hence, sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs can selectively degrade acetaminophen within minutes under visible light irradiation and enables stable degradation of emerging pollutants in a continuous flow membrane reactor (20&#160;&#215;&#160;30&#160;&#215; 2&#160;cm) utilizing natural sunlight and dissolved O2.

         <dc:description>We synthesize and evaluate a diverse range of Mn/TiO2 catalysts with varying physical and redox properties for the methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester reaction using molecular oxygen in a diluted acid medium (10 wt% trifluoroacetic acid). Despite initial differences in manganese distributions, nearly all catalysts are active under the reaction conditions, and the degree of activity is partially correlated to catalyst reducibility in hydrogen temperature programmed reduction and manganese K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Under methane&#8208;limited conditions, exceptionally high product yields of up to ca. 30% are obtained. Catalysts synthesized with a co&#8208;precipitation method demonstrate the highest productivity (up to 1440 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) in methane&#8208;excess conditions and the full activity can be restored in a subsequent reaction cycle upon a mild thermal treatment. Under high conversion conditions, the co&#8208;precipitated catalyst can achieve methane&#8208;based product yields of ca. 15%. The performance of Mn/TiO2 catalysts using molecular oxygen under less corrosive conditions surpasses that of other heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroarylation of Allenes: Formal Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of allene&#8208;tethered pyrroles and indoles that provides access to relevant heterocyclic systems bearing vinyl&#8208;substituted 3ry or 4ry stereocenters is reported. Its synthetic potential was exemplified with a very short, highly enantioselective formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam, whereas DFT computational studies allowed to rationalize the key factors that control the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the process.








Abstract
We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydroarylation of allenyl&#8208;tethered pyrroles and indoles. The reaction, promoted by an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, provides a direct access heteropolycyclic systems bearing either tertiary or quaternary carbon stereocenters and a synthetically appealing alkenyl pendant. The method allows a highly efficient assembly of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and even seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, providing enantiomeric excesses of up to 99%. DFT computational studies align nicely with the experimental results and allow to rationalize the key factors that control both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the process. Finally, the synthetic potential of the method was exemplified with a very short, highly enantioselective formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam.

         <title>Scalable H2O2 Production via O2 Reduction Using Immobilized Vanadyl Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical H2O2 production via 2e&#8315; ORR is a green alternative to the emission&#8208;heavy anthraquinone process, but selectivity at practical current remains low. We develop a vanadium catalyst composite achieving&#160;&gt;90% H&#8322;O&#8322; selectivity at 3.5 A cm&#8722;2 in acid. In situ spectroscopy shows robust vanadium coordination preserves *OOH and suppresses O&#9472;O bond cleavage under high cathodic potentials.








Abstract
The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, achieving selective H2O2 production at practically relevant current densities (i.e., ampere&#8208;level) remains challenging due to significant selectivity deterioration at high rates. In this study, we develop a composite catalyst by immobilizing vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) on carbon nanotube (CNT) substrates and evaluate its performance under conditions relevant to practical ORR electrolysis. Encouragingly, the VOPc/CNT catalyst composite achieves a high ORR current density of up to 3.5 A cm&#8722;2 with over 90% selectivity toward H2O2 in acidic media. Through various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the structural integrity of the vanadium catalytic center in VOPc plays a pivotal role in stabilizing *OOH adsorption and impeding O&#9472;O cleavage under high cathodic potentials, which is critical for achieving high H&#8322;O&#8322; selectivity at elevated current densities.

         <title>MOF Coating Enhances the Ion Tolerance of Micromotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reported a novel method to significantly enhance the ion tolerance of EMNMs using a MOF coating via controllable heteroepitaxial growth, enabling effective motion in high&#8208;salt environments and propulsion through biological tissues under 980&#160;nm NIR light, with potential applications in targeted drug delivery.








Abstract
Electrophoretic&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors (EMNMs) offer great potential for biomedical applications due to their design flexibility. However, they face challenges in high&#8208;salt environments, where ionic quenching disrupts propulsion by collapsing the electrical double layer. This study introduces a versatile strategy by coating EMNMs with a MOF porous scaffold (ZIF&#8208;8), which acts as ion&#8208;conductive channels that replace the electrical Debye layers and support propulsion in high&#8208;salt solutions. Through a heteroepitaxial growth process, ZIF&#8208;8 was precisely coated on silicon micromotors, a typical model for EMNMs, significantly enhancing their ion tolerance. By optimizing both the MOF layer and the geometry factor, the micromotors achieved effective motion in PBS solution, comparable to blood salt levels, with their ion tolerance (EI50) improving by up to 266 times compared to uncoated micromotors. Additionally, the micromotors maintained stable, controllable motion under 980&#160;nm NIR light, even when passing through an artificial blood vessel covered with biological tissues. In addition, the ZIF&#8208;8 coating offers drug&#8208;loading capabilities and pH&#8208;responsive release, along with biocompatibility, making these micromotors suitable for targeted drug delivery. This MOF coating strategy is versatile and scalable, and can be extended to other types of EMNMs, significantly enhancing their ion tolerance and unlocking new possibilities for biomedical applications.

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of thio&#8208;tetracosulene 3, a highly twisted chiral macrocycle constructed via sulfur fluorine annulative substitution from a cyclometaphenylene derivative. It is the first macrocyclic aromatic compound with a plectonemic configuration, and the structure is unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study. The two enantiomers of 3 can be resolved to investigate their chiroptical properties. In contrast to the known topological knot&#8208;, or M&#246;bius&#8208;type macrocycles which induce chirality by specific connection patterns, the asymmetric structure of 3 is formed and maintained by the tendency of a ring in distress to reduce unfavorable strains.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible&#8208;Linked Oligomeric Acceptors: Precise Synthesis and Enhanced Photovoltaic/Mechanical Properties for Stretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are among the most promising technologies for wearable power applications. However, the development of electron acceptors that simultaneously meet the demands for high performance and mechanical stretchability remains a significant challenge. In this study, we creatively synthesized three oligomeric acceptors with flexible linkers (2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT) and achieved both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs. Benefiting from an improved fibrous morphology and excellent charge dynamics, rigid OSCs based on 4YF&#8208;T demonstrated a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.76%, outperforming devices based on 2YF&#8208;Br and 6YF&#8208;BT. Additionally, the thermal stability of rigid OSCs progressively improved with increasing molecular weight, from 2YF&#8208;Br to 6YF&#8208;BT. Furthermore, the enlarged molecular weight of the acceptors significantly enhanced mechanical stretchability, with crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) values of 16.11%, 20.62%, and 25.92% for 2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT, respectively. Importantly, as molecular weight increased, the mechanical robustness of IS&#8208;OSCs also improved, with 6YF&#8208;BT&#8208;based devices achieving remarkable stretchability (strain at PCE80% = 35%). This study introduces a new class of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptors with well&#8208;defined structures, paving the way for the advancement and practical application of IS&#8208;OSCs in wearable electronics.</dc:description>

This study introduces a new class of high-molecular-weight acceptors with well-defined structures, paving the way for the advancement and practical application of IS-OSCs in wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Assisted Nonradiative Processes to Couple Photothermy and Photosensitization for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonradiative (NR) processes are pivotal in engineering materials with tailored properties for energy utilization. However, their intrinsic rapidity and competitiveness pose huge challenges in on&#8208;demand manipulation. Herein, radical&#8208;assisted multiple NR processes were achieved to couple photothermy and photosensitization based on a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing diradical&#8208;featured croconium (CR) dendrimer, CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe. This dendrimer is well&#8208;designed by the direct covalent linkage between the flexible dendritic diphenylamine (DPA) and rigid diradical&#8208;featured CR units. The intrinsic diradical characteristics promote internal conversions in company with intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, and the hyperfine coupling effect between the dimeric radical&#8208;ion pair excitons and adjacent magnetic nuclei assists intersystem crossing. Besides, the abundant intramolecular motions from the twisted and flexible dendritic diphenylamine groups facilitate vibrational relaxation and electron transfer. These processes endow CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 85.05% and superoxide anion generation capability under 808 nm laser irradiation. Thus, a water evaporation efficiency of 92.6% and antibacterial efficacy under one sunlight are obtained, comprehensively superior to previously&#8208;reported organic small&#8208;molecule photothermal materials for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. These findings highlight the importance of radicals in NR process manipulation, and significantly boosting the development of organic functional materials with on&#8208;demand excited&#8208;state energy conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Library of Stereoregular Polythioesters for Stereocomplex Formation Enabled by Isomerization&#8208;Driven Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular stereocomplexation is an important tool to advance sustainable polymers, and oxygen&#8208;containing polymers represent the most widely studied materials for stereocomplexation. However, the sulfur&#8208;containing analogues, a newly emerged class of sustainable polymers, remain essentially unexplored because of a significant challenge encountered in the synthesis of stereoregular polymers and relatively low supramolecular interaction. In this contribution, by the utilization of [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8211; as a metal&#8208;free cationic initiator, controlled isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (IROPs) of nine examples of chiral five&#8208;membered thionolactones have been achieved with free or suppressed racemization via unique monomer&#8208;stabilized SN2 propagation mechanism, which allows an unprecedented access to a library of new stereoregular polythioesters with high isotacticities (80.0~99.5%). The investigations into structure&#8208;stereocomplexation relationship lead to the disclosure of two new polythioester stereocomplexes with high melting temperatures (117.0~161.0 &#176;C). The fundamental aspects of stereocomplex formation mechanism and critical factors that affect stereocomplexed ability have also been revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of 3D Metal Cluster&#8208;based COFs with Record High&#8208;Connectivity for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of metal clusters with organic building units by covalent bonds to form crystalline metal cluster&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (MCCOFs) material is a novel strategy in the field of reticular synthesis. However, only 2, 3, and 6 connectivity (valency) of metal cluster&#8208;based MCCOFs have been achieved in reported structures. Developing a higher connectivity remains a great challenge in the MCCOFs structural design due to the difficulties for introducing multiple connecting nodes to metal cluster. In this work, two crystalline 3D [8+2]&#8208;connected MCCOFs were synthesized by condensing an 8&#8208;connectivity aluminum cluster&#8208;based building block (termed Al8&#8208;8c) with linear dialdehyde linkers. Furthermore, these AlCCOFs showed efficient photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion due to the suitable energy band structure, efficient photoelectron conversion capability and highly dispersed active sites. Especially, the AlCCOF&#8208;1 showed high H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 16794.69 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 7.1% at 420 nm. The in situ EPR, in situ FTIR and DFT calculations were then performed to study the structure&#8208;function relationships on the two AlCCOFs for H2O2 photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cobotic, Digitally&#8208;Controlled Schlenk&#8208;line Unlocks Access to Elusive Lewis&#8208;base stabilised Copper Bis(Disilylamides)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silylamides are important ligands in coordination chemistry for their ability to stabilize low&#8208;coordination numbers and provide soluble, and even volatile, metal complexes. Such compounds provide valuable insights into the fundamental bonding and reactivity of their respective metals. Despite the wealth of homo&#8208; and heteroleptic hexamethyldisilazide complexes of divalent 3d ions (Sc&#8208;Ni, Zn), attempts to access the corresponding divalent copper complexes have, to date, yielded only Cu(I) species. Herein, we demonstrate the stabilization and isolation of a Cu(II) bis&#8208;hexamethyldisilazide which was achieved by the implementation of digital chemistry tools. In order to successfully isolate (DMAP)CuII(N{SiMe3}2)2 (DMAP = N,N&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) we investigated the roles of the co&#8208;ligand and silylamide transfer reagent in the kinetics of its formation. Crucial to these studies was our newly&#8208;developed &#8216;Cobotic&#8217; Schlenk&#8208;line which allows for digital control of the atmosphere under which we conduct our highly reactive syntheses. In digitizing Schlenk&#8208;line handling, we have improved synthetic productivity by creating protocols for automated inertization, solvent evaporation, liquid handling and crystallization all while capturing reaction log data. Importantly our Cu silylamide synthesis provides a case study showing that our cobotics approach allows for the discovery and isolation of unstable species which may remain elusive by traditional manual or fully autonomous methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Ratchet Mechanism Accelerates Regioselective Metal&#8208;Cation Exchange in a Heterobimetallic Helicate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular machines rely on their capacity to exploit non&#8208;equilibrium processes to perform work. However, the development of these non&#8208;equilibrium processes, such as molecular ratchets, is still in its early stages. Here, we report a diazocine&#8208;containing ligand (L) harbouring two distinct chelating coordination sites that can self&#8208;sort into dinuclear homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic helicates ([FeII2L](OTf)4, [CoII2L](OTf)4, [ZnII2L](OTf)4, [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4, [ZnIICoIIL](OTf)4) with precisely controlled metal cation distribution. The photoisomerisation of the helicates operates via a molecular ratchet mechanism, resulting in metastable diastereomers that shift the system from thermodynamic equilibrium. Continuous white&#8208;light irradiation autonomously drives this ratchet process, selectively enriching an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pseudo&#8208;mesocate structure. Crucially, the ratchet mechanism can significantly accelerate metal&#8208;cation exchange from the [ZnII2L](OTf)4 helicate to the [ZnIIFeIIL](OTf)4 helicate. Thus, the system operates in a manner reminiscent of a &#8220;claw machine&#8221;, selectively seizing FeII ions when subjected to a precisely controllable external stimulus. These findings lay the foundation for creating adaptive and reconfigurable supramolecular structures that use non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena on a molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Engineered Acridine Derivatives Serve as Metal&#8208;Free and Self&#8208;Sensitized Catalysts for Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 to Formic Acid with High&#8208;Efficiency and Near&#8208;Perfect Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient and selective light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to formic acid is a significant scientific challenge, particularly when utilizing purely organic, metal&#8208;free, and earth&#8208;abundant element&#8208;based molecule photocatalysts. Herein, we first reported the discovery of acridine derivatives (DADN, PXZN, PTZN) as new&#8208;type, metal&#8208;free, self&#8208;sensitized molecule catalysts that enabled exceptional performance in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid. Notably, the atomically engineered sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycle PTZN demonstrated unprecedented formate yield rate of 47.8 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, and &gt; 99% selectivity in a photocatalytic system using 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;3&#8208;ium (BI+) as proton and electron relay. The superior activity of PTZN was revealed to arise from its synergistic combination of strong CO2 binding affinity (&#8208;0.195 eV), prolonged charge&#8208;separated states (11 ns), and robust CO2 electronic coupling (2.51 eV). Comprehensive studies including in&#8208;situ electron spin resonance, in&#8208;situ infrared, and transient absorption spectroscopy unambiguously unveiled a direct single electron transfer process from the excited singlet&#8208;state acridine derivatives to CO2, generating CO2&#8729;&#8208;. Moreover, a hydrogen atom transfer process utilizing in&#8208;situ generated BIH as a hydrogen atom carrier enabled the conversion of CO2&#8729;&#8208; to formic acid. This work establishes the first demonstration of a sequential proton&#8208;electron transfer mechanism in acridine&#8208;based photocatalysis, resolving long&#8208;standing challenges in proton and electron delivery during CO2 activation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Achieving efficient and selective light-driven CO2 conversion to formic acid is a significant scientific challenge, particularly when utilizing purely organic, metal-free, and earth-abundant element-based molecule photocatalysts. Herein, we first reported the discovery of acridine derivatives (DADN, PXZN, PTZN) as new-type, metal-free, self-sensitized molecule catalysts that enabled exceptional performance in solar-driven CO2 reduction to formic acid. Notably, the atomically engineered sulfur-containing heterocycle PTZN demonstrated unprecedented formate yield rate of 47.8 mmol g-1 h-1, and &amp;gt; 99% selectivity in a photocatalytic system using 1,3-dimethyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-3-ium (BI+) as proton and electron relay. The superior activity of PTZN was revealed to arise from its synergistic combination of strong CO2 binding affinity (-0.195 eV), prolonged charge-separated states (11 ns), and robust CO2 electronic coupling (2.51 eV). Comprehensive studies including in-situ electron spin resonance, in-situ infrared, and transient absorption spectroscopy unambiguously unveiled a direct single electron transfer process from the excited singlet-state acridine derivatives to CO2, generating CO2&#8729;-. Moreover, a hydrogen atom transfer process utilizing in-situ generated BIH as a hydrogen atom carrier enabled the conversion of CO2&#8729;- to formic acid.

         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics and inadequate redox activity in conventional vanadium&#8208;based cathodes. Herein, a thermal oxidation phase&#8208;engineering strategy is proposed to construct a comprising VSSe core and oxygen&#8208;enriched VO2 and V2O5 interfaces&#8208;phase heterojunction cathode.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Indium Sulfide Catalyst for Efficient and Robust Electrocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing strategy has been developed to prepare the reduction&#8211;corrosion resistant indium sulfide in the tetragonal phase for the efficient and stable electroconversion of CO2 to formate. 








Abstract
The reduction&#8211;reconstruction of the catalyst under negative bias has been identified as a significant rationale underlying the performance degradation of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Screening catalysts with stable phases and robust crystal structures appears to be a feasible approach to counteract the reduction corrosion. In this work, with the guidance of computational predictions, a tetragonal phase In2S3 electrocatalyst is designed through a self&#8208;healing strategy for the conversion of CO2 to formate. Remarkably, In2S3 exhibits superior stability for over 200&#160;h at a current density of &#8764;210&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a persistent formate faradaic efficiency of &#8764;97%. A series of in situ spectroscopic measurements confirm that In2S3 maintains the structural and valence state integrity throughout the reaction. Combined with density functional theory calculations, the performance enhancement mechanism and self&#8208;healing principle of In2S3 are clearly elucidated. This work provides a novel perspective for the design of highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Three&#8208;Motif Molecular Junction Covalent Organic Frameworks for Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of anhydride&#8208;based three&#8208;motif molecular junction covalent organic frameworks has been successfully synthesized through a melt polymerization method that can serve as dual&#8208;electrode active materials for symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries.








Abstract
The symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries (SAOBs) based on the same organic electrode materials for both cathode and anode are promising in achieving an efficient battery system with excellent electrode compatibility, compensable volume change, full discharge ability, low preparation cost, and simple operation procedure, etc. Herein, for the first time, we have designed a kind of anhydride&#8208;based three&#8208;motif molecular junction COFs (i.e., TAT&#8208;AZO&#8208;COF) through a melt polymerization method that can serve as dual&#8208;electrode active materials for SAOBs. The prepared TAT&#8208;AZO&#8208;COF with three&#8208;motif molecular junction units, resulting from the integration of a cathode&#8208;active carbonyl group, an anode&#8208;active azo group, and a changeably bipolar&#8208;active triazin group, could provide a tunable voltage inductive effect to simultaneously meet the requirements of SAOBs. Thus&#8208;assembled SAOBs display excellent rate performance, high energy density (125&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) at 1 A g&#8722;1 and superior long&#8208;cycle property (90 mAh g&#8722;1 over 10&#160;000 cycles) at 10 A g&#8722;1, which is represented to be the best high&#8208;current density performance among all the organic electrode materials in dual&#8208;electrode available SAOBs. The Li+ storage mechanisms of three&#8208;motif molecular junction COFs are thoroughly scrutinized by experimental and theoretical identification, and the feasibility in practical application has been validated by a successfully assembled pouch cell.

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation in the first antimony&#8208;bridged all&#8208;inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polyoxoniobate framework exposes additional Li&#8208;binding sites and reduces the interlayer Li&#8208;ion diffusion barrier, resulting in a significant increase in capacity of Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Niobium oxides are considered as promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their excellent rate&#8208;performance. However, the practical application is hindered by their limited specific capacity. In this work, we report the first example of an all&#8208;inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobate framework as anode material for LIBs. The title compound is based on antimony&#8208;linked bivanadyl&#8208;capped &#945;&#8208;Keggin polyoxoniobates as secondary building units. The compound undergoes a unique single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation triggered by formic acid which results in the migration of a {VO} unit into the framework interlayer. This results in a 34% increase of the specific capacity, reaching 519&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1, thereby surpassing most Nb&#8208;based LIB anode materials. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the SCSC transformation exposes more Li&#8208;binding sites in the framework, and reduces the interlayer Li&#8208;ion diffusion barrier, leading to a capacity increase. This work presents the first example of a SCSC transformation leading to enhanced LIB performance and offers atomic&#8208;level insights into the design of advanced LIB anode materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,6&#8208;Dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), an enrichable and quantifiable cross&#8208;linker, offers the advantages of membrane permeability and biocompatibility. It enables one&#8208;step enrichment of cross&#8208;linked peptides via tandem mass tag (TMT) antibody, minimizing sample loss and enabling in vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) analysis of 1E4 cells. The isotope labeling feature of DPST ensures precise quantification in dynamic environments. With its flexible design supporting various isotope labeling configurations (6/10&#8208;plex), DPST holds significant promise for advancing biomedical research.








Abstract
In vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) enables the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein complexes in living cells. However, most XL&#8208;MS methods face significant sample loss during enrichment, limiting their applications to limited&#8208;quantity samples, and suffer from poor reproducibility (20%&#8211;40%), hindering precise quantification. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel membrane&#8208;permeable cross&#8208;linker, 2,6&#8208;dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), in which the dimethylpiperidinyl group enables one&#8208;step enrichment of cross&#8208;linked peptides via tandem mass tags (TMTs) antibody approach, eliminating sample loss from multi&#8208;step processes and allowing analysis from as few as 1E4 cells. DPST also allows the light and heavy isotopic labeling of cross&#8208;linked samples at the cellular level, which reduces inaccuracies from multi&#8208;step preparations. This generates reporter ions for precise MS2 quantification, improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio without increasing spectral complexity. Using DPST, we analyzed cross&#8208;links in primary neurons from single fetal mice and quantified the transient and weak interactions in dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) environments. Additionally, DPST's design supports multiple isotopic labeling configurations (e.g., 6&#8208;plex, 10&#8208;plex). Therefore, DPST provides a scalable and robust tool for in vivo XL&#8208;MS&#8208;based qualitative and quantitative analysis of living cells, even with limited sample quantities.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Coupled with Redox Center and Adsorption Site for Efficient Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalent organic frameworks incorporating both sulfur adsorption sites and ruthenium redox centers were successfully constructed as cathode materials for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The synergistic effect between the sulfur sites and ruthenium centers accelerates the adsorption and redox conversion of polyiodide species, thereby effectively mitigating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries exhibit significant potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage system, but the polyiodide shuttle effect severely impairs their performance and stability. Herein, a series of woven covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely COF&#8208;RuNCS&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;6), with pre&#8208;designed ruthenium(II) redox center and sulfur adsorption sites were constructed for shuttle&#8208;free cathode material in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The porous COF&#8208;RuNCS&#8208;X with abundant sulfur adsorption sites showed a selective adsorption of I3&#8722; species for effectively mitigating the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the incorporation of ruthenium(II) center into the COFs skeleton enhanced the redox kinetics of iodine species. Remarkably, COF&#8208;RuNCS&#8208;6 featuring the large pore size and high degree of conjugation demonstrated a discharge specific capacity as high as 395.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries and exhibited cycle stability up to 5000 cycles. This work provides a new understanding of the design of COF&#8208;based materials as efficient shuttle&#8208;free cathode materials for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering and Structural Modulation of RuO2&#8208;Based Catalysts for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobalt oxide (Co3O4) synergized nickel&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (Ni&#8208;RuO2) heterojunction was fabricated on a reduced graphene oxide surface (Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO). The Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO can achieve optimal OOH* adsorption and stabilize RuO2 for efficient and durable OER.








Abstract
Developing highly active and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions is key to commercializing green hydrogen production via water splitting. Here, we fabricated a cobalt oxide (Co3O4)&#8208;synergized nickel&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (Ni&#8208;RuO2) heterojunction on reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO) as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst in acidic electrolytes. The interface of Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2 heterojunction and doping of Ni into RuO2, as well as their effect on electronic structure, were examined by advanced characterizations. With only 1.36 wt% RuO2, the Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO heterojunction revealed an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 195 and 305&#160;mV at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst's performance was well maintained after operating for 100&#160;h at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, suggesting great promise for practical applications. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman analysis indicate that both the heterojunction structure and Ni doping play crucial roles in enhancing the OER activity and durability. This study provides a promising avenue for developing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability for advanced energy conversion.

         <title>Substrate Preorganization Within Photoactive Pt12L24 Nanospheres for Accelerated Decarboxylation Catalysis at Low Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate preorganization is used to overcome the concentration and lifetime constraints of photoredox catalysis. Pt12L24 nanospheres equipped with guanidinium moieties (LGua) are able to preorganize carboxylic acids and act as photocatalysts for the decarboxylative oxygenation reaction. Substrate preorganization accelerates the photochemical rate by two orders of magnitude, which allows efficient photoredox catalysis at 2 &#181;M concentrations.








Abstract
Photoredox catalysis with short&#8208;excited state lifetimes or in dilute conditions is challenging because the photochemical mechanism relies on collisions within the excited state of the photocatalyst. In this work, we use supramolecular substrate preorganization within Pt12L24 nanospheres as strategy to perform photoredox catalysis at low concentrations. We show that Pt12L24 nanospheres are efficient photocatalysts for the decarboxylative oxygenation reaction. Nanospheres with endo&#8208;functionalized guanidinium groups (Pt12LGua24) preorganize the substrate, which increases the catalytic turnover frequency by two orders of magnitude. Crucially, this preorganization ensures that Pt12LGua24 retains its photocatalytic activity at extremely low concentrations (2 &#181;M). This strategy thus overcomes the concentration limitations of photoredox catalysis and may be interesting for applications in dilute environments such as water purification and cellular photocatalysis.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Alkyne Semireduction by an Organic Photoreductant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic mimics of transition metals address compatibility challenges between metal catalysts and Lewis&#8208;basic motifs in drugs, which can deactivate catalysts and complicate metal removal. C&#9552;C bond reductions with metal hydrides are prone to poisoning but few organic reductants for Z&#8208;selective alkyne semireduction prevent both poisoning and overreduction. We report a Z&#8208;selective semireduction via EDA complexes that tolerate Lewis&#8208;basic and reducible motifs by selective preassociation.








Abstract
The semireduction of alkynes is an indispensable transformation for the synthesis of Z&#8208;alkenes. Although extensive studies with mostly transition metal&#8208;based catalysts have enabled it to produce a broad scope&#160;of alkenes, a SciFinderTM search and a robustness screen of Lindlar's catalyst indicate that highly Lewis&#8208;basic nitrogen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;containing motifs, which are prevalent in drugs, remain problematic. Herein, we report an alkyne semi&#8208;reduction using an organic photoreductant that tolerates all 10 of the most common Lewis&#8208;basic motifs in drugs. The reaction reduces terminal alkyl and aryl, dialkyl, alkyl aryl, and diaryl alkynes in high yields and Z&#8208;selectivities, while tolerating other reducible motifs like sulfones, nitriles, ketones, and electron&#8208;poor arenes. Ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration studies indicate that the reaction occurs by formation of a photoexcitable electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. Furthermore, a time study indicated that the reductant enforces a Z&#8208;selective reaction, which is unusual for alkyne reductions via electron transfer.

     alt="Z-Selective Alkyne Semireduction by an Organic Photoreductant"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic mimics of transition metals address compatibility challenges between metal catalysts and Lewis-basic motifs in drugs, which can deactivate catalysts and complicate metal removal. C&#9552;C bond reductions with metal hydrides are prone to poisoning but few organic reductants for &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective alkyne semireduction prevent both poisoning and overreduction. We report a &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective semireduction via EDA complexes that tolerate Lewis-basic and reducible motifs by selective preassociation.

         <title>Native Mass Spectrometry Facilitates Hit Validation in DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded Libraries (DEL) are increasingly used for small molecule drug discovery. While millions to billions of compounds can simultaneously be screened, the following validation of hits represents a major bottleneck. Native mass spectrometry now offers a speedy new way for in&#8208;depth characterization of hits on&#8208;DNA and delivers valuable information for follow&#8208;up medicinal chemical lead expansion.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded Library (DEL) Technology has become a workhorse of drug development, is widely employed in an industrial and academic setting, and an increasing number of drugs developed by DEL technology have entered clinical stage development. While up to billions of compounds can be screened simultaneously in affinity&#8208;based selections, the validation and characterization of individual hits discovered from DEL selections is a substantial bottleneck since it can be cumbersome and time&#8208;consuming. Here, we describe the use of native mass spectrometry for the speedy hit validation of On&#8208;DNA compounds. Through the preservation of noncovalent interactions in the gas phase, complexes of proteins and their respective On&#8208;DNA ligands can be analyzed without further need of labeling or immobilization. By utilizing the workflow described in this work, we were able to reliably rank affinities of various purified On&#8208;DNA binders or demonstrate binding of On&#8208;DNA compounds from unpurified mixtures, mitigating the need for tedious purification steps. Additionally, the methodology described here can offer valuable insight on which moiety of a binding molecule contributes the most to binding, facilitating subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts for lead expansion.

         <title>A Resonance Hybrid Design for Stable Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A resonance hybrid phenazine derivative (HSPC) is demonstrated for stable aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). By distributing redox centers across conjugated resonance forms, HSPC mitigates chemical degradation, achieving a low capacity decay (0.0009% per cycle, 0.006% per day) at 1.4 M electron concentration in AORFB applications. This work introduces a framework for designing durable organic energy storage materials through resonance hybridization, advancing sustainable battery technologies.








Abstract
Organic molecules are promising candidates for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) due to their structural versatility, tunability, and reliance on earth&#8208;abundant elements for sustainable energy storage solutions. However, achieving stability for organic molecules in aqueous batteries remains challenging due to water&#8208;induced degradation. The conjugated systems with enhanced rigidity, such as anthraquinone or phenazine derivatives, have shown improved stability, yet often exhibit unwanted restructuring reactions in the reduced state&#160;due to overly high electron densities, leading to the loss of redox activity. In the present work, we introduce a resonance hybrid, 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyl substituted phenazine dication (HSPC), whose redox center is distributed among different resonance forms between phenazine and quinone to enable efficient reversible electron transfer in aqueous environments. The electrochemical synthesis, resonance structure, and key properties of HSPC were investigated through a framework of combined electrochemical measurements, spectroscopic analysis, and theoretical studies. A 1.4&#160;M electron concentration cell based on HSPC exhibits a low capacity decay rate of 0.0009% per cycle, 0.006% per day. These results indicate the significant potential of the resonance hybrid design to build stable redox materials for AORFBs and other energy storage applications.

         <title>A Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptor with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Assistance Achieving Over 20% Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a nonfused ring electron acceptor, TT&#8208;TCBr, with high electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3. In organic solar cells (OSCs), the TT&#8208;TCBr&#8208;based binary device gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.20% with ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage and extremely low nonradiative energy loss. the TT&#8208;TCBr&#8208;based ternary OSC achieved an impressive PCE of 20.10%, representing one of best value among OSCs.








Abstract
The development of nonfused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with high electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) is essential for advancing the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs), due to their low&#8208;cost and minimal energy losses (Eloss). However, designing such NFREAs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a medium&#8208;bandgap NFREA, TT&#8208;TCBr, which exhibits a high EQEEL of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and an excellent electron mobility of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Interestingly, TT&#8208;TCBr shows enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield from solution (9.24%) to film (20.7%). In OSCs, the D18:TT&#8208;TCBr&#8208;based OSC achieves a good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.20% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V and a low nonradiative energy loss of 0.177&#160;eV. Importantly, TT&#8208;TCBr shows good miscibility with L8&#8208;BO, leading to an increased exciton diffusion length and EQEEL in the L8&#8208;BO: TT&#8208;TCBr blend. When TT&#8208;TCBr is introduced as a guest molecule into the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSC, Eloss is reduced from 0.543 to 0.530&#160;eV, resulting in a significantly increased PCE from 19.16% to 20.10%, which represents one of the highest PCEs reported for OSCs. This research will significantly contribute to the advancement of high&#8208;performance guest materials for the rapid development of single&#8208;junction OSCs.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Structural Ordering and Aluminum Redistribution During ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unraveled the structural and compositional evolution of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite during crystallization, decomposed the contributions of classical and non&#8208;classical routes, and traced the thermodynamic origin of Al&#8208;zoning through theoretical calculation&#8212;validated experimentally using the syngas&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction.








Abstract
Improving the comprehension of intricate crystallization processes at the molecular level is crucial for the customized design of efficient zeolite materials. However, the alternating dominance of classical and non&#8208;classical crystallization mechanisms, especially in multi&#8208;component solutions (monomers, oligomers, and amorphous particles), complicates mechanistic differentiation. Herein, we unveiled the structure and composition changes of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite at various stages via selectively removing soluble species from the synthesis solution. We revealed that highly ordered, aluminum&#8208;rich subcrystals serve as essential precursors, triggering rapid non&#8208;classical aggregation growth, followed by a ripening phase dominated by single&#8208;molecule addition. Notably, aluminum species are excluded from the aggregation growth process and reincorporated via monomer addition, accounting for the compositional heterogeneity and an aluminum&#8208;enriched surface of the final product. Remarkably, for the first time, the fact and reason behind the preferential formation of aluminum&#8208;rich nuclei, as well as the changes in Al species during the rapid growth and ripening stages have well been thoroughly verified and clarified through syngas to aromatics reaction and theoretical simulations. These findings provide valuable theoretical guidance for the directional synthesis of zeolite and the control of dynamic process variables.

         <title>Interfacial&#8208;Confined Oxygen Vacancy Clusters in ZrO2&#8208;Supported In2O3&#8208;x Catalysts Boost Methanol Production From CO2</title>

         <dc:description>
Synergizing the quantum size effect for enhanced In2O3 reducibility with strong In&#8211;O&#8211;Zr interfacial confine for high stability enables the creation of enriched large&#8208;size VO clusters (e.g., trimers, tetramers, and larger) on ZrO2&#8208;supported monolayer In2O3&#8208;x nano&#8208;islands without overreduction to metallic indium. This boosts a higher intrinsic activity for methanol production than that of bulk In2O3 with single VO sites in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (VO) play a vital role in catalytic reactions. Tuning the VO structures beyond its density is of great significance for optimizing catalytic performance, but remains challenging due to uncontrolled reduction and its poor stability under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the integration of quantum size effect for enhanced In2O3 reducibility with strong In&#8211;O&#8211;Zr interfacial confinement for high stability enables the creation of stable large&#8208;size VO clusters (e.g., trimers, tetramers, and larger) on ZrO2&#8208;supported monolayer In2O3&#8208;x nano&#8208;islands with high density without overreduction to metallic indium. In the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, the ZrO2&#8208;supported monolayer In2O3&#8208;x catalyst with VO clusters exhibits a considerably higher intrinsic activity for methanol production than that of bulk In2O3 with single VO sites. Further addition of Pd onto these monolayer In2O3&#8208;x with enriched VO clusters allows achieving an unprecedentedly high methanol space&#8208;time yield of 46.6 mmolMeOH&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 270&#160;&#176;C along with long&#8208;term stability for at least 200&#160;h, surpassing all In2O3&#8208;based catalysts reported to date.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Activated Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Site Catalysts Break Adsorption&#8208;Energy Scaling Relations for Robust Bifunctional Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of boron&#8208;mediated single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalyst has been explored by coupling metal&#8211;carbon coordination with additional boron doping. Atomically&#8208;dispersed CoC4B&#7530; moieties were identified as unique bifunctional active center that breaks the usual scaling relations to implement an almost impossible mission of boosting inherent OER and ORR activities simultaneously beyond the theoretical limit for single metal site in a single catalyst.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalysts are paramount to many renewable energy technologies. Atomically&#8208;dispersed transition&#8208;metal catalysts are compelling alternatives to current dominant noble&#8208;metal catalysts, yet they often show inadequate activity for OER and insufficient durability in practical battery operations. Here, we show a rational methodology that enables single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalyst to break universal adsorption&#8208;energy scaling limitations for both OER/ORR and push bifunctional catalytic performance of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dominated catalysts to unprecedented level. Other than metal&#8211;nitrogen coordination, the newly&#8208;designed catalyst (namely metal&#8208;C&#8208;B) stabilizes atomic metals on B&#8208;doped carbon via metal&#8211;carbon coordination and afford favorable electronic engineering. The optimized Co&#8208;C&#8208;B catalyst in base exhibits a record&#8208;low OER overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a superior ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V with robust stability over 500 h of continuous OER or ORR, which endows a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery with over 6755 charge/discharge cycles. The delivered mass activities of 33941&#160;A&#160;gmetal&#8722;1 for OER and 15873 A gmetal&#8722;1 for ORR are respectively &#8764;112/80&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial noble&#8208;metal counterparts. Atomically&#8208;dispersed CoC4B&#7530; moieties were theoretically identified as unique bifunctional active centers, breaking usual scaling relations of intermediates adsorption and boosting inherent OER/ORR activities simultaneously beyond theoretical limitations for single metal site.

         <title>Promoting the rate performances of weakly solvating electrolyte&#8208;based lithium&#8210;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg&#8722;1. Employing weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) effectively alleviates the polysulfide shuttle effect and improves the cycling lifespan. However, the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE is highly sluggish to render degraded rate performances. Herein, the sulfur cathode kinetics of WSE&#8208;based Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically investigated to help promote the rate performances in practical pouch cells. Concretely, the sluggish cathode kinetics of the previous charging process is identified as the main limitation for specific discharge capacity loss at high rates. Further polarization decoupling manifests activation polarization corresponding to polysulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur constitutes the dominant kinetic challenge. Accordingly, a redox mediation strategy is proposed to accelerate the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics of polysulfide oxidation in WSE. 3 Ah&#8208;level pouch cells cycle stably under a high rate of 0.2 C, and 5 Ah&#8208;level pouch cells achieve an actual energy density of 470 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work deepens the comprehension of the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE and highlights the redox mediation strategy in achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;rate Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Circumventing Scaling Relations via Gradient Orbital Coupling Promotes Ammonia Electrosynthesis on Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH3) relies on the balanced activation of various substrates including nitrate and water, but is currently hindered by the inherent scaling relations governing the adsorption of key reaction intermediates, such as *NO and *H. Herein, we develop a strategy to circumvent these limitations by introducing f&#8208;d&#8208;p gradient orbital coupling in cobalt oxide (Co3O4) through Ce doping. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the lattice strain triggered by the dopant redistributes electron density at the Co and O sites, thereby modulating the adsorption strengths of *NO and *H, which favors the production of NH3 while suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction. It exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8% and a high yield rate of 3423.0 &#181;g h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, Ce/Co3O4 catalyst shows robust performance over a wide range of nitrate concentrations (from 5 mM to 200 mM) and excellent cycling stability. Our findings also suggest that the gradient orbital coupling approach can be extended to other lanthanide dopants (e.g., Pr and Nd), offering a broadly applicable platform to break scaling relations and improve NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 activity on cobalt catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Direct Levulinate Hydrodeoxygenation to Pentanoic Biofuels over La&#8208;Modulated Ru&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disentangling the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates has been a great challenge in biomass valorization and related tandem catalysis, by virtue of involving a series of reactions in parallel and in cascade. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of La modulation for Ru&#8208;zeolite combinations in the case of direct HDO of neat ethyl levulinate (EL) into ethyl pentanoate (EP). An unprecedented EP yield of 80% and an EP turnover rate (TOR) of 224 molEP&#8729;molRu&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1, together with excellent stability, were obtained for the optimal Ru/2.8La&#8208;Y catalyst for the first time, compared to the current reported &#8220;performance ceiling&#8221; of EP yields of &lt;40% and EP TORs of &lt;120 molEP&#8729;molmetal&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1 under similar conditions. Optimal La modulation could maximize the density of the active Br&#248;nsted acid sites and efficiently attenuate the acid strength, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity in the direct HDO of EL into EP while suppressing the further hydrolysis reactions that consume EP. This study provides an effective approach to regulate the acid properties of metal/zeolite bifunctional catalysts, in particular in mediation of compromise in acid density and acid strength factors, for breaking the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in biomass valorization and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Photoacoustic Imaging of Mobile Cu(II) in Vivo via Catalytic Radical Cation Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper dyshomeostasis is associated with various diseases, making in vivo spatiotemporal imaging of mobile Cu(II) dynamics crucial for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms. However, imaging mobile Cu(II) dynamics remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the limitations of conventional probes in distinguishing between mobile and bound Cu(II). Herein, we developed a design strategy based on catalytic arylamine radical cation formation, enabling the creation of photoacoustic probes with superior sensitivity and micron&#8208;resolution imaging capabilities in the short&#8208;wave infrared region, specifically in response to mobile Cu(II). In vivo imaging of the brains of Parkinson's disease model mice revealed significant alternations in mobile Cu(II) levels within the cerebral cortex and cerebellar lobules during early disease stages, suggesting that these regions are particularly vulnerable to Cu(II) accumulation in early Parkinson's disease. These findings underscore the significant potential of these probes for investigating mobile Cu(II) dynamics and their role in physiological and pathological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bidirectional Ion Kinetic Regulator Suppressing Lithium Dendrites in Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid organic electrolytes (LOEs) are of crucial significance in secondary battery deposition processes. Based on Sand's time formula, this study proposes a novel bidirectional ion kinetic regulator concept. Verified in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), it is demonstrated that regulating the migration of anions and cations simultaneously can effectively promote the realization of dendrite&#8208;free batteries. This bidirectional ion kinetic regulator forms octahedral complexes with TFSI&#8208;, decreasing TFSI&#8208; migration, enhancing Li+ desolvation and diffusion, and thus extending the dendrite formation time by over 25 times. Moreover, the attraction of the regulator towards solvent molecules and its improvement on the sulfur reduction kinetics effectively suppress the shuttle effect. Subsequently, the assembled Li||Li (1 mA cm&#8208;2 for 2000 h), Li&#8208;Cu (99.4% of CE), and Li&#8208;S (1000 cycle at 4 C) cells deliver extremely excellent cycling stability. An Ah&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cells also exhibit negligible capacity decay (50 cycles without capacity decay). This confirms the importance of regulating both anions and cations for high&#8208;safety LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular CO2 Capture Triggered Outperforming Biocatalytic Production of Selective Acetic Acid &amp; Biohydrogen Housing in Porous&#8208;Organic&#8208;Nanofiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a novel electrofermentation platform integrating polycarbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer (VJ&#8208;POP) coated electrodes to enhance selective Acetic acid (AA) biosynthesis by Bacillus subtilis. Impressive high surface area and tailored porosity facilitate efficient CO2 capture, modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes, and improve electron transfer, thereby driving product specificity. In the bioreactor equipped with VJ&#8208;POP, AA production reached 2.11 g/L with a yield of 0.48 g/g, achieving 71% of the theoretical maximum without genetic modifications. The process also resulted in enriched biohydrogen content (52%) in the biogas (H2+CO2) composition, highlighting the synergistic effect of VJ&#8208;POP on CO2 sequestration and microbial metabolism. Gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of ackA (acetate kinase) and pdhA (pyruvate dehydrogenase), while buk (butyrate kinase) was downregulated, ensuring metabolic selectivity toward AA. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis unambiguously confirmed an interesting phenomenon of enhanced electron transfer and reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance in VJ&#8208;POP&#8208;assisted systems. This pioneering approach with unique investigation results presents a scalable and sustainable biocatalytic framework for CO2 valorization, bridging material science and microbial electrochemical systems for selective AA and enhanced biohydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Conventional Doping: Sulfur&#8208;Induced Electronic and Interfacial Dynamics for Advanced Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) offers a sustainable route for NH3 synthesis and environmental remediation, yet it is hindered by sluggish kinetics due to inefficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and inadequate electrocatalyst design. Conventional approaches primarily focus on regulating the bulk electronic modulation of the electrocatalyst while neglecting interfacial water dynamics. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;functional sulfur doping strategy in Co3O4 (S&#8208;Co3O4) to simultaneously enhance bulk conductivity and optimize interfacial proton transfer. Through innovative benzene sulfonyl chloride blocking experiment, in situ spectroscopic analyses, and kinetic isotope effect studies, we reveal that sulfur doping narrows the band&#8208;gap of Co3O4 to enhance bulk charge transport while disrupting rigid hydrogen&#8208;bond network of water in the electric double layer, the weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded H2O reduces the dissociation barrier and facilitates proton supply for nitrate hydrogenation. The proposed &#8220;electronic&#8208;interfacial synergy&#8221; strategy establishes a transformative paradigm for designing electrocatalysts in PCET&#8208;driven reactions, advancing sustainable energy conversion and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Carbon Monoxide Reduction Reaction on Cu(111) from Operando Electrochemical X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we introduce a modified dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ECXPS) approach that offers new mechanistic insight into the alkaline carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) over a Cu(111) single crystal surface. We tackle two major unresolved questions in the CORR mechanism that persist in the literature. Firstly, we address the mechanism for methane formation on Cu(111) and show that the mechanism likely proceeds via atomic carbon, which subsequently couples, leading to the accumulation of amorphous carbon on the surface. Secondly, we provide insight into whether the mechanism for acetate formation occurs entirely on the surface or partially within the solution phase, showing that acetate is present on the surface, indicating a surface&#8208;based reaction. These insights into surface&#8208;based mechanisms provide a handle for designing future catalysts that can efficiently target the binding of specific intermediates. Furthermore, we expect that our modified approach to dip&#8208;and&#8208;pull ECXPS &#8208; in which we have changed the electrode geometry, the method of introducing the reactant gas, and used hard x&#8208;rays &#8208; will significantly expand the technique&#8217;s applicability, enabling studies of the CO(2)RR and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Ammonia Formation Catalyzed by Molybdenum and Samarium Complexes</title>

         <title>Bypassing In Situ CO Poisoning in Furfural Conversion: Electron&#8208;deficient Pd Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Enable One&#8208;Step Selective Synthesis of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The one&#8208;step conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfural (FUR) to tetrahydrofuran (THF) via combining decarbonylation and hydrogenation offers a sustainable alternative to the industrial Reppe process, while the selectivity control remains a significant challenge. Herein, we identify carbon monoxide (CO), in situ generated during FUR decarbonylation, as a major hindrance, significantly inhibiting subsequent furan hydrogenation. To overcome this limitation, a zeolite&#8208;encapsulated Pt1Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst, namely Pt10Pd90@S&#8208;1, is designed, which effectively mitigates CO poisoning and enables efficient FUR conversion to THF, achieving 100% FUR conversion and &gt;93% THF selectivity with good long&#8208;term stability (~100 h)&#8212;among the highest values reported to date. Mechanistic studies reveal that electron&#8208;deficient Pd species adjacent to single Pt atoms in Pt10Pd90@S&#8208;1 significantly enhance H2 activation and furan adsorption, enabling efficient hydrogenation at both the C&#945; and C&#946; positions of furan despite CO poisoning. Furthermore, the one&#8208;step process is economically viable with a minimum selling price (MSP) of $1701 per tonne of THF, and a life cycle assessment shows a CO2 equivalent emission of 1.29&#160;tonnes per tonne of THF&#8212;less than 25% of that of the traditional Reppe process. This work represents a transformative advancement in sustainable THF production, with the potential to revolutionize industrial THF production.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;State and Clustering Effects in Fe&#8208;Complex Negolytes for Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective redox&#8208;active materials are essential for advancing redox flow batteries (RFBs). Iron, with its abundance and suitability as a redox couple, is a promising candidate; however, achieving stable and fast redox reactions in aqueous RFBs remains a challenge. This study presents an Fe&#8208;based negolyte stabilized by a hexadentate ligand, where Fe&#8211;ligand bonds are enhanced through intermolecular interactions. The sulfonate&#8208;substituted Fe complex exhibits a formal potential of &#8211;0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl and an exceptionally high rate constant of 0.69&#160;cm s&#8211;1. Near&#8208;neutral RFBs incorporating 0.5 M Fe complex show excellent cycling stability, with no discernable capacity fading over 300 cycles. This performance is attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bonds that reinforce Fe&#8211;ligand coordination and promote the formation of stable trimeric clusters. Operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory reveal that &#960;&#8208;backdonation from Fe(II) to the imino&#8208;phenolate moiety further stabilizes the complex after reduction. In contrast, the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted complex exhibits inferior stability due to weaker hydrogen bonding and less pronounced &#960;&#8208;backdonation. These findings underscore the importance of ligand design and intermolecular interactions in developing cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active materials for aqueous RFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Highly Efficient Luminescence and Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption Character in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#160;Emitters Based on a Tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of multi&#8208;photon absorption phenomenon (MPA) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials opens new avenues for bio&#8208;optoelectronic applications. However, the development of TADF emitters that simultaneously exhibit triplet harvesting and MPA is hindered by the challenge of balancing molecular planarity, reduced orbital overlap, and large oscillator strength. In this study, we demonstrate a quadrupolar molecular design based on the tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) to accomplish efficient MPA and TADF performance. Two new TADF emitters, TBPZ2TPA and TBPZ2NP were synthesized, featuring an electron&#8208;accepting TBPZ core and electron&#8208;donating triarylamine (TAA) units to achieve an optimal balance between TADF and MPA characteristics. Particularly, TBPZ2TPA blended film exhibits orange&#8208;red emission with a maximum at 589 nm, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#1060;PL) of 71%, a sufficiently small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.16 eV and reversed intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.3 x 104 s&#8208;1. Furthermore, it demonstrated a remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) of 892 GM at 780 nm and an excellent 2PA brightness of 785 GM, along with evident three&#8208;photon absorption (3PA) at 1200 nm. These results provide a compelling strategy for developing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional MPA properties, enabling dual functionality for both OLEDs and high&#8208;resolution bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity Spatio&#8208;Temporal Cholesterol Detection by Quadrature Phase&#8208;Shifted Polarization Stimulated Raman Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing cholesterol dynamics in living systems in situ remains a fundamental challenge in biomedical imaging. While fluorescence microscopy requires bulky tags that perturb small molecule behavior, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy enables label&#8208;free detection of CH&#8208;rich molecules. However, conventional SRS probes only polarized Raman components, limiting molecular specificity by seemingly overlapped peaks. Here, we extend SRS microscopy to achieve rapid, comprehensive detection of Raman tensor through quadrature phase&#8208;shifted polarization SRS (QP&#178;&#8208;SRS) microscopy. This technique exploits the underlying molecular signatures by detecting both polarized and depolarized components of third&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility &#160;that originates from molecular structural features. We adopt a specialized optical delay line that rapidly alternates between parallel&#8208; and perpendicular&#8208;polarization states. QP&#178;&#8208;SRS enables unprecedented distinction of similar molecular species in complex mixtures, demonstrating approximately 10&#215; enhancement in chemical specificity and 5&#215; improvement in analytical accuracy. This enhanced sensitivity enables real&#8208;time monitoring of lipid dynamics in living C. elegans and reveals component heterogeneity and morphological changes of LD in NAFLD livers. QP&#178;&#8208;SRS creates new opportunities for investigating cholesterol&#8208;dependent biological processes in their native environment, with broad potential for chemical imaging with enhanced molecular specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Isomerically Diverse Ginsenosides Using Engineered Aerolysin Nanopore via Non&#8208;Translocation Blockade Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typical nanopore sensing depends on slowed translocation through the pore to acquire effective blockade signals. However, this paradigm often suffers from low signal precision and poor resolution, making it challenging to resolve pools of analytes with diverse, similar structures. Here we present a non&#8208;translocation blockade sensing based on an engineered aerolysin S278K that enables the identification of isomerically diverse ginsenosides&#8212;a class of glycoconjugates whose structural characterization has been a persistent challenge in glycoscience. By introducing the S278K mutation, the aerolysin acquires a highly positively charged interior and generates intense electro&#8208;osmotic flow and enhanced steric/enthalpic barriers, effectively trapping ginsenoside molecules in the K278&#8208;R220 region and preventing their further translocation. This distinct blockade sensing mode significantly improves the detection capability of aerolysin by prolonging residence time (e.g., 43&#8208;fold longer), enabling detailed molecular characterization. As a result, we demonstrate the unambiguous identification of 30 ginsenosides differing in glycosyl composition, isomerism, modification, and aglycone, as well as the quantitative analysis of complex ginsenosides in real samples by integrating deep learning. This work underscores the promise of non&#8208;translocation nanopore sensing for deciphering structurally complex and diverse small molecule analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Bonds at Tin(II): Reductive or Oxidative Addition?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, the addition of H&#8211;H, Be&#8211;Be, B&#8211;B, and B&#8211;H bonds to SnII is studied by experimental and theoretical means. We report the first examples of B&#8211;B and Be&#8211;Be bond additions to a main group metal centre, along with the first example of borazine B&#8211;H bond addition to any element of the Periodic Table. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the classification of these reactions as prototypical &#8216;oxidative&#8217; addition processes may be misleading, and that a more nuanced description is warranted.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic &#945;&#8208;Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange of Benzylic Alcohols by Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange (HDE) has emerged as a valuable tool for achieving site&#8208;selective deuteration and the precision labelling of bioactive molecules. Incorporation of deuterium at metabolically labile positions, enabled by such methods, can potentially improve drug efficacy through the kinetic isotope effect. However, achieving precise, site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium at specific molecular positions remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly efficient &#945;&#8208;site&#8208;selective HDE of benzylic alcohols via a palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). By using the Pd SAC, exceptional activity and selectivity in HDE reactions were achieved, delivering up to 95% deuterium incorporation (D&#8208;inc.) at the &#945;&#8208;position while effectively suppressing undesired pathways (e.g., &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration). Mechanistic investigations reveal that the Pd SAC promotes site selective HDE through two distinct surface pathways: (i) a previously unreported direct C&#8211;H bond activation and (ii) a modified borrowing hydrogen process in which high&#8208;pressure hydrogen inhibits the keto enol tautomerization, thereby largely circumvents &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration. The catalyst exhibits robust stability, reusability, and broad substrate compatibility, underscoring its potential for practical applications. This work marks a significant advance in heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalytic methodologies for site&#8208;selective deuteration, offering a complementary solution to longstanding challenges in catalytic organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>From Amino Acids to &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids via &#946;&#8208;Elimination and Transamination Initiates a Pathway to Prebiotic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction starting from two amino acids, phosphoserine and Gly, reveals a pathway to the &#945;&#8208;keto acid building blocks pyruvate and glyoxylate, key components of a plausible early metabolic system. A one&#8208;pot &#946;&#8208;elimination and transamination sequence also initiates a cascade of protometabolic transformations that provide crucial insights into the emergence of early metabolic networks in aqueous environments. 








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Keto acids, such as pyruvate and glyoxylate, may have been critical in generating reaction networks at the origins of life due to their facile carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation and their hydrolytic stability. However, demonstrated prebiotic sources of these small &#945;&#8208;keto acids have been limited by conditions required for their production, which are not conducive for subsequent incorporation or transition into (proto)metabolic pathways. Here, we demonstrate an abiotic generation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids from only two amino acids, starting with the phosphorylation and dehydration of serine (Ser) coupled with a transamination with glycine (Gly), to produce both pyruvate and glyoxylate. This triggers an in situ reaction pathway producing higher&#8208;order &#945;&#8208;keto acids, including amino acid precursors found in modern biology. These findings may help elucidate how protometabolic chemical networks can emerge on the early Earth under mild aqueous conditions, leading to a coupled amino acid&#8212;&#945;&#8208;keto acid chemical system capable of supporting a more robust metabolism.

         <title>Large N&#8208;Doped Zigzag Hydrocarbon Belts from Calixarenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zigzag molecular nanobelts inlaid with nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups around portals were synthesized from calix[8]arenes. The synthesis features one&#8208;pot multiple intermolecular fjord&#8208;stitching C&#9472;N bond cross&#8208;coupling reactions and selective methylene oxidation reactions. The belt molecules adopt an octagonal prism shape of a large cavity, and are capable of complexing C60 or C70.








Abstract
Zigzag hydrocarbon belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have captivated chemists because of their unique structures, tantalizing properties, and potential applications. Despite synthetic breakthroughs, the diversity, especially, the size of belts synthesized by fjord&#8208;stitching approach is limited by resorcin[n]arenes (n&#160;=&#160;4, 6). We report herein the synthesis, structure and properties of large belts starting from conventional calix[8]arenes. The synthesis features multiple C&#9472;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions of per&#8208;brominated calix[8]arenes with anilines and ammonia, and selective transformation of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline into quinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one segments. The molecules in question adopt a unique zigzag belt structure with nitrogen atoms and functional groups located around both portals, yielding a large octagonal prism cavity. They are able to accommodate fullerene C60 or C70 with high affinity driven by lone&#8208;pair electron/&#960; interactions and steric complementarity between host and guest.

         <title>Unlocking Durable and Sustainable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries via Molecularly Engineered Polyiodide Reservoirs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable &#8220;polyiodide reservoir&#8221;, engineered by the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities within covalent organic cages, is proposed as the iodine host. The resulting zinc&#8211;iodine battery demonstrates a capacity retention of 90.1% after 4000 cycles at 5 C and maintains 85.4% of its initial capacity after three reuse cycles.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for safe and sustainable energy storage but are hindered by polyiodide shuttling, leading to rapid capacity decay and limited cyclability. In this work, we propose a &#8220;polyiodide reservoirs&#8221; concept, utilizing iodophilic covalent organic cages to confine polyiodide through multiple noncovalent interactions. By precisely engineering the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities around 3D cavities, these cages evolve from open to near&#8208;enclosed structure, achieving molecular&#8208;level polyiodide entrapment. The optimized superphane cage (18 N&#8208;active sites) enables a ZIB with 90.1% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 5 C, even under extreme conditions (58.9 wt% iodine content within the cage and an iodine area loading of 3.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 in the cathode). Importantly, the cage's solubility&#8208;driven regeneration capability retains 85.4% initial capacity over three reuse cycles. This work establishes covalent organic superphanes as a transformative platform for long&#8208;life ZIBs, offering a dual solution to shuttle suppression and electrode sustainability through structural confinement and dynamic recyclability.

         <title>Complementary Hydrogen&#9472;Bonded Functionalized Mixed Conducting Terpolymers for High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;type Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Healable Inverters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic incorporation of dynamic hydrogen bonds into the conjugated backbone of the terpolymer enhances mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting performance, originating from the unique microstructure that synergistically enhances electron mobility and volume capacitance, thereby achieving high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors and self&#8208;healing, high&#8208;gain inverters. These novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymeric mixed conductors pave the way for the advancement of next&#8208;generation flexible bioelectronic devices.








Abstract
High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), crucial for integrated circuits in wearable bioelectronics, demand organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs) that exhibit efficient mixed conduction and biological functionality for practical applications. However, the development of self&#8208;healing OMIECs has not yet been achieved due to the lack of suitable synthetic strategies. Here, we present a design concept through incorporating dynamic cross&#8208;linked hydrogen&#8208;bonded in the polymer backbone for the first demonstration of self&#8208;healing polymeric mixed conductors, enabling high&#8208;performing OECTs and high gain, self&#8208;healing inverters.

&lt;p&gt;The strategic incorporation of dynamic hydrogen bonds into the conjugated backbone of the terpolymer enhances mixed ionic-electronic conducting performance, originating from the unique microstructure that synergistically enhances electron mobility and volume capacitance, thereby achieving high-performing n-type organic electrochemical transistors and self-healing, high-gain inverters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performing n-type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), crucial for integrated circuits in wearable bioelectronics, demand organic mixed ion-electron conductors (OMIECs) that exhibit efficient mixed conduction and biological functionality for practical applications. However, the development of self-healing OMIECs has not yet been achieved due to the lack of suitable synthetic strategies. Here, we present a design concept through incorporating dynamic cross-linked hydrogen-bonded in the polymer backbone for the first demonstration of self-healing polymeric mixed conductors, enabling high-performing OECTs and high gain, self-healing inverters. These devices exhibit a mixed conducting figure of merit &lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;C* of 118 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, three times higher than the copolymer without hydrogen bond, along with simultaneously improved volumetric capacitance and electron mobility. These improvements are attributed to the unique microstructure created by hydrogen bond, which results in a closer &#960;-&#960; stacking distance within smaller crystalline domain sizes. Additionally, a cost-effective post-processing side chain removal method is proposed, which retains high performance in n-type OECTs. Remarkably, inverters based on the hydrogen-bonded terpolymer demonstrate high gain and self-healing capabilities through solvent vapor exposure and annealing treatment.

         <title>Anomalous pH&#8208;Dependence of Ru for Hydrogen Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dichotomy between the &#8220;canonical&#8221; (Pt) and &#8220;anomalous&#8221; (Ru) pH responses in hydrogen electrochemistry challenges the universality of existing theoretical systems. By decoding the anomalous pH dependence of Ru, this work provides chances to resolve current theoretical limitations in complex interfacial processes, contributing to a unified physical model for understanding hydrogen electrocatalysis.








Abstract
The essence of the classic pH&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Pt toward hydrogen electrochemistry has been debated for decades. In stark contrast, Ru represents a unique exception by exhibiting intrinsically anomalous pH dependence among Pt&#8208;group metals, significantly challenging the universal validity of the existing mechanistic system derived from classic pH effects. To decode the chemical essence beneath the unique anomalous pH dependence, refined multidimensional structural characterizations and electrical transport spectroscopic studies reveal that the electron delocalization on Ru surface enables strong oxophilicity and unique pH&#8208;dependent coverage of OH*, essentially different from the H*&#8208;dominated Pt surface. The enriched OH* breaks the classic pH&#8208;dependent rule by forming hydrogen bond&#8208;regulated interfacial water structures, thus creating a unique chemical environment for alkaline hydrogen catalysis. By clearly decoding the anomalous pH&#8208;dependent behavior of Ru, our work provides new chances to improve the physicochemical model for re&#8208;understanding hydrogen electrochemistry.

         <title>Selective Production of Acetylene from the C&#9472;C Coupling Reaction of CH4 with CO2 Mediated by Ta2O2+ Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling reaction between CH4 and CO2 to selectively produce the C2 hydrocarbon of C2H2 has been successfully realized at room temperature mediated by the active Ta2O2+ cluster. The prereaction of Ta2O2+ with CH4 evokes an in situ reconstruction of Ta&#9472;O&#9472;Ta to Ta&#9472;CCH4&#9472;Ta, which serves as the actual reactive site to delicately control the sequential elementary reactions targeted for H&#9472;CCH4&#8801;CCO2&#9472;H generation.








Abstract
Coconversion of methane and carbon dioxide to C2 hydrocarbons via the CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling reaction is of great significance to mitigate greenhouse effect and develop an alternative route for manufacture of important industrial feedstocks (e.g., C2H2), however, it has not yet been achieved so far owing to the difficulty in breaking both of the C&#9552;O bonds in CO2 as well as the precise control of sequential elementary reactions targeted for C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, by using the tantalum oxide Ta2O2+ as an active cluster, an unprecedented CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling reaction of CH4 with CO2 to exclusively produce the C2 hydrocarbon of C2H2 has been successfully realized even at room temperature by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass spectrometry. The in situ reconstruction from Ta&#9472;O&#9472;Ta cluster skeleton to tantalum carbide Ta&#9472;C&#9472;Ta experienced upon the prereaction with CH4 is critical to delicately control the sequential elementary reactions targeted for C2H2 generation. This finding not only leads to a breakthrough in the field of gas&#8208;phase and condensed&#8208;phase chemistry wherein the C2+ oxygenated compounds were the mainstream products for CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling of CH4 with CO2, but also explores a new active structure and a novel reaction mechanism beneficial for selective production of C2 hydrocarbons from coconversion of CH4 and CO2.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive DNA Droplets for Controlling Enzyme Cascade Pathways by Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;motif sequences with azobenzene&#8208;modified sticky ends (SE) were designed to form Azo&#8208;DNA droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. These droplets enable selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments, allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) light stimuli. 








Abstract
Precise control of enzymatic cascade pathways is essential for deepening our understanding of metabolic processes and designing synthetic biochemical systems. In this study, we present a novel approach to modulate these cascades using light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets. Y&#8208;motif sequences with azobenzene&#8208;modified sticky ends (SE) were designed to form DNA droplets via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. These droplets enable selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments, allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet (UV) and visible (vis) light stimuli. As a model system, we employed an incompatible enzymatic cascade, involving glucose oxidase (GOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and catalase (CAT). Under visible light, the DNA droplets co&#8208;localize enzymes within the compartments, effectively regulating metabolic flux without altering the total enzyme concentration. Upon UV exposure, the droplets disassemble, releasing the sequestered enzymes and altering cascade dynamics. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated using an alternative enzymatic cascade system comprising galactose oxidase (GAO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and CAT. This system demonstrates that light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets are a powerful tool for regulating enzymatic pathways, with potential applications in synthetic biology, microreactor design, and bioengineering.

         <title>Molecularly Woven Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly woven artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was constructed by coating woven polymer crystals onto the Li metal anode. The mechanical stability of these woven polymer crystals, combined with their intrinsic Li&#8208;ion channels, enables the resulting lithium&#8208;metal batteries to be dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems, but they suffer from destructive dendrite growth. Here, we integrate cutting&#8208;edge molecular weaving technology into the fabrication of artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEI) to realize dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lasting LMBs. Specifically, weaving polymer chains into a 2D plane endows polymer network crystals with high strength and elasticity and creates angstrom&#8208;level meshes for Li&#8208;ion transport and uniform deposition. As a result, related Li plating experiments remained stable at an unprecedentedly high current density of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, full cells with &#8220;woven&#8221; ASEI exhibited superior long&#8208;term cycling performance compared to existing 2D materials, achieving a capacity retention of 98% over 270 cycles under stringent testing conditions.

&#8220;Electricity&#8221; plays a pivotal role in efficiently converting solar energy into fuels. This review proposes a dual&#8208;path framework for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion: cross&#8208;space charge transport systems (external/self&#8208;powered driving forces) and local electric field regulation systems (static intrinsic/dynamic fields), elucidating their roles in bridging light absorption and fuel synthesis through distinct electricity&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms.








Abstract
Efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels is pivotal for establishing sustainable energy systems, yet persistent challenges in carrier dynamics and reaction selectivity hinder practical implementation. This review systematically examines the emerging paradigm of &#8220;electricity&#8221; assisted solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel catalysis, innovatively proposing a dual&#8208;path framework based on distinct electrical intervention mechanisms: Cross&#8208;Space Charge Transfer System and Local Electric Field Regulation System, elucidating their unique roles in bridging light absorption and fuel synthesis. In the former, the charge transfer driven by external bias enhances the separation of photogenerated charges in single photoelectrode photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), while the self&#8208;powered dual photoelectrodes PEC&#8208;PEC, photovoltaic&#8208;photoelectrocatalysis (PV&#8208;PEC), and photovoltaic&#8208;electrocatalysis (PV&#8208;EC) systems achieve zero energy conversion from solar energy to fuel through band matching and device integration, utilizing charge transfer driven by photogenerated potential. In the latter, static intrinsic electric field (ferroelectric spontaneous polarization electric field and interface electric field) and dynamic electric field (piezoelectric, pyroelectric, flexoelectric, and triboelectric induced transient electric field) optimize carrier transport dynamics and accelerate reactant adsorption. This article systematically summarizes the promotion of diverse forms of &#8220;electricity&#8221; on solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel catalysis, reveals the energy conversion mechanisms, material design principles, performance bottlenecks, and solutions of different systems, providing insights into the development of this field.

         <title>Incorporation of Dye&#8208;Derived Carbon Dots Into Carbon Nitride Nanosheets for Enhanced Photoindcued Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NCD@CN heterojunctions, which integrated dye&#8208;derived carbon dots into nitrogen&#8208;deficient carbon nitride nanosheets, not only preserved an ultrafast reaction rate for photo&#8208;ATRP and produced well&#8208;structured polymers with narrow dispersity but also facilitated easy separation and effective recyclability in cascade polymerizations.








Abstract
Carbon dots have made significant advancements in photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo&#8208;ATRP), achieving ultrafast reaction rates and precise control over the resulting polymers. However, their ultrasmall size necessitates time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive purification steps, which can ultimately lead to undesirable product contamination. In this study, we integrated dye&#8208;derived carbon dots (NCD) into nitrogen&#8208;deficient carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets via a hydrothermal process, forming NCD@CN heterojunctions with an expanded delocalized heterocyclic structure, enhanced specific surface area, and improved light absorption. The chemical linkages between the two components created NCD@CN heterojunctions, which improved interfacial interactions and promoted efficient charge transfer. The NCD@CN heterojunctions demonstrated ultrahigh activity, comparable to the NCD precursors, achieving a turnover number up to 1780 and a turnover frequency up to 59.3&#160;min&#8722;1. This led to the production of polymers with tailor&#8208;made structures, predicted molecular weights, and narrow dispersities. Additionally, they enabled complete catalyst recovery across multiple polymerization cycles. The incorporation of NCD into CN nanosheets affords new territory for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts at the atomic level and provides alternative pathways for ultrafast photo&#8208;ATRP processes.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Hierarchically Self&#8208;Assembled Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Gels for Guest Segregation and Electrical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase separation of self&#8208;assembled hosts in a gel from liquid guests is a convenient approach for heterogeneous encapsulation. In their Communication (e202504207), Dong Yang and co&#8208;workers report a class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates, which can be utilized as filling material in columns and show the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization.

         <title>Conformational Change in a Four&#8208;Tetrad DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex upon Intercalation of a Small&#8208;Molecule Ligand PyDH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exception or the rule? This work represents a second observation, and the first crystallographic evidence, of true intercalation of a small&#8208;molecule ligand (here, bisquinolinium PyDH2) into an antiparallel G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA fold.








Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical DNA structures implicated in a number of biological processes. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can alter stability and folding of G4s, which can potentially be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In this work, we investigate the interaction of telomeric DNA fragment from Tetrahymena thermophila (TET25, 5&#8242;&#8208;G(TTGGGG)4&#8208;3&#8242;) with a G4 ligand PyDH2 belonging to the bisquinolinium family. When alone, TET25 adopts a mixture of three conformations, with the most abundant being a four&#8208;tetrad hybrid G4. In the presence of PyDH2, surprisingly, TET25 folds into an antiparallel chair G4, with PyDH2 intercalated between G&#8208;tetrads 2 and 3, according to our crystal structure. The structure represents the second example, and the first crystallographic evidence, of ligand intercalation into a G4. In solution, the interaction of PyDH2 and TET25 leads to a number of complexes differing by G4 topology and binding stoichiometry, strong stabilization of G4 (&#8710;Tm&#160;=&#160;12.4&#160;&#176;C in the presence of one equiv. of PyDH2) and large hysteresis of &#8764;10&#160;&#176;C, suggesting that ligand binding and G4 folding processes are complex.

         <title>Scalable Main Group Mechanocatalytic CO2 Valorisation to Cyclocarbonate Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a scalable mechanocatalytic method for synthesizing cyclic carbonates from solid and liquid epoxides using CO&#8322; at 1 bar and room temperature. Employing a gallium aminotrisphenolate catalyst, this process achieves high yields, efficiently transforms multi&#8208;terminal epoxides, and outperforms solution&#8208;based methods in green metrics, setting a benchmark for sustainable synthesis.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, main group elements have gained attention as promising substitutes for precious metals in catalytic processes. Additionally, mechanochemistry is emerging as a field with the potential to promote catalytic reactions under mild conditions. Herein, we report a scalable, main&#8208;group mechanocatalytic synthesis of cyclic carbonates from both solid and liquid epoxides, using CO&#8322; as a renewable feedstock under mild conditions with a gallium aminotrisphenolate catalyst. Unlike solution&#8208;based methods that generally require high temperatures and/or high CO&#8322; pressures, this mechanocatalytic process operates at just 1 bar and room temperature. The developed mechanochemical method affords the targeted compounds in high yields while also enabling efficient transformation of multi&#8208;terminal epoxides and avoiding the conversion losses typically observed in solution. Furthermore, this scalable method outperforms solution&#8208;based approaches across all green metrics, setting a new benchmark for environmentally friendly synthesis.

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Enhanced NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thirty&#8208;two polarizing agents consisting of dinitroxide and hetero biradicals are compared at magnetic fields of 9.4 T, 14.1 T, and 21.1 T, in organic and aqueous solvents. Their detailed enhancement factors, polarization build&#8208;up times, contribution factors, and the resultant overall sensitivity gains are measured. Hetero biradicals yields excellent performance across all fields measured here, guiding new design perspectives for future PA development.








Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can significantly enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, via the transfer of polarization from unpaired electrons to nuclei. As a result, there is considerable interest in improving DNP efficiency, particularly through the development of new polarizing agents (PAs). Here, a series of 32 PAs, including 26 dinitroxide and 6 hetero biradicals, of which 11 are introduced for the first time, were evaluated for their performance in DNP NMR experiments at magnetic field strengths of 9.4 T, 14.1 T, and 21.1 T. The PAs that are soluble in aqueous media were compared for different proton concentrations. A detailed comparison of the enhancement factors, polarization build&#8208;up times, contribution factors, and the resulting overall sensitivity factors is provided. We find that the class of narrow&#8208;line&#8208;broad&#8208;line biradicals not only yield the best performance at high field (21.1 T and 14.1 T) but remain among the best at intermediate fields (9.4 T). Specifically, SNAPol&#8208;1 and HyTEK2 are consistently among the best performing radicals at any field. Among the dinitroxides, notably at 9.4 T, the AsymPol&#8208;POK and M&#8208;TinyPol families stand out in proton&#8208;dense aqueous matrices, and a newly developed dinitroxide, NaphPolCbo, is found to provide the best overall sensitivity factor in organic solvent.

         <title>Multivariate MOF Hollow Fiber Membranes with Precision&#8208;Tuned Subnanometer Channels Toward Aromatic Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate MOF (MTV&#8208;MOF) hollow fiber membranes with precision&#8208;tuned subnanometer channels were fabricated by leveraging the heterogeneous spatial distribution of ligands, where reduced coordination energy barriers drive the formation of alternating narrow&#8208;wide channels. This configuration achieves highly efficient membrane separation of aromatic hydrocarbons with reduced transport resistance. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes exhibit great potential for molecular separations, but it remains a considerable challenge to achieve precise pore aperture regulation, typically requiring the synthesis of distinct MOF structures for each targeted separation. Herein, the first multivariate MOF (MTV&#8208;MOF) hollow fiber membranes with precision&#8208;tuned subnanometer channels have been fabricated by leveraging the heterogeneous spatial distribution of ligands, where reduced coordination energy barriers drive the formation of alternating narrow (local&#8208;path limited) and wide channels, simultaneously addressing the critical permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in membrane separations. The alternating narrow&#8208;wide channel architecture has been systematically investigated through combined density functional theory calculation, molecular dynamics simulation and mathematical modeling, with direct experimental validation provided by low&#8208;dose high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and quantitative adsorption analysis. These MTV&#8208;MOF membranes demonstrated the ability to selectively separate aromatic hydrocarbons achieving highly selective separation while reduce the molecular transport barriers, offering significant potential for industrial separation processes.

         <title>Selective Hydrogenation of Phenols to Cyclohexanones Over Hydrotalcite&#8208;Supported Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the single&#8208;atom catalysis for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic ring without saturation of the carbonyl group. By coordinating with calcined hydrotalcite (CHT)&#8208;derived oxygen atoms, Pd&#8211;O&#8211;MgAl environment in the Pd/CHT single&#8208;atom catalyst is formed and identified as the catalytic site for the efficient hydrogenation of phenolic compounds, which can afford &gt;99.9% yields of the desired cyclohexanones.








Abstract
Cyclohexanones are widely used chemicals and currently produced by the oxidation of the fossil feedstocks. Direct selective hydrogenation of lignin derivatives has great potential for producing these chemicals, but is challenging to obtain high yields. Here, we report that hydrotalcite&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;atom (Pd/CHT&#8208;800) catalyst enabled the hydrogenation of the benzene ring in the aromatics without the overreaction of carbonyl group, which could afford &gt;99.9% yield of cyclohexanones using water as the reaction medium. The reaction mechanism was systematically studied by the control experiments and detailed in situ characterizations. In the Pd/CHT&#8208;800 catalyst, the Pd&#8208;O&#8208;MgAl sites were formed, and the cooperation of the Pd atoms and calcined CHT material could not only realize the aromatic hydrogenation efficiently, but also inhibit the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group in the reaction effectively. This work provides a novel route for the sustainable production of cyclohexanones.

         <title>Access to Diverse Activatable Heptamethine Cyanine Probes with Low Intrinsic Fluorescence via 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig Cyclization Strategy for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a general strategy for developing activatable heptamethine cyanine probes by regulating the exo&#8208;side&#8208;armed cyclization and ring&#8208;opening structures, thereby eliminating intrinsic background fluorescence and providing a substantial turn&#8208;on response (up to 184&#8208;fold). These novel probes are insensitive to physiological pH, polarity, and protein interaction, allowing them to precisely detect diverse biomarkers in vivo.








Abstract
The conversion of conventional &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; cyanine dyes into activatable NIR probes with low inherent fluorescence remains challenging, resulting in poor imaging contrast and nonspecific response in vivo. We herein report a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization strategy to create diverse activatable heptamethine cyanine probes with &#8220;zero&#8221; intrinsic background fluorescence for high&#8208;contrast bioimaging. This intramolecular ring&#8208;closure approach imparts a built&#8208;in switch to regulate the fluorescence of cyanine dyes, which predominantly exist in the nonfluorescent closed&#8208;loop form at pH over 5.0 and are not affected by environmental polarity and protein interaction, thereby reducing false&#8208;positive fluorescent signals. Upon reaction with various biomarkers, including methylglyoxal (MGO), hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), they could rapidly transform into fluorescent open&#8208;loop structures, showing significant NIR fluorescence enhancement (up to 184&#8208;fold). Furthermore, we extended this strategy to develop a variety of NIR&#8208;II ATP&#8208;activatable cyanine probes for the first time, as well as a theranostic probe 57 using host&#8211;guest chemistry. Probe 57 not only sensitively monitored ATP levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio of 48/1, but it also precisely detected extracellular ATP in stools. This work opens a new avenue to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive NIR cyanine probes for improving disease diagnosis.

         <title>Metal Complexes Stimulating Immunogenic Pyroptosis as Burgeoning Antitumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the cutting&#8208;edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis, elucidating their pyroptosis&#8208;stimulating mechanisms across chemo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, sono&#8208; and targeted therapeutic modalities, and proposes the prevailing challenges and future opportunities in metal&#8208;based immunotherapy.








Abstract
The exploration of antitumor agents with diverse action mechanisms has become an important focus in both fundamental research and clinical oncology, driven by the need for more effective cancer therapies. Metal complexes, with their versatile chemical, photophysical, and biological properties, represent an ideal class of therapeutic and diagnostic candidates for investigating novel antitumor mechanisms. Recent advances have underscored their unique ability to trigger diverse cell death pathways. Among these, pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has garnered substantial attention because of its intrinsic link to antitumor immunity. This minireview focuses on the cutting&#8208;edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis and elucidates their pyroptosis&#8208;stimulating mechanisms across chemo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, sono&#8208; and targeted therapeutic modalities. By dissecting the interplay among pyroptosis induction, biological processes, such as inflammasome activation and gasdermin cleavage, and subsequent immune reprogramming, we provide a thorough overview of the action mechanisms of metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducers. This understanding has inspired the rational development of novel anticancer metal complexes that can remodel the tumor microenvironment and synergize with immunotherapies.

This minireview focuses on the cutting-edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis and elucidates their pyroptosis-stimulating mechanisms across chemo-, photo-, sono- and targeted therapeutic modalities. By dissecting the interplay among pyroptosis induction, biological processes, such as inflammasome activation and gasdermin cleavage, and subsequent immune reprogramming, we provide a thorough overview of the action mechanisms of metal complex-based pyroptosis inducers. This understanding has inspired the rational development of novel anticancer metal complexes that can remodel the tumor microenvironment and synergize with immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy Reveals Spatially Resolved Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in CdS/BiOBr S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ KPFM reveals charge&#8208;transfer mechanism in CdS/BiOBr S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. Upon light illumination, the Fermi level (Ef) of n&#8208;type semiconductors rises, generating a built&#8208;in electric field that drives photogenerated carrier separation. Electrons accumulate on CdS, lowering its surface photovoltage (SPV), while holes accumulate on BiOBr, elevating its SPV above that of the bare semiconductors, highlighting efficient charge separation.








Abstract
S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions hold great promise for photocatalysis, yet a comprehensive understanding of their charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms remains limited. While time&#8208;resolved techniques have provided valuable insights, the spatial resolution of charge transfer at the material surface remains underexplored. Here, we employ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, revealing spatially resolved details. Our findings show that upon illumination, the Fermi level (Ef) of n&#8208;type semiconductors increases, but a built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) persists within the heterojunction. Electrons accumulate on the surface of the reduction semiconductor (RS), resulting in a surface photovoltage (SPV) lower than that of the individual semiconductor, while holes accumulate on the oxidation semiconductor (OS) surface, producing an SPV higher than that of the bare material. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction leads to a remarkable increase in charge separation, with 11 additional photogenerated electrons and 3722 additional holes compared to the bare CdS and BiOBr. These results offer critical insights into the spatially resolved charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions.

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species via Orbital Rehybridization Between Intermediate and Active Site for Selective Methane Photooxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique regulation mechanism of reactive oxygen was proposed for selectively photocatalytic conversion of methane to methanol under mild conditions. This new mechanism addresses the contradiction between activity and selectivity faced with the traditional uncontrolled generation of reactive oxygen species by regulating the interaction between active centers and key intermediate.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as&#8208;formed ROS by introducing Au single atoms (SAs) on CuOx/ZnO (Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d&#8208;band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO&#8208;*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2&#8208;pz and dxz/dyz&#8208;px. This facilitated the dissociation of O&#9472;O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C&#8211;H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4 molecules. As a result, Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856&#160;&#181;mol&#183;gcat.&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions.

         <title>Engineering Mechanostable Anticalin Scaffolds to Enhance Particle Adhesion and Targeting of CTLA&#8208;4 under Shear Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e. anchor point) within a non&#8208;antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA&#8208;4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio&#8208;orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single&#8208;molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead&#8208;based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA&#8208;4) complex. Multi&#8208;regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA&#8208;4&#8217;s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA&#8208;4 targets and provides a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Boosting of Second Harmonic Generation and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Metal Halides through Enhanced Octahedral Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), characterized by their non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystal structures and exceptional photophysical properties, are promising for second&#8208;order nonlinear and linear optics, including second harmonic generation (SHG) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral HMHs with simultaneously strong SHG response and efficient CPL still presents a challenge, due to the distinct structural and electronic requirements of these properties. Here, we report a halogen substitution strategy within inorganic octahedra to modulate the crystal structure and simultaneously enhance both SHG and CPL properties. Three pairs of chiral Sb&#8208;based HMHs are synthesized: (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr6 (MBA = &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylammonium, IA = imidazole, abbreviated as R/S&#8208;SbBr6), (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr2.8Cl3.2 (R/S&#8208;SbBr2.8Cl3.2), and (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbCl6 (R/S&#8208;SbCl6). The gradual halogen substitution from R/S&#8208;SbBr6 to R/S&#8208;SbCl6 significantly enhances the structural chirality of inorganic octahedra, resulting in a strong SHG response intensity of 1.4 &#215; KDP and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor of 3.82 &#215; 10&#8208;2. The combination of SHG and CPL performance outperforms that of previous chiral HMHs. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that these enhancements originate from gradually increased octahedral distortions induced by halogen substitution. This work establishes a structural optimization strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance SHG and CPL in chiral HMHs, paving the way for their broader photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Birefringence and Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Transmission by Coordination Induced Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Pyridine&#8208;Carboxylate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant birefringent crystal with large band&#8208;gap is of paramount importance for modern optical devices but simultaneous achievement of giant birefringence and large band&#8208;gap is a great challenge stemming from their inherent contradictory relationship according to Kramers&#8210;Kronig equation. Herein, an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid uniformly&#8208;stacked two&#8208;dimensional crystal [Be2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(C7H3NO4)(H2O)]&#183;H2O (I) was successfully synthesized by a molecular crystal engineering involving hydrogen bond synthons. Layered I features new [Be2O2N(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(H2O)]&#8734; helical chain composed of BeII tetrahedral coordination, and the strong covalent BeII cations coordinate with the O and N atoms on birefringence&#8208;active &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; organic groups with optimal spatial arrangement. As a result, I demonstrates the largest birefringence of 0.6 in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) spectral region, with large band&#8208;gap of 4.75 eV and short UV absorption edge of 261 nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses uncover that the superior optical properties mainly originate from collective effects of highly&#8208;active (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; groups, distorted Be&#8208;tetrahedral units and their uniform stacking. This work not only provides a potential solar&#8208;blind UV birefringent crystal for rapidly increasing number of optical applications but also a new chance for the rational design of wide UV giant birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Coordination Microenvironment of Nickel Molecular Complexes for Electrooxidation of Organic Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical oxidation of organic nucleophiles to value&#8208;added chemicals using nickel&#8208;based catalysts is promising yet hindered by the dynamic evolution of nickel coordination structures during catalysis.&#160;Herein,&#160;we engineered atomically exposed nickel single&#8208;site catalysts&#160;anchored on functional carbon black through tailored aromatic ligands coordination. This unique spatial coordination structure efficiently promotes the reconstruction of high&#8208;valence NiIII&#8208;OOH sites, which boost electrooxidation of 18 organic substrates with peak current density exceeding 800 mA cm&#8208;2. Especially, the optimal electrocatalyst achieves record mass activities of 4.38 and 4.26 A mgNi&#8208;1 for methanol and ethylene glycol oxidation, respectively. In&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical analyses elucidate that the atomically exposed NiIII&#8208;OOH centers would directly adsorb organic substrates, thereby enhancing C&#8208;C/C&#8208;H bonds cleavage efficiency. Meanwhile, the proton abstraction from C&#8208;H bond would enable reversible redox cycling between NiII&#8208;OH and NiIII&#8208;OOH, sustaining catalytic activity. This study advances the understanding of organic oxidation mechanisms and showcase the great potential of molecular complexes in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Inwardly Directed Linker Propagation: Constructing 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited design strategy of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) greatly restricts their structural diversification and potential applications. Herein, we propose inwardly directed linker propagation strategy to targeted assemble of 3D COFs (COF&#8208;IN&#8208;1 and COF&#8208;IN&#8208;2), and comparing them with outwardly directed expanded COFs (COF&#8208;OUT&#8208;1 and COF&#8208;OUT&#8208;2). COF&#8208;OUTs exhibits planar heteroporous 2D frameworks with cpt topology, while COF&#8208;INs engineer controlled triple entanglements into networks, forming 3D framework with acs topology. Moreover, the COFs assembled via inwardly directed linker propagation effectively enhanced the production of H2O2 photosynthesis.To demonstrate the application potential, a biphasic &#64258;uid system was constructed for continuous H2O2photosynthesis and extraction. This work not only expands the design strategy for achieving 3D COFs, but also demonstrate that the dimensional regulation of frameworks and tuning of applications can arise from different expanding directions of the linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Cooperative Strategy for Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport&#160;Layer towards Fully Printed High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enabling large&#8208;area deposition of dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport layers (HTLs) with high reproducibility and  uniformity is crucial for fully printed n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) modules. However, typical polymer hole transport materials (HTMs), with non&#8208;Newtonian fluid characteristics, show shear rate&#8208;dependent viscosity during the printing process, whereas blade&#8208;coated small&#8208;molecule HTLs often exhibit unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity; these factors impose challenges on blade&#8208;coating of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area HTL films. Here, we designed a dopant&#8208;free small molecule BDT&#8208;MB with high mobility, and further proposed a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy by combining with polymer D18. The mechanism was clearly clarified that the pre&#8208;aggregated polymer D18 acted as a &#8220;seed crystal&#8221; to induce preferential face&#8208;on orientation of small molecule BDT&#8208;MB through intermolecular C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction. This strategy not only suppresses the unfavorable assembly behavior of small molecular HTMs, but also overcomes the solute random distribution by tuning the solution with high and constant viscosity. It facilitates printing large&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free HTLs with high uniformity and ordered fiber&#8208;like morphology. The resultant small&#8208;area pero&#8208;SCs (0.062 cm2) and large&#8208;area fully printed modules(15.64 cm2) both achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04%.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Secondary Structure Patterns in Short&#8208;Range Cross&#8208;Link Atlas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short&#8208;range cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) reveals secondary structure&#8208;dependent patterns in proteome&#8208;wide datasets. By integrating XL&#8208;MS data with AlphaFold&#8208;predicted structures, we introduce X&#8208;SPAN, a novel validation metric that assesses data quality and enables pLDDT score benchmarking.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) has become a powerful tool in structural biology for investigating protein structure, dynamics, and interactomics. However, short&#8208;range cross&#8208;links, defined as those connecting residues fewer than 20 positions apart, have traditionally been considered less informative and largely overlooked, leaving significant data unexplored in a systematic manner. Here, we present a system&#8208;wide analysis of short&#8208;range cross&#8208;links, demonstrating their intrinsic correlation with protein secondary structure. We introduce the X&#8208;SPAN (Cross&#8208;link Structural Pattern Analyzer) software, which integrates publicly available XL&#8208;MS datasets from system&#8208;wide experiments with AlphaFold&#8208;predicted protein structures. Our analysis reveals distinct cross&#8208;linking patterns that reflect the spatial constraints imposed by secondary structural elements. Specifically, &#945;&#8208;helices exhibit periodic cross&#8208;linking patterns consistent with their characteristic helical pitch, whereas coils and &#946;&#8208;strands display nearly monotonic distributions. A context&#8208;dependent protein grammar reinforces short&#8208;range cross&#8208;link specificity. Short&#8208;range cross&#8208;links can enhance the statistical inference of secondary structures within integrative modeling workflows. Additionally, our work establishes a framework for benchmarking AlphaFold's local prediction accuracy and provides novel quality control criteria for XL&#8208;MS experiments. We anticipate that X&#8208;SPAN and our short&#8208;range cross&#8208;link database will serve as a valuable resource for exploring local secondary structure rearrangements and their potential roles in protein function and allosteric regulation.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based tools are emerging as innovative solutions to interfere with biological pathways in molecular biology and medicine. They offer advantages over traditional small molecules due to their adaptable structural diversity and their ability to engage previously inaccessible cellular targets. However, most proteins do not penetrate the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells and are therefore restricted to extracellular targets. Despite recent advances, a general method for the delivery of functional proteins into human cells remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a bioreversible protein modification strategy of amines using short arginine&#8208;containing peptides (termed BioRAM), that enables cytosolic delivery starting from genetically non&#8208;engineered proteins. We optimized the bioconjugation&#8208;strategy to achieve fast intracellular cleavage and complete recovery of the native protein. In combination with our previously established cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;additive protocol, we show superior delivery of fluorescent protein and functional RNase A into the cytosol, achieving physiological response. Moreover, we are able to demonstrate the excellent performance of BioRAM in the presence of serum, thereby broadening the scope for intracellular applications of functional proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Driven Borrowing Hydrogen Processes for Ru&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Alkylation: A Pathway to Enhanced Sustainability and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the first mechanochemical borrowing hydrogenation (BH) strategy, offering a direct and efficient route to N&#8208;alkylated amines and heterocycles. This solvent&#8208;free approach overcomes many challenges associated with conventional solution&#8208;based syntheses, such as toxic reagents, inert atmospheres, high temperatures, lengthy reaction times, excessive catalyst loadings, and the use of solvents. By applying this method under mechanochemical conditions and employing a readily available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst, we achieved high conversions of a diverse set of primary amines and alcohols into N&#8208;alkylated amines. Furthermore, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and Hammett analyses provided key insights into the underlying reaction mechanism. Ultimately, this protocol expands synthetic possibilities by facilitating the preparation of heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering A Multifunctional Nanoenzyme Platform for Synergistic Melanoma Therapy: Integrating Enzyme Activity, Immune Activation, and Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanoma is characterized by rapid growth and high invasiveness, resulting in an exceptionally high malignancy and a significant propensity for metastasis. Current therapeutic modalities, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, exhibit limited efficacy due to severe side effects and immunosuppressive effects. Consequently, the development of precise and effective integrated therapeutic strategies is of paramount importance. Here, we report a multifunctional and multi&#8208;enzyme active nanosystem (FeCP@PDA&#8208;GOx) that synergistically integrates starvation therapy, chemodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and immunotherapy to achieve multidimensional therapeutic effects. This nanoplatform harnesses the enzymatic activities of glucose oxidase (GOx), peroxidase (POD), oxidase (OXD), and catalase (CAT) to enhance tumor microenvironment modulation ad drug delivery efficiency, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells. The system also establishes a positive feedback loop to further amplify its catalytic performance. Additionally, it effectively suppresses the expression of heat shock proteins in tumor cells, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT. Moreover, the system activates robust immune responses, suppressing lung metastasis and eliciting systemic antitumor effects to inhibit the growth of distal tumors. Experimental results demonstrate that this multifunctional nanoplatform exhibits exceptional therapeutic efficacy and safety in melanoma treatment, laying a solid foundation for the advancement of personalized medicine and intelligent therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Lignin Dissolution and Direct Ultrasmall&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Nanoparticle Formation in Acidic and Alkaline Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Molecular&#8208;Level Insight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural interpretation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how molecular moieties and interaction networks influence the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structures and conformational states of lignin during dissolution and aggregation: laterally shifted in deep eutectic solvents, offset&#8208;stacked in tetrahydrofuran, and stretched in dimethyl sulfoxide.








Abstract
Although deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have demonstrated significant potential in lignin processing, their influence on molecular stacking and conformational evolution during lignin dissolution and nanoparticle formation remains insufficiently understood. Here, we develop a green, straightforward, and single&#8208;step approach to produce self&#8208;assembled lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNPs obtained using the acidic DES method exhibited a great size reduction, with an average size approximately one&#8208;ninth of that produced by conventional solvent&#8208;exchange methods. To gain mechanistic insights into the reconstruction, dissolution, and self&#8208;assembly of lignin in DESs, we integrate structural characterization with molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic behavior and configurational states of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass lignin models (4,182&#160;g mol&#8722;1) in aqueous solvent systems. The results reveal the critical role of molecular structure, intra/intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, stacked conformations, solvent&#8208;specific effects in determining the size and compactness of LNPs. Notably, the DES stabilizes lateral&#8208;shifted configurations, promoting the formation of small and compact LNPs. In contrast, the tetrahydrofuran/H2O solvent system favors offset&#8208;stacked configurations and hydrophobic interactions, leading to larger, spherical LNPs. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of LNP formation using DESs, demonstrating the possibility of regulating and controlling lignin assemblies through solvent parameters.

         <title>Rapid Access to an Enantioenriched Spiro Bisindole Directly from Indole and Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective one&#8208;pot &#8220;self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy was developed for the exceedingly convenient access to a spiro bisindole directly from indole and acetone. The obtained enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric bisindole showed exceptional performance as a chiral backbone of diverse effective catalysts or ligands.








Abstract
Disclosed here is a &#8220;one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of a spiro bisindole molecule directly from indole and acetone. This convenient synthesis contrasts drastically to the typical long sequence required for other privileged C2&#8208;symmetric spirocycles. The use of an alcohol additive in cooperation with chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis proved crucial to the good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The favorable interaction between the additive and CPA was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The obtained enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric bisindole was demonstrated as a useful backbone of chiral catalysts/ligands.

         <title>Concurrent Production of Glycolic Acid via Anode Valorization of Plastic Paired With Cathode Upcycling of Biomass Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired electrolysis system for simultaneous glycolic acid production was constructed through combining anodic oxidation of polyethylene terephthalate hydrolysate and cathodic reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which was enabled by the rational design of a CO&#8208;tolerant PdBi alloy anode and an earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into valuable chemicals, such as glycolic acid (GA), provides a sustainable route for reclaiming the carbon resource in plastic wastes. However, valorization of EG to GA is realized solely via anodic oxidation, which is typically accompanied by the generation of low&#8208;value hydrogen at the cathode. Here, we develop a GA production system that combines anodic and cathodic GA production via oxidation of PET&#8208;derived EG paired with reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which is made possible by the discovery of a robust PdBi alloy anode and earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode. Building on the theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of anti&#8208;CO poisoning on the PdBi anode and temperature&#8208;dependent GA electrosynthesis on the TiO2 cathode, our integrated electrochemical system achieves a total Faradaic efficiency of 182% for GA production. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrochemical coupling strategy paves the way for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of surplus plastic&#8208;/biomass&#8208;derived feedstocks via renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalysis.

         <title>Mitigating Molecular Aggregation in Drug Discovery With Predictive Insights From Explainable AI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, MEGAN, our explainable AI model, is applied to predict small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs), a significant source of false positives in drug discovery. MEGAN provides interpretable predictions and proposes structurally similar, non&#8208;aggregating alternative molecules. Experimental validation of one such alternative demonstrates MEGAN's potential to guide molecular design and improve high&#8208;throughput screening reliability.








Abstract
Herein, we present the application of multi&#8208;channel graph attention network (MEGAN), our explainable AI (xAI) model, for the identification of small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs). This work offers solutions to the long&#8208;standing problem of false positives caused by SCAMs in high&#8208;throughput screening for drug discovery and demonstrates the power of xAI in the classification of molecular properties that are not chemically intuitive based on our current understanding. We leverage xAI insights and molecular counterfactuals to design alternatives to problematic compounds in drug screening libraries. Additionally, we experimentally validate the MEGAN prediction classification for one of the counterfactuals and demonstrate the utility of counterfactuals for altering the aggregation properties of a compound through minor structural modifications.

     alt="Mitigating Molecular Aggregation in Drug Discovery With Predictive Insights From Explainable AI"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, MEGAN, our explainable AI model, is applied to predict small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs), a significant source of false positives in drug discovery. MEGAN provides interpretable predictions and proposes structurally similar, non-aggregating alternative molecules. Experimental validation of one such alternative demonstrates MEGAN's potential to guide molecular design and improve high-throughput screening reliability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present the application of multi-channel graph attention network (MEGAN), our explainable AI (xAI) model, for the identification of small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs). This work offers solutions to the long-standing problem of false positives caused by SCAMs in high-throughput screening for drug discovery and demonstrates the power of xAI in the classification of molecular properties that are not chemically intuitive based on our current understanding. We leverage xAI insights and molecular counterfactuals to design alternatives to problematic compounds in drug screening libraries. Additionally, we experimentally validate the MEGAN prediction classification for one of the counterfactuals and demonstrate the utility of counterfactuals for altering the aggregation properties of a compound through minor structural modifications. The integration of this method in high-throughput screening approaches will help combat and circumvent false positives, providing better lead molecules more rapidly and thus accelerating drug discovery cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Solid Conversion into Mechanically Adaptive LiF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase via MgF2 Precursor on Si Surface in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgF2 coating with high coating integrity is in situ constructed on Si nanoparticles. During electrochemical cycling, the MgF2 layer undergoes in situ conversion into LiF and Mg, thereby forming a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high mechanical adaptability, excellent electronic insulation, and high ionic conductivity. This unique transformed SEI layer effectively mitigates mechanical degradation and interfacial side reactions, contributing to significantly enhanced electrochemical properties of the Si anode. 








Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (&#8764;4200&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion (&#8764;300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation, and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in situ conversed MgF2 layer (with coating integrity of 94.2%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF2 layer is in situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation, and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF2&#8208;1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 10&#160;C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles). Full&#8208;cell based on the Si@MgF2&#8208;1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon&#8208;based LIBs.

         <title>Intermediate Layer&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanoparticles Enable Deep Bioorthogonal Liver Tumor and Vascular Imaging via Switchable NIR&#8208;II Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the intermediate layer of lanthanide nanoparticles, we achieve switchable NIR&#8208;II emissions, enabling high&#8208;resolution vascular imaging at 1525&#160;nm and deep bioorthogonal liver tumor imaging at 1064&#160;nm. This will provide reference for designing imaging probes to adapt to fluorescence imaging in different scenes.








Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has become an attractive optical region for fluorescence imaging. However, due to the complexity in vivo, NIR&#8208;II light with various wavelengths for different imaging scenes has not been investigated. Here, we found that 1525&#160;nm light is suitable for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging due to low background interference, while its attenuation in vivo makes it unsuitable for deep imaging. The 1064&#160;nm light is suitable for deep imaging. The impact of Yb3+ ions and the proportion of the intermediate layer in lanthanide nanoparticles on the modulation of emissions were investigated. The intense 1064&#160;nm emission is achievable when the Yb3+ content is 80% and the intermediate layer proportion is 0.1. The bioorthogonal orthotopic liver tumor imaging could be achieved by modifying the lanthanide nanoparticles with DBCO&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE and establishing artificial receptors by N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;tetraacylated (Ac4ManNAz). Lanthanide nanoparticles with the intermediate layer proportion of 0.66 and 80% Yb3+ facilitate intense 1525&#160;nm emission, enabling the vascular imaging. Based on the imaging characteristics of NIR&#8208;II emissions with different wavelengths in vivo, this work achieves high&#8208;resolution imaging and deep imaging through intermediate layer regulation of lanthanide nanoparticles, providing an opportunity to explore a new generation of high&#8208;performance fluorescent probes.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Branched PdCoPx Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis strategy was used to prepare branched Pd1Co2Px nanostructures with rich Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interface sites, demonstrating their efficacy as cathode catalysts for lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). The Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces can direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products, which enhances the stability of LOB cycling. 








Abstract
Developing advanced cathode materials plays a positive role in lowering the charge/discharge overpotentials and improving the cycling performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Here we report a direct synthesis strategy to prepare high&#8208;dimensional branched PdCoPx series nanostructures, in which the Pd atoms are well dispersed within cobalt phosphide, leading to rich Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces and evoking a prominent ligand effect between the elements. The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46&#160;A mgPd&#8722;1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12&#160;A mgPd&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.17&#160;A mgPt&#8722;1). Using Pd1Co2Px as the cathode, the resulting LOB shows an ultralow discharge/charge overpotential of 0.40&#160;V and could run stably for over 240 cycles, which is a significant improvement compared with the counterparts using CoPx and Pd/C cathodes. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces could direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products. This feature successfully elevates both the charge and discharge performances, as well as the stability of the LOB.

         <title>Operando Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Visualizing Electrochemical Triple&#8208;Phase Boundary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando magnetic resonance imaging has been developed to enable direct visualization of electrochemical triple&#8208;phase boundaries (TPBs). Applied to proton exchange membrane fuel cells, this technique provides in situ monitoring of cathode water accumulation and TPB evolution, facilitating the assessment of flooding effects while simultaneously mapping active reaction zones.








Abstract
The triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) is a complex interface where gas, liquid, and solid phases converge, crucially regulating the efficiency and performance of many electrochemical devices including fuel cells and batteries. However, conventional characterization techniques struggle to capture the dynamic processes and flooding at TPB. To address this, we develop operando electrochemical magnetic resonance imaging (EC&#8208;MRI), an inherently non&#8208;invasive technique sensitive to 1H, which probes both bulk and boundary regions, enabling real&#8208;time visualization of TPB evolution and a deeper understanding of its function at the device level under operational conditions. In a study of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), with a focus on the kinetically sluggish O2 reduction reaction in the cathode, operando EC&#8208;MRI quantitatively illustrates the interplay between power output, water content, and TPB evolution. It reveals that the TPB maps undergo significant spatial and dynamic variations, with TPB deterioration, rather than apparent water accumulation, directly triggering flooding, as proved using catalysts with different water generation and adsorption capabilities. Our finding opens new perspectives on water management and TPB design, with potential applications in other critical electrochemical processes such as H2 oxidation, CO2 reduction, and N2 reduction, underscoring the value of operando EC&#8208;MRI for real&#8208;time diagnostics of electrochemical devices.

In a study of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), with a focus on the kinetically sluggish O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction in the cathode, operando EC-MRI quantitatively illustrates the interplay between power output, water content, and TPB evolution. It reveals that the TPB maps undergo significant spatial and dynamic variations, with TPB deterioration, rather than apparent water accumulation, directly triggering flooding, as proved using catalysts with different water generation and adsorption capabilities. Our finding opens new perspectives on water management and TPB design, with potential applications in other critical electrochemical processes such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, underscoring the value of operando EC-MRI for real-time diagnostics of electrochemical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activatable Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Macromolecular Probe for Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Natural Killer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;detection of tumor&#8208;associated natural killer cells (TANKs) is crucial for evaluating cancer immunotherapy because they are&#160;associated with improved overall survival in cancer patients. However, existing analytical methods relying on tissue biopsy are invasive and static, restricting their capacity to deliver dynamic information. Herein, we report an activatable fluorescence/photoacoustic macromolecular reporter (BhCyNK) for real&#8208;time&#160;monitoring&#160;of&#160;TANKs for cancer immunotherapy. To optimize the photoacoustic performance, the fluorophore&#160;sca&#64256;old&#160;of BhCyNK is screened via a molecular engineering strategy involving acceptor replacement and heavy atom incorporation. Among four hemicyanine derivatives, BhCyS&#160;with the longest absorption peak&#160;as well as the&#160;highest photothermal conversion efficiency and PA brightness is constructed into&#160;an&#160;activatable probe&#160;(BhCyNK), which specifically turns on its near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signal (by&#160;10&#8208;fold&#160;increase) and PA signal (by&#160;8.3&#8208;fold&#160;increase) in the presence of a TANK overexpressed protease. Thus, BhCyNK effectively distinguishes natural killer cells from other immune cells including T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages.&#160;The&#160;high specificity of BhCyNK enables real&#8208;time monitoring of TANKs population in the tumor of living mice amid cancer immunotherapies&#160;through systemic administration. The imaging results reveal that the increasing intratumoral signal of BhCyNK after combination immunotherapy correlates well with the increasing population of TANKs.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts Supported on CeOx&#160;Nanoislands with Various Ligand Environments Including Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metals that are dispersed atomically on supports offer new and potentially valuable catalytic properties associated with their high atom efficiencies and opportunities for tuning their electronic properties by choice of the support and other ligands bonded to them. Herein, we report the synthesis of atomically dispersed Pt, Rh, and Ir anchored on CeOx nanoislands on a high&#8208;area SiO2 support. Synthesis from chloride&#8208;containing metal salts gave metal complexes chemisorbed on the supported nanoislands, with Pt being prototypical and having a structure approximated as Pt1Cl2O4, as shown by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and calculations at the level of density functional theory (DFT). Calcination converted the adsorbed species into a structure represented as Pt1O6, embedded in the CeOx lattice. The Pt1Cl2O4 was observed to have a higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation than the chloride&#8208;free, embedded Pt1O6 species, and DFT results indicate the role of chloride in enhancing the catalytic activity of the isolated Pt, in contrast to its role as an inhibitor when Pt is present as nanoparticles. This work emphasizes the importance of the first coordination shell in controlling the catalytic properties of atomically dispersed noble metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Crucial Role of Oxygen Evolution Reaction for Boosting the Electroxidative C&#8208;C Bond Cleavage in Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic oxidative cleavage of the C&#8211;C bond is highly effective for converting biomass lignin into high&#8208;value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the applied oxidative potential usually competes in the aqueous environment. Despite this challenge, this study found that OER does not entirely hinder the cleavage process but rather acts as a synergistic catalytic step. By using defect&#8208;rich carbon nanotubes as the electrocatalyst and combining experimental and theoretical analysis, we found that the reactive oxygen species (O2&#8722;) formed before *O2 desorption (the rate&#8208;determining step in OER) serve as the key oxygen source. These species could interact with the enolate intermediate of lignin, which facilitates the in situ production of aromatic compounds. Under the optimal potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 98.8% of 2&#8208;phenoxyacetophenone is converted into phenol and benzoic acid via C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; bond cleavage, with yields of 62.31% and 43.42%, respectively. Additionally, the depolymerization of quasi&#8208;natural poplar lignin achieves a total monomer yield of up to 12.41 wt%. This study provides new mechanistic insights into C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; bond cleavage during electrocatalytic lignin depolymerization under alkaline conditions, contributing to efficient biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Mediated Photoreversible Switch Between 2D and 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photoresponsive crystalline porous materials, the light&#8208;driven reversible topological transformation is of particular interest, as it can cause an overall change in structure and lead to more drastic switch in material properties, but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;OF) self&#8208;assembled by photochromic diarylethene (DAE) and tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane (TAM) via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Light irradiation drives isomerization of DAE, and the internal strain generated during photoisomerization is released through dissolution and recrystallization, which are accompanied by the breaking and reestablishment of hydrogen bonds. Benefit from the weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds and good solution processability of HOFs, solution&#8208;mediated reversible switch between 3D and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) HOF is achieved by ring&#8208;open/ring&#8208;close photoisomerization of the DAE moiety controlled by remotely alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Loading lanthanide complex into HOF enables DAE photoisomerization&#8208;controlled photochromic fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between the lanthanide and DAE moiety, resulting in reversible luminescence on/off switch in the host&#8208;guest, capable of intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting in a non&#8208;invasive manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the N&#8211;N Coupling Mechanism over Iron&#8211;Copper Alloy Catalysts during Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of COx&#8208;free hydrogen via the ammonia decomposition reaction (ADR) using Fe&#8208;based non&#8208;precious metal catalysts has attracted much attention. N&#8208;H bond cleavage and N&#8208;N coupling are two key steps in NH3 decomposition, however, stronger Fe&#8208;N binding leads to iron catalysts typically exhibit lower activity. Herein, we develop FeCu alloy catalysts with optimized metal&#8208;nitrogen binding energy by incorporating Cu, a metal with inherently weaker nitrogen affinity, into Fe&#8208;based catalysts. The optimized Fe1Cu0.5/MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 139.1 mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 550 &#176;C under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV = 360,000 h&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that the modulation of the d&#8208;band structure due to the alloying effect optimizes the dissociation of NH3 and the binding ability of N* intermediates in the ADR process. Notably, in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) combined with theoretical calculations confirm that FeCu alloying effectively reduces the N&#8208;N recombination energy barrier from 2.25 eV (Fe cluster) to 1.77 eV (FeCu cluster). These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of highly active Fe&#8208;based catalysts for efficient ammonia decomposition and sustainable hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Plastics of the Future? An Interdisciplinary Review on Biobased and Biodegradable Polymers: Progress in Chemistry, Societal Views, and Environmental Implications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This interdisciplinary article explores the potential of biodegradable and biobased polymers (BBPs) to address plastic pollution and microplastic generation. It examines feedstock selection, chemical modification, use, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life scenarios, including biodegradation and environmental impact of BBPs. Societal perceptions and regulatory frameworks are also discussed.








Abstract
Global demand to reduce polymer waste and microplastics pollution has increased in recent years, prompting further research, development, and wider use of biodegradable and biobased polymers (BBPs). BBPs have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional plastics, with the potential to mitigate the environmental burdens of persistent plastic waste. We provide an updated perspective on their impact, five years after our last article, featuring several recent advances, particularly in exploring broader variety of feedstock, applying novel chemical modifications, and developing new functionalities. Life&#8208;cycle assessments reveal that environmental performance of BBPs depends on several factors including feedstock selection, production efficiency, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life management. Furthermore, the introduction of BBPs in several everyday life products has also influenced consumer perception, market dynamics, and regulatory frameworks. Although offering environmental advantages in specific applications, BBPs also raise concerns regarding their biodegradability under varying environmental conditions, potential microplastic generation, and soil health impacts. We highlight the need for a circular approach considering the entire polymer life cycle, from feedstock sourcing, modification and use, to end&#8208;of&#8208;life options. Interdisciplinary research, collaborative initiatives, and informed policymaking are crucial to unlocking the full potential of BBPs and exploiting their contribution to create a circular economy and more sustainable future.

         <title>Ba&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ge Clathrate Transformation Maximizes Active Site Utilization of Nickel for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, this study demonstrates a huge advantage of the clathrate Ba&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ge intermetallic bulk over metallic nickel as a high&#8208;performance alkaline OER precatalyst. It displays remarkable activity and stability under high current densities, facilitated by a thorough reconstruction process that yields a porous and defective NiOOH nanoarchitecture, as comprehensively examined through a series of in situ and ex situ techniques.








Abstract
Discovering novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (pre)catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is pivotal for advancing decarbonization technologies. In this study, we present the ternary Ba8Ni6Ge40 phase with an open clathrate structure exhibiting remarkable performance in alkaline OER. When integrated into an alkaline water electrolyzer, this clathrate precatalyst achieves high stability under a sustained current density of &#8764;550&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 10 days. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and (micro)structural characterizations, we elucidate the complete electrochemical transformation of Ba8Ni6Ge40 (~90 weight% leaching) forming ultrathin nanosheets composed of a porous and defective NiOOH nanostructure with maximized accessible active site exposure. Notably, a reversible phase transition mainly between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH has also been established in the electrochemical redox process. Meanwhile, the successful application of the model Ba8Ni6Ge40 precatalyst represents a promising new class of functional inorganic materials for water electrolysis.

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Mn&#8211;Br Hybrid Perovskite Assembled by Achiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining rotationally symmetric [Me&#8208;Pr&#8208;dabco]2+ dications with the noncentrosymmetric [MnX4]2&#8722; coordination tetrahedra, a pair of Mn2+&#8208;based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1) were self&#8208;assembled from achiral molecular architectures, which exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance with a record&#8208;high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and remarkable luminous brightness (74&#160;5912&#160;cd m&#8722;2) among reported Mn2+&#8208;based CPL materials.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in various advanced technological fields. CPL activity typically requires compounds that crystallize in noncentrosymmetric chiral space groups. Achieving noncentrosymmetric crystal structures using achiral molecular architectures is highly appealing but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance CPL materials via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using achiral architectures. We successfully obtained Mn2+&#8208;based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1), self&#8208;assembled from [MnBr4]2&#8722; anions and rotational symmetric [Pr&#8208;dabco]2+ cations (Pr&#8208;dabco2+ = 1&#8208;propyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), crystallizing in the chiral space group P212121. The single crystals of 1 exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance, with a luminescence dissymmetry factor |glum| and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 4.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and 86.8%, respectively, thus a record&#8208;high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 among reported Mn2+&#8208;based CPL materials. Furthermore, P/M&#8208;1 based UV&#8208;LED devices demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;emitting performance, including high color&#8208;purity, excellent stability, remarkable luminous brightness (74&#160;591.94&#160;cd m&#8722;2), and a high electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. This study offers a robust strategy for the design and development of high&#8208;performance CPL materials utilizing achiral molecular architectures.

&lt;p&gt;Combining rotationally symmetric [Me-Pr-dabco]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dications with the noncentrosymmetric [MnX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; coordination tetrahedra, a pair of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based halide enantiomeric hybrids (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) were self-assembled from achiral molecular architectures, which exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance with a record-high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable luminous brightness (74&#160;5912&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) among reported Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based CPL materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)-active materials have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in various advanced technological fields. CPL activity typically requires compounds that crystallize in noncentrosymmetric chiral space groups. Achieving noncentrosymmetric crystal structures using achiral molecular architectures is highly appealing but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a strategy for designing and synthesizing high-performance CPL materials via crystallization-driven self-assembly using achiral architectures. We successfully obtained Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based halide enantiomeric hybrids (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), self-assembled from [MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions and rotational symmetric [Pr-dabco]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations (Pr-dabco&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; = 1-propyl-1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octan-1-ium), crystallizing in the chiral space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The single crystals of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance, with a luminescence dissymmetry factor |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 4.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 86.8%, respectively, thus a record-high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; among reported Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based CPL materials. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; based UV-LED devices demonstrated outstanding light-emitting performance, including high color-purity, excellent stability, remarkable luminous brightness (74&#160;591.94&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and a high electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) value of 3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study offers a robust strategy for the design and development of high-performance CPL materials utilizing achiral molecular architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Spectral Narrowing by Strengthening the Soliton&#8208;Like Characteristics through Peripheral Group Substitution in Aromatic Heterocyclic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soliton&#8208;like electronic structure features of compound 2AcPh&#8208;PhF are enhanced by introducing peripheral substituted groups on the parent 2AcPh, which is considered to be the intrinsic reason for its narrowed emission spectra. A sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on 2AcPh&#8208;PhF has achieved an electroluminescence spectrum as narrow as 25&#160;nm and an external quantum efficiency of up to 29.17%.








Abstract
The effect of substituents on the spectral behavior of aromatic heterocyclic systems is a significant yet highly complex issue. Inspired by cyanine dyes, it was found that emission spectrum narrowing can be realized by regulating the terminal substituents to enhance the soliton&#8208;like characteristics of emitters. Herein, compared to the parent compound 2AcPh (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, FWHM&#160;=&#160;0.124&#160;eV), the introduction of fluorobenzene&#8208;group substituents in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF narrows the emission spectral FWHM to 0.108&#160;eV. Single crystal structures reveal more homogeneous carbon&#8211;carbon bond lengths in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF compared to 2AcPh. Theoretical calculations show that the charge magnitudes on carbon atoms of 2AcPh&#8208;PhF also become homogenized, but the charges on adjacent carbon atoms are opposite. These results suggest that the soliton&#8208;like electronic structural characteristics in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF are enhanced after introducing peripheral substituents, which is considered to be the reason for the narrower emission spectrum of 2AcPh&#8208;PhF. The sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on 2AcPh&#8208;PhF demonstrated a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.17% and a small electroluminescent spectral FWHM of 25&#160;nm.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Extraction&#8208;Triggered Phase Engineering of Rhodium Nanomaterials for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a unique phase engineering strategy to prepare unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H) Rh nanomaterials by C extraction from Rh2C with controlled surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. The unusual 2H Rh shows excellent electrocatalytic performance in nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) compared to conventional face&#8208;centered cubic (3C) Rh, which is theoretically verified by the phase&#8208;dependent NO3RR pathway and hydrogen affinity on Rh.








Abstract
Phase engineering plays a crucial role in tuning the physicochemical properties of noble metal nanomaterials. However, synthesis of high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase noble metal nanomaterials remains highly challenging via current wet&#8208;chemical methods. Herein, we develop a unique synthetic methodology to prepare freestanding unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (2H) Rh nanoplates (NPLs) via a rationally designed two&#8208;step strategy. By extracting C from pre&#8208;synthesized rhodium carbide of different sizes and morphology, phase&#8208;controlled synthesis of Rh nanomaterials can be achieved. Impressively, the obtained parallelogram 2H Rh NPLs have high phase purity, well&#8208;defined 2H (0001)h and (101&#175;${\mathrm{\bar{1}}}$0)h facets, and good thermostability (stable up to 300&#160;&#176;C). In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), the 2H Rh NPLs achieve higher ammonia (NH3) Faradaic efficiency (91.9%) and NH3 yield rate (156.97&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) with lower overpotentials compared to the conventional face&#8208;centered cubic (3C) Rh nanocubes with (100)f facets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional (0001)h surface has energetically favored NO3RR pathway and stronger H* absorption ability compared to the (100)f surface, which may lead to the higher activity and selectivity of NH3 production on 2H Rh NPLs. This work opens new avenues to the rational synthesis of unconventional&#8208;phase metal nanomaterials and provides important guidelines to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

The rate and wide&#8208;temperature performance of graphite&#8208;based potassium ion batteries (PIBs) are limited by slow reaction kinetics at the interphases and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability.

Abstract
The rate and wide&#8208;temperature performance of graphite&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are limited by slow reaction kinetics at the interphases and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability. Herein, we strategically designed weak solvating electrolytes (WSEs) to construct an efficient solvated K+ desolvation with K2SO3&#8208;rich SEI and achieve fast reaction kinetics at the electrode interface through the synergy between the SEI and the WSE. As a result of the beneficial fast reaction kinetics and stability of the electrode interface, the graphite anode shows high levels of rate performance and cycling stability, with a capacity of 249.6 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and 96.6% capacity retention after 1600 cycles. Moreover, assembled potassiated graphite (KC8)||Prussian blue nanoparticles (K&#8208;PBNPs) cells in our designed electrolyte show high&#8208;rate performance (63.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1500&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and over wide operating temperature range (&gt;99% Coulombic efficiency for over 1000 cycles and 200 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C and 80&#176;C, respectively). Impressively, the pouch cell shows long&#8208;term stability for 2400 cycles at 500&#160;mAg&#8722;1. This work bridges a longstanding gap, elucidating the synergy between the SEI components and WSEs, leading to fast&#8208;charging&#160;and temperature&#8208;resilient PIBs.

         <title>Enantioselective Photochemical Generation of a Short&#8208;Lived, Twisted Cycloheptenone Isomer: Catalytic Formation, Detection, and Consecutive Chemistry</title>

In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, it was for the first time shown that planar chiral trans&#8208;cycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;enones, such as 2, can be formed enantioselectively from their cis&#8208;isomers by triplet energy transfer from a chiral catalyst. Computational studies performed with cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone and enone 1 provided invaluable insights into the mode of action of the sensitizing thioxanthone catalyst.








Abstract
Cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid undergoes a photochemical isomerization from its cis&#8208; to its trans&#8208;form either upon direct irradiation (&#955;&#160;=&#160;366&#160;nm) or in the presence of a triplet sensitizer (&#955;&#160;=&#160;459&#160;nm). The intermediate chiral trans&#8208;isomer was detected by step&#8208;scan FTIR, displaying a lifetime of 130&#160;&#181;s (r.t., CH2Cl2). Ensuing Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of the trans&#8208;isomer occurred smoothly and produced chiral trans&#8208;fused cycloaddition products (14 examples, 24%&#8211;98% yield). Benzylation led to esters, which were separated by chiral HPLC and which were employed to evaluate a possible enantioselective reaction course. It was discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid with a pendant sensitizing group induces a notable enantioselectivity in the photoisomerization step. The planar chirality of the trans&#8208;cycloheptene translates into point chirality in the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (seven examples, up to 38% ee). Computational studies suggest that the chiral conformation of the cis&#8208;isomer adopted within the assembly to the chiral phosphoric acid induces the enantioselectivity in a one&#8208;bond flip (OBF) toward the trans&#8208;isomer. Trajectory surface hopping (TSH) simulations showed exemplarily how a chiral trans&#8208;cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone is formed from a chiral cis&#8208;conformer. For the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a weak ground state selectivity was found to attenuate the enantioselectivity achieved in the photochemical step.

         <title>Isolation of a Square Pyramidal Bis(amidophenolate)&#8208;Supported As(III)&#8208;Cation: Coordination&#8208;Induced Electromerism at As</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When a bis(amidophenolate)&#8208;supported As(III)&#8208;center is treated with typical two&#8208;electron donors, a coordination&#8208;induced electromerism induces the oxidation of the central atom to As(V) with concomitant reduction of the redox&#8208;active ligand. Due to this triggerable electronic reorganization, the As&#8208;center remains a remarkable Lewis acid and can be used as initiator for transfer hydrogenation reactions. 








Abstract
The synthesis and structural characterization of a slightly distorted square pyramidal arsenium cation is reported. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational evidence indicate that coordination of typical Lewis bases to the As(III)&#8208;center induces its oxidation to As(V) with concomitant reduction of the supporting, redox&#8208;active bis(amidophenolate) ligand. That reaction is reversible and represents a well&#8208;defined example of base&#8208;induced electromerism in an As&#8208;complex. Single electron reduction of the same As(III) species initially generates a ligand&#8208;centered radical, which is persistent enough to be observed by EPR but slowly decays to a heterodimer. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the utility of the As(III)&#8208;cation as initiator for transfer hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>In Situ Light&#8208;driven pH Modulation for NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using light&#8208;activated photoacids. By combining light stimuli with pH&#8208;sensitive molecules, we demonstrate the ability to precisely modulate pH without physically manipulating the sample. This method enables noninvasive pH titration in NMR studies, where pH plays a key role in protein function. Our findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control to overcome existing limitations in NMR, providing a powerful tool for advancing protein research under controlled pH conditions.








Abstract
Proton exchange is a fundamental chemical event, and NMR provides the most direct readout of protonation events with site&#8208;specific resolution. Conventional approaches require manual titration of sample pH to collect a series of NMR spectra at different pH values. This requires extensive sample handling and often results in significant sample loss, leading to reduced signal or the need to prepare additional samples. Here, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using water soluble photoacids, which alters the pH of the solution from near neutral to acidic pH upon in situ photo illumination. We show that the solution pH can be precisely controlled by choice of illumination wavelength and intensity, and sufficient protons are released from the photoacid to achieve meaningful pH change in samples where the molecule of interest has significant buffering capacity, such as a&#160;&gt;100&#160;&#181;M protein sample. The pH is monitored in situ using internal standards with pH&#8208;sensitive chemical shifts. This method enables precise, calibrated, and noninvasive change of sample pH within an NMR magnet, dramatically reducing the necessary sample handling. These findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control in NMR experiments and increase the robustness and reliability of pH&#8208;dependent studies.

         <title>Revealing Transition State Stabilization in Organocatalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Using Data Science</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging a tree&#8208;based learning model, a library of thiourea catalysts were screened with varied substituent electronic characteristics and positions. SHAP analysis reveals the key noncovalent interactions responsible in the transition state, leading to improvement of reactivity without compromising selectivity in organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization.








Abstract
In nature, enzymes leverage constituent amino acid residues to create catalytically active sites to effect high reactivity and selectivity. Multicomponent host&#8211;guest assemblies have been exploited to mimic enzymatic microenvironments by pre&#8208;organizing a network of noncovalent interactions. While organocatalysts such as thioureas have gained widespread success in organic transformation and controlled polymerization, evaluation of the participating structural features in the transition state (TS) remains challenging. Herein, we report the use of data science tools, i.e., a decision&#8208;tree&#8208;based machine&#8208;learning algorithm and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, to model reactivity and regioselectivity in a thiourea&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes. Variation of aryl substituent position and electronic characteristics reveals key catalyst features involved in the TS. The analysis of feature importance helps explain the reason behind the optimal performance of (pseudo)halogen&#8208;substituted catalysts. Furthermore, the structural basis for the unveiled reactivity&#8208;regioselectivity trade&#8208;off in the catalysis are established.

         <title>Hierarchical Optical Waveguides Based on Serpentine&#8208;Like Organic Pseudo&#8208;Plastic Crystals that Mimic Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;plastic organic crystal optical waveguides offer a promising platform for brain&#8208;inspired circuits. A multi&#8208;layered optical waveguide circuit has been developed using (E)&#8208;1&#8208;(((5&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MPyIN) organic crystals that mimic artificial neural networks (ANNs). Fabricated by AFM cantilever tip micromanipulation, the four&#8208;layered structure serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept optical neural network system.








Abstract
Optical components and circuits for signal generation and processing are essential for artificial neural networks (ANNs). We present an interconnected, four&#8208;layered organic crystal optical waveguide architecture that mimics an ANN. This structure is constructed from pseudo&#8208;plastic organic crystals of (E)&#8208;1&#8208;(((5&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MPyIN) using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever tip&#8208;based micromanipulation technique. By strategically selecting four MPyIN crystal waveguides of varying lengths, bending them into serpentine&#8208;like forms, and integrating them hierarchically, we create interconnected, neuron&#8208;like optical waveguides with six optical synapses. These synapses enable parallel transmission of passive optical signals through evanescent coupling across multiple paths within the waveguides. The feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to split the input optical signal into four diverging signals with different magnitudes. Certain outputs deliver mixed passive and active signals due to diverging and converging optical paths. This hierarchical, ANN&#8208;like architecture offers a foundation for developing smart optical neural networks using multiple emissive and phase&#8208;changing organic crystals.

&lt;p&gt;Pseudo-plastic organic crystal optical waveguides offer a promising platform for brain-inspired circuits. A multi-layered optical waveguide circuit has been developed using (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-1-(((5-methylpyridin-2-yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene-2-ol (MPyIN) organic crystals that mimic artificial neural networks (ANNs). Fabricated by AFM cantilever tip micromanipulation, the four-layered structure serves as a proof-of-concept optical neural network system.

         <title>Enhancing Heterointerface Coupling for Durable Industrial&#8208;Level Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a ternary heterostructured catalyst, RuIrOx&#8208;CeO2, featuring a strong&#8208;coupled interface with both electronic and oxygen interaction, which effectively inhibits the active phase separation. The resultant catalyst expresses impressive activity in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers, and demonstrates a stable 2000&#8208;h operation at 5.0 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The industrial&#8208;level application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) lies in the capacity of operating at high current density in order for higher power density and lower operational cost. However, it poses a significant challenge to the overall performance of catalysts. Heterointerface engineering has emerged as an ideal strategy for addressing the anodic intrinsic activity limitations. Nevertheless, due to the fragile interface structure with weak interactions between different components, it is difficult to maintain the high activity and long&#8208;term stability of heterostructured catalysts. Herein, we report a ternary heterostructured catalyst, RuIrOx&#8211;CeO2, featuring a strong&#8208;coupled interface between RuIrOx phase and CeO2 phase. This strong&#8208;coupled interface exhibits both electronic and oxygen interaction, which effectively inhibits the active phase separation. When applied in PEMWE (0.8 mgIr&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the anode and 0.4 mgPt&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the cathode), the resultant catalyst expresses impressive activity, achieving a current density of 3.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.75&#160;V in PEMWE and demonstrates a stable 2000&#8208;h operation at 5.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 with an imperceptible voltage degradation of &lt;1 &#181;V&#160;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Phenol&#8208;Yne Click Polymerization Toward High&#8208;Performance Bioplastics with Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereocontrolled phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization process has been developed for the first time by judiciously changing the substrates, catalysts, and reaction solvents, enabling the construction of a series of structure&#8208;defined, high&#8208;performance, and recyclable click bioplastics.








Abstract
Hydroxyl&#8208;yne click polymerization is a highly atom&#8208;economic and powerful tool for constructing sequence&#8208;controlled and structure&#8208;diverse unsaturated polymers. However, the cis/trans stereochemistry remains underdeveloped, thus lacking a stereodivergent synthesis of stereocontrolled polymers. Herein, we first report the organocatalyzed stereocontrolled phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization of bioderived diphenols and dipropiolates by judiciously changing the substrates, catalysts, and reaction solvents. Various sequence&#8208; and stereocontrolled poly(vinyl ether ester)s were effectively synthesized under mild reaction conditions, in which the trans content in the polymeric backbone can be proportionally altered in the range of 46%&#8211;100%. More importantly, the bulk properties of these materials such as thermal (Td,5% of 329&#8211;362 &#176;C; Tg of 48&#8211;92 &#176;C), mechanical (ultimate tensile strengths of 41&#8211;89&#160;MPa, tensile moduli of 960&#8211;1991&#160;MPa, and elongations at break of 71%&#8211;242%), and transport properties (oxygen transmission rates of 0.2&#8211;0.3&#160;bar and water vapor transmission rates of 1.3&#8211;2.8&#160;g mm m&#8722;2 day&#8722;1) can be tuned broadly. Moreover, the installed dynamic acetal moieties contribute to the excellent degradability and recyclability of these materials. This study provides an efficient and sustainable strategy for synthesizing stereoregulated biopolymers with closed&#8208;loop recyclability, thereby expanding the chemical diversity of click polymers with structure&#8208;controlled and tailored properties.

         <title>Oxygen Atom Migration Dominates Anomalous Reversible Oxidation of Ru Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the common perception that metal oxidation is a unidirectional process, the oxidation of Ru nanosheets is reversible under oxidative conditions. This reversibility originates from the ability of O atoms to &#8220;flow&#8221; across Ru layers, which serves as the underlying mechanism for the incomplete oxidation of Ru nanosheets.








Abstract
Oxidation is a ubiquitous reaction in nature. For most metals (especially metal nanoparticles [NPs]), they will be completely oxidized under suitable conditions, except ruthenium (Ru). In this work, in situ transmission electron microscopy (in situ TEM) and ex situ spectroscopy were employed to investigate the oxidation process of Ru nanosheets. Ex situ spectroscopic analysis demonstrates the incomplete oxidation of Ru nanosheets to RuO&#8322;, while the in situ TEM observations uncover an anomalous reverse phase transformation from the oxidized to metallic phase during oxidation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the oxygen atom migration dominates the reversible oxidation process, strikingly distinct from the unidirectional oxidation pathways in conventional metallic systems. The as&#8208;generated abundant Ru&#9472;RuO2 heterointerfaces formed through reversible oxidation provide a wealth of active sites for electrochemical alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the study not only lays a foundation for the understanding complex dynamic oxidation processes, but also offers new insights into the design of nanocatalysts.

         <title>Stabilizing Surface Lattice On&#8722; (0&#160;&lt;&#160;n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) for Long&#8208;Term Durability of LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs spinel and RS phases on the surface of LCO cathodes (named S&#8208;LCO and R&#8208;LCO). The spinel phase of S&#8208;LCO degrades during long&#8208;term cycling due to lattice On&#8722; (0&#160;&lt;&#160;n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) loss, while the RS phase of R&#8208;LCO remains stable due to its higher lattice On&#8722; migration barriers. This study clarifies the mechanism of enhancing lattice On&#8722; stability via phase tailoring, providing a basis for designing advanced LCO cathodes.








Abstract
The instability of surface lattice On&#8722; (0&#160;&lt;&#160;n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) in charged LiCoO&#8322; (LCO) limits its long&#8208;term cycling stability beyond 4.55&#160;V versus Li/Li&#8314;. Herein, the spinel and rock&#8208;salt (RS) phases are constructed on LCO surface to stabilize lattice On&#8722;, namely S&#8208;LCO and R&#8208;LCO, respectively. Upon long&#8208;term cycling at 4.6&#160;V, the loss of lattice On&#8722; leads to a progressive deterioration of surface spinel phase, which ultimately transforms into a strong Li+&#8208;blocking phase. In contrast, for R&#8208;LCO, the surface lattice On&#8722; in the RS phase remains stable in long&#8208;term cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that the migration barriers of lattice On&#8722; are significantly higher in the RS phase than in the spinel phase. Due to the stabilized surface lattice On&#8722;, the R&#8208;LCO||Li cell shows an impressive capacity retention of 78.6% after 1000 cycles at 4.6&#160;V (at 1C rate) and superior floating charge durability at 45 &#176;C. This study highlights the importance of surface structure tailoring in developing advanced LCO cathodes.

     alt="Stabilizing Surface Lattice On&#8722; (0&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;n&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;2) for Long-Term Durability of LiCoO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work constructs spinel and RS phases on the surface of LCO cathodes (named S-LCO and R-LCO). The spinel phase of S-LCO degrades during long-term cycling due to lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (0&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;2) loss, while the RS phase of R-LCO remains stable due to its higher lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; migration barriers. This study clarifies the mechanism of enhancing lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; stability via phase tailoring, providing a basis for designing advanced LCO cathodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instability of surface lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (0&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;2) in charged LiCoO&#8322; (LCO) limits its long-term cycling stability beyond 4.55&#160;V versus Li/Li&#8314;. Herein, the spinel and rock-salt (RS) phases are constructed on LCO surface to stabilize lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, namely S-LCO and R-LCO, respectively. Upon long-term cycling at 4.6&#160;V, the loss of lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; leads to a progressive deterioration of surface spinel phase, which ultimately transforms into a strong Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-blocking phase. In contrast, for R-LCO, the surface lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the RS phase remains stable in long-term cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that the migration barriers of lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are significantly higher in the RS phase than in the spinel phase. Due to the stabilized surface lattice O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the R-LCO||Li cell shows an impressive capacity retention of 78.6% after 1000 cycles at 4.6&#160;V (at 1C rate) and superior floating charge durability at 45 &#176;C. This study highlights the importance of surface structure tailoring in developing advanced LCO cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Biofilm Scaffold for Structurally Adaptative Slippery Surfaces with Integrated Antifouling and Anticorrosion Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept derived from biofilm scaffolds is proposed to develop universal, flexible, and multifunctional nonstick coatings with autophobicity. These cohesive biofilms acting as structurally adaptive sheets enable scalable and substrate&#8208;independent self&#8208;cleaning capabilities without compromising transparency and mechanical stability. This coating significantly enhances corrosion resistance and prevents a broad spectrum of biofouling attachments.








Abstract
Artificial liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are highly desirable to combat pervasive biofouling and corrosion in biological environments. However, existing strategies often suffer from slow binding kinetics and harsh fabrication conditions, hindering the concurrent integration of liquid repellency, universal adhesion, and robust flexibility. Herein, we report that it is possible to engineer microbial biofilms as eco&#8208;friendly, cohesive, and flexible materials for omniphobic slippery coatings fulfilling all these requirements. Unlike conventional synthetic slippery coatings requiring laborious surface pretreatments, biofilm sheets formed on demand assemble a durable nanotextured framework on diverse substrates with multiple material categories and surface topologies, serving as hydrophobic lubricant reservoirs. Employing this renewable material enables the scalable and sustainable coating production. The resulting optically transparent and highly flexible coatings manifest exceptional self&#8208;cleaning properties, readily shedding both waterborne and oily liquids over a broad viscosity range. Notably, the synergy between the corrosion&#8208;protective extracellular matrix and nonstick slipping motion confers unprecedented antibiofouling efficacy and corrosion resistance. This study offers a distinctive perspective on harnessing ubiquitous native biofilms as biomaterials for self&#8208;adaptive coatings, facilitating tailored functionality across broad applications.

The Claisen&#8211;Esters&#8208;Condensation Reaction between &#945;&#8208;H and lithium metal as the degradation origin between carboxylate and lithium metal. Molecular engineering of &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;free ethyl trifluoroacetate (ETFA) and ethyl trimethylacetate (ETMA) enables complete suppression of chemical corrosion, construct anion&#8208;rich electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) enabling dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition and practical battery performance.








Abstract
Although carboxylate esters greatly improve the cold weather performance of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilized in arctic expeditions, the underlying cause of the incompatibility between carboxylates and lithium (Li) anodes has not been sufficiently explained, resulting in the greatly restricted usage of carboxylate in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we reveal the serious parasitic reactions between carboxylate &#945;&#8208;H atoms and Li metal are the culprits that render carboxylate&#8208;based ineffectiveness for LMBs. By replacing all &#945;&#8208;H atoms with fluorine atoms and methyl groups, we successfully construct inert carboxylates and find the ions/molecules distribution in electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) can be manipulated at a molecular&#8208;level. The unique structure ensuring more anions are positioned closer to the Li surface in the EDL of the inert carboxylate&#8208;based electrolyte, the morphology of the deposited Li is significantly regulated and the chemical corrosion gets effectively inhibited, as a consequence of remarkable extending lifespan of carboxylate&#8208;based LMBs with routine salt concentration and few additives. More generally, using carboxylates lacking &#945;&#8208;H atoms offer a realistic approach to increase the variety of solvents that can be used in LMBs electrolytes.

         <title>Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Engineered by Catalysis Chemistry Toward Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis chemistry strategy was applied to construct a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing the sodium dendrites growth and enhancing the reversibility of sodium plating/stripping toward advanced anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are considered one of the most promising large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their extremely high energy density. Nonetheless, their practical application is hindered by the uncontrolled growth of sodium dendrites. Constructing a mechanically robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite formation. Herein, we report a catalysis chemistry approach to construct an ultra&#8208;thin (&#8764; 5&#160;nm), NaF&#8208;rich and high&#8208;strength (203&#160;MPa) SEI layer by introducing Ru catalytic sites on the current collector, which promotes rapid Na&#8314; diffusion and effectively inhibits dendrite growth. Benefiting from this design, the Ru modified&#8208;Cu//Na asymmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability over 2000&#160;h (1000 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 2 mAh cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, the AFSMBs with Ru modified&#8208;Cu current collector also deliver excellent cycling performance and maintains nearly 98.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The results demonstrate great potential of catalysis chemistry in developing advanced sodium metal anodes and provide a new perspective to engineering efficient SEI toward battery applications.

         <title>Prebiotic Interconversion of Pyruvate and Lactate over Zeolite&#8208;Supported Ni Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni mineral can catalyze the interconversion of metabolically crucial pyruvate and lactate under hydrothermal vent conditions, which could pave the way for the modern biological process by lactate dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.








Abstract
Submarine hydrothermal vents harbor diverse microbial communities and have long intrigued researchers studying the origin of life. Transition metals in these environments can be reduced by serpentinization, potentially forming zeolite&#8208;supported transition metal nanoparticles capable of driving prebiotic chemistry. This inorganic structure could catalyze biochemical reactions, including converting metabolically crucial pyruvate before the emergence of biological processes. This study explores the catalytic interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, mediated by lactate dehydrogenase in biochemical systems, using inorganic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni nanoparticles (Ni/Y) under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Our results demonstrate that Ni/Y effectively catalyzes the hydrogenation of pyruvate in an inert environment, facilitated by the in situ generation of H&#8322; through an autocatalytic reaction between Ni/Y and H&#8322;O. Post&#8208;reaction analysis by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed structural transformations in the catalyst, including the formation of unique nickel oxide and hydroxide species, along with extra&#8208;framework aluminum from zeolite dealumination, resulting in a thin amorphous nickel oxide/hydroxide layer. Notably, Ni/Y also enables the oxidative reconversion of lactate to pyruvate under atmospheric conditions&#8212;an essential reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in biological systems. These findings underscore the potential prebiotic role of Ni/Y, suggesting they may have catalyzed the synthesis of key metabolic intermediates.

Our results demonstrate that Ni/Y effectively catalyzes the hydrogenation of pyruvate in an inert environment, facilitated by the in situ generation of H&#8322; through an autocatalytic reaction between Ni/Y and H&#8322;O. Post-reaction analysis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed structural transformations in the catalyst, including the formation of unique nickel oxide and hydroxide species, along with extra-framework aluminum from zeolite dealumination, resulting in a thin amorphous nickel oxide/hydroxide layer. Notably, Ni/Y also enables the oxidative reconversion of lactate to pyruvate under atmospheric conditions&#8212;an essential reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in biological systems. These findings underscore the potential prebiotic role of Ni/Y, suggesting they may have catalyzed the synthesis of key metabolic intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Adhesion/Detachment Using Layered Polymers with Light&#8208;Induced Rapid Shape Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geckos achieve rapid adhesion and detachment through their hierarchically structured toe pads. Inspired by this, we developed a crosslinked polymer film with a nanoscale layered structure that undergoes high&#8208;speed, reversible expansion, and contraction under UV light. This allows remote&#8208;controlled adhesion switching, enabling rapid object pick&#8208;up and release. This work offers insights into smart adhesives for soft robotics and object transport.








Abstract
Geckos achieve rapid and efficient adhesion and detachment on various surfaces within milliseconds due to the hierarchically structured fibrillar architecture of their toe pads. Extensive research has focused on developing adhesive materials that mimic these micro&#8208;nano structures. However, no conventional adhesives have matched the performance of their natural counterparts, which are both non&#8208;degrading and self&#8208;cleaning. Here, we develop a chemically crosslinked polymer film with a nanoscale layered structure that exhibits high&#8208;speed switching of&#160;mechanical&#160;motions (expansion and contraction) in equation both forward and reverse directions through controlled ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Under UV light on/off switching, the film shows reversable shape changes in the direction perpendicular to the molecular alignment. These photoresponsive molecular movements in the film is demonstrated for remote control in a smart adhesion system with rapid responsiveness and high reproducibility. The films respond to UV light to release picked&#8208;up objects and immediately regain their adhesion when the UV light ceases. Additionally, we propose the working principles and mechanisms of these reusable adhesive films, providing new insights into the development of smart soft materials. The material's rapid deformation, high responsiveness, and flexibility make it a promising candidate for light&#8208;controlled object transport and remote&#8208;controlled robotics.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doping Engineering of Fused Olympic Cations: Metal&#8208;Free Modular Syntheses and NIR&#8208;II Radicals with Mixed Aromatic/Antiaromatic Characters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of nitrogen and sulfur/oxygen dual&#8208;doping Olympic heterocyclic cations have been modularly synthesized employing a metal&#8208;free protocol, with tunable optical and redox properties. These charged &#960;&#8208;molecules can transform to delocalized neutral radicals through single&#8208;electron reduction, exhibiting NIR&#8208;II absorptions around 1300&#8211;1400&#160;nm and mixed aromatic/antiaromatic features.








Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have attracted immense attention owing to their fascinating optoelectrical properties. However, precise heteroatom&#8208;doping engineering and fabricating charged polycyclic aromatic scaffolds remain challenging and far from satisfactory. Herein, a new family of nitrogen and sulfur/oxygen dual&#8208;doping fused Olympic heterocyclic cations (FPT/FPOs) are modularly synthesized employing an efficient and convenient metal&#8208;free protocol. Tunable optical and redox properties can be achieved by rational structural editing. Compared with their half&#8208;fused counterparts, FPTs and FPOs hold higher redox stability and can undergo single&#8208;electron reduction to form delocalized neutral radicals, exhibiting NIR&#8208;II absorptions around 1300&#8211;1400&#160;nm and unexpected mixed aromatic/antiaromatic characters. It is anticipated that this line of research provides a new approach for heteroatom&#8208;doping engineering and constructing novel charged &#960;&#8208;molecules, with deeper insights into their redox&#8208;amphoteric features and aromaticity manipulation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Self&#8208;Fenton Reaction Mediated by Silver Single Atom and Cluster Photocatalysts for Highly Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen Toward Efficient Organic Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic pollutants in wastewater were efficiently removed by silver single&#8208;atom and cluster&#8208;doped ZnO (AgSA&#8211;AgC/ZnO) through the &#183;OOH&#8208;mediated in&#8208;situ H2O2 heterolytic cleavage pathway to highly selectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2) via a photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction system. The benzene ring&#8208;opening and dechlorination&#160;reactions via the 1O2 oxidation route at Ag&#8208;SA sites and the reactive H* reduction pathway at Ag&#8208;cluster sites, respectively, are proposed for the p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation. 








Abstract
The persistent organic pollutants in wastewater have caused a heavy threat to ecosystems and humans, but selective removal of these pollutants still faces challenges due to low efficiency, extra addition of oxidation agents, and many highly toxic intermediate products. Herein, we report an efficient, fast kinetic conversion via a photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system of *OOH intermediate&#8208;involved oxidation pathway with a high selection generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from the novel in situ H2O2 heterolytic activation route for the first time. The single&#8208;atom and cluster&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AgSA&#8211;AgC/ZnO) was successfully synthesized to achieve the 100% degradation yield and 80% total of carbon (TOC) of the p&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP) as the typical pollutant under solar&#8208;light irradiation and exhibit long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;designed photo&#8208;Filter reactor for 4&#8208;CP degradation. It was attributed to the accelerated cycles from Aghigh&#948;+ site to Aglow&#948;+ site in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis, achieving the rapid selection conversion from the H2O2 heterolytic cleavage to &#8764;100% 1O2 via the intermediate *OOH at the Ag SA sites for ring&#8208;opening reaction and reactive H* at the Ag clusters sites for dechlorination reaction, respectively. This discovery gives the deep understanding of the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction through in situ cycles of variable metals for the organic contaminants treatment.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Activating Polydimethylsiloxane&#8208;Modified CrOx/Al2O3 Catalyst for Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wobble effect of flexible polydimethylsiloxane chain protects catalyst surface from the coke precursors generated during acetylene semihydrogenation, thus extending the lifetime of CrOx/Al2O3 over 40&#8208;fold. This work highlights the importance of dynamic self&#8208;activation in the catalytic reactions suffering from carbonaceous deposition issues.








Abstract
Biomimetic approach is a nature&#8208;driven strategy for designing functional materials to meet the industrial challenges. Here we demonstrate the bio&#8208;inspired discovery of a self&#8208;activating catalyst, with polydimethylsiloxane anchored over the surface of CrOx/Al2O3, exhibiting comparable performance with noble metallic catalysts for acetylene semihydrogenation. In addition, the dynamic movement of polymer chains with high flexibility renders the catalyst to impose proactive perturbation to the undesired coke precursors generated in reaction, analogous to the function of hair&#8208;like cilia on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells, thus avoiding the site&#8208;blocking induced by carbonaceous deposits and sustaining the catalyst stable for 1000&#160;h without any deactivation. This study paves the way to develop other heterogeneous catalysts with high efficiency and durability via mimicking the innate defense mechanism of natural organisms.

         <title>Electronic Structure Tuning in Cu&#8211;Co Dual Single Atom Catalysts for Enhanced COOH* Spillover and Electrocalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;Co dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (CuCo&#8208;DSAC) synergistically enhance CO2 electroreduction to CO by tuning electronic structure and facilitating COOH* spillover. The (Cu, Co)&#8208;COOH* buffer system broadens the potential window, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 98.5%. This study provides mechanistic insights into dual&#8208;atom catalysis and establishes a design strategy for scalable, efficient CO2RR catalysts.








Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO is challenging due to competing hydrogen evolution and intermediate over&#8208;stabilization. In this study, a Cu&#8211;Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (CuCo&#8208;DSAC) anchored on carbon black was synthesized via scalable pyrolysis. The catalyst achieves 98.5% CO Faradaic efficiency at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, maintaining&#160;&gt;&#160;95% selectivity across a 400&#160;mV window with&#160;&lt;&#160;6% decay over 48&#160;h, which is superior to the corresponding single&#8208;atom control samples. In situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a synergistic mechanism: Co sites activate CO2 and stabilize *COOH intermediates, while adjacent Cu sites facilitate CO desorption by lowering the energy barrier through charge redistribution. This dynamic buffer system mitigates active&#8208;site blocking and suppresses HER by weakening H adsorption. The electronic interplay between Cu and Co optimizes intermediate energetics, enabling industrial&#8208;level performance. This work demonstrates the potential of tailored dual&#8208;site architectures for complex electrocatalytic processes, offering a promising approach to overcoming traditional limitations.

         <title>Environmental History is Transferred via Minerals Altering Formose Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the influence of minerals on the formose reaction. We found that different minerals have distinct impact on the network outcome effects, that change over sequential batch reactions, demonstrating a history effect. Finally, we show that when minerals are first incubated with the aqueous catalysts, they subsequently allow for formation of formose products without the need for an aqueous catalyst.








Abstract
It is generally accepted that minerals were an important source of prebiotic catalysis. In this work we demonstrate how the prebiotic sugar forming formose reaction is guided to unique reaction compositions in the presence of a variety of minerals. When the same mineral is transferred between multiple sequential batch reactions, a new reaction composition is obtained after each reaction cycle. We attribute this effect to the adsorption of catalytic Ca(OH)2 to mineral surfaces. Further exploration shows that first exposing the mineral surface to the aqueous catalyst allows the mineral to subsequently produce formose outputs without the need for any additional catalyst to be present. As such, the mineral surface functions as storage of the preceding environmental conditions. Our work supports the development of chemical complexity through the transfer of information between sequences of chemical environments.

         <title>Potassium Tetraiodatoiodate(III) Iodate(V): A Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Exceptional Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Full&#8208;Wavelength Phase Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel potassium tetraiodatoiodate(III) iodate(V), K2[IIII(IVO3)4]IVO3, has been successfully synthesized via an innovative in&#8208;situ reduction and complexation reaction. This atypical inorganic nonmetallic coordination compound, featuring trivalent iodine as the central coordination atom, exhibits exceptional potential as a second&#8208;order nonlinear optical material. It demonstrates remarkable second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (21.6KH2PO4 at 1064&#160;nm, 1.0KTiOPO4 at 2050&#160;nm), a broad transparency range from the visible to the mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths (0.37&#8211;6.05 and 7.03&#8211;13.40&#160;&#181;m), and a high birefringence (0.358 at 543&#160;nm) enabling rare full&#8208;wavelength phase matching.








Abstract
The development of nonlinear optical materials with large nonlinear optical susceptibilities, wide transmission ranges, and comprehensive full&#8208;wavelength phase matching capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized a novel potassium tetraiodatoiodate(III) iodate(V) via an in&#8208;situ reduction and complexation reaction. The resulting compound, K2[IIII(IVO3)4]IVO3, exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (21.6KH2PO4 at 1064&#160;nm, 1.0KTiOPO4 at 2050&#160;nm), a wide transparency range from the visible to the mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths (0.37&#8211;6.05 and 7.03&#8211;13.40&#160;&#181;m), and a high birefringence (0.358 at 543&#160;nm) to achieve full&#8208;wavelength phase matching. These properties are primarily ascribed to the synergistic substantial hyperpolarizability and polarizability anisotropy exhibited by the [IIII(IVO3)4]&#8722; complex ions, which comprise square&#8208;planar coordinated trivalent iodine and optimally arranged iodate ligands. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of nonmetallic cation centered coordination entities in influencing linear and nonlinear optical properties, a discovery that has significant implications for the development of innovative inorganic functional materials.

         <title>Probing Inside the Catalyst Layer on Gas Diffusion Electrodes in Electrochemical Reduction of CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ confocal Raman spectroscopy technique is developed to probe the cross&#8208;section of catalyst layers in gas diffusion electrodes during CO(2) reduction reactions. For CORR in alkaline medium, the active region is identified by CO adsorption bands. In CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, CS&#8208;Raman spectroscopy reveals that only regions with elevated pH are active.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are widely used in electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CO(2)RR) in flow cells due to their ability to alleviate mass transport limitations of gaseous reactants. The flow cell configuration makes uniform distribution of reactants, intermediates, products, and speciation within the catalyst layer (CL) unlikely. In this work, a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ characterization technique capable of probing the cross section of the CL with confocal Raman spectroscopy was developed to investigate the speciation distribution across the Cu CL in CO(2)RR with a spatial resolution of &#8764;4&#160;&#181;m. In both CORR in alkaline medium and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, the active region of CL was identified as that with the presence of the Raman band for adsorbed CO (COad). The strong correlation of COad and CO32&#8722; bands provides the first spectroscopic evidence that CO2RR only occurs in an alkaline microenvironment.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Concentrated Formate via CO2 Electrolysis Integrated with Cl2 Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilized two automated pH regulation strategies to integrate cathodic CO2 electrolysis with anodic Cl2 formation in scalable cation exchange membrane&#8208;based electrolyzers. Our process achieved formate concentrations exceeding 5&#160;M during extended operations, establishing a new benchmark for electrochemical formate synthesis.








Abstract
Integrating CO2 electrolysis with an industrially relevant anodic reaction enhances the economic feasibility and reduces carbon emissions in practical operations. In this study, we present an electrosynthesis strategy that integrates the CO2 reduction reaction to produce concentrated formate solution with the Cl2 formation in cation exchange membrane&#8208;based electrolyzers, scaling from 1 to 100 cm2 electrode areas. Our process, equipped with two automated pH regulation strategies, achieved selectivities over 80% for formate and 95% for chlorine in a 25 cm2 electrolyzer. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to achieve formate concentrations up to 5.4&#160;M during extended operation periods, establishing a new benchmark for electrochemical formate/formic acid synthesis. Techno&#8208;economic assessment and life cycle assessment further validated the process' sustainability, demonstrating a realistic path to profitability for valuable chemical production from CO2 even without considering potential subsidies and carbon taxes.

         <title>Molecularly Designed Cathode for Copper&#8208;Benzimidazole&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction to MeOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular cathode incorporating a strategically designed copper&#8208;benzimidazole&#8208;based electrocatalyst was developed for direct CO&#8322; capture and electrochemical conversion to methanol (e&#8208;MeOH). This system follows a formato pathway, utilizing water as a proton source and thus eliminating the need for H&#8322; in e&#8208;MeOH production. The mechanism of methanol formation has been investigated by DFT calculations. The electrode's stability and recyclability were thoroughly evaluated through multiple controlled potential electrolysis experiments.








Abstract
Conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) into value&#8208;added products is aimed to develop scalable technologies to promote a circular economy. While the electrochemical reduction of CO&#8322; to carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid has advanced significantly, a major challenge remains achieving further reduced and more energy&#8208;dense products, such as methanol (MeOH), through sustainable pathways. Herein, we report a molecular electrode capable of direct six&#8208;electron reduction of CO&#8322; to MeOH using water as a proton source with a global Faradaic efficiency (FEG) of 22% and product selectivity of 61% for MeOH. The design consists of an active copper&#8208;hydride center surrounded by two closely spaced benzimidazole&#8211;hydride units, facilitating the catalytic transfer of three hydrides to produce MeOH. The concurrent formation of formic acid and the absence of formaldehyde suggest that MeOH is generated via a formato pathway. DFT investigations revealed the complete mechanistic pathway, which supports the experimental observations. The morphology and stability of the electrode were evaluated before and after prolonged electrolysis (12&#160;h) experiments using electron microscopic techniques.

         <title>Blocking the Operando Formation of Single&#8208;Atom Spectators by Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redispersion of Pt ensembles and the formation of single&#8208;atom species are key factors in the deactivation of CeO2&#8208;supported Pt catalysts for propane oxidation. We propose an interfacial engineering strategy using NbOx to block binding sites for Pt on CeO2, directing Pt clusters to optimal locations without direct contact. This approach prevents redispersion, enabling active Pt nanoclusters to efficiently dissociate C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in a 37&#8208;fold increase in reaction rate and enhanced stability. 








Abstract
Aside from activity and selectivity, catalyst stability is a key focus in heterogeneous catalysis research. Although sintering of metal species has been considered the primary cause for deactivation of metal catalysts, our study reveals that the loss of activity at low reaction temperatures in the CeO2&#8208;supported Pt (Pt/CeO2) catalyst in complete propane oxidation is due to the dispersion of Pt ensemble sites (nanoclusters) and their subsequent operando conversion into Pt single atoms under reaction conditions. These Pt single&#8208;atom species exhibit low reactivity and act as spectators in the low&#8208;temperature reaction region. To address this issue, we engineered the surface of CeO2 by introducing NbOx, which does not directly interact with Pt. Instead, NbOx blocks the strong binding sites for Pt on CeO2, thereby preventing Pt redispersion/fragmentation and preserving reactive Pt ensembles. This strategy led to a remarkable 37&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate compared to the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Our findings emphasize the importance of suppressing the formation of noble metal single&#8208;atom spectators through innovative surface engineering strategy. These mechanistic insights not only advance the understanding of the materials science of Pt/CeO2 but also extend to critical technological fields such as energy conversion systems and environmental remediation technologies.

         <title>Interweaved Nanofiber Anode Coating Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework helical nanofibers obtained through the assembly of non&#8208;linear oxalyldihydrazide unit and rigid Cu3 unit has been successfully fabricated into interweaved porous anode coating for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;metal batteries call for unique interfacial structures of anode with interfacial compatibility, facilitated lithium insertion/extraction and dendrite suppression properties to meet the growing high&#8208;rate demand. Here, we develop an interweaved porous coating based on a kind of covalent organic framework (ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF) based helical nanofibers through the assembly of non&#8208;linear oxalyldihydrazide unit and rigid Cu3 unit. The interweaved helical nanofibers network with well&#8208;arranged polar groups (i.e., C&#9552;N, &#9472;CO&#9472;NH&#9472;, and pyrazole groups) could serve as nuclei sites to achieve fast Li+ insertion/extraction and dendrite suppression in high&#8208;rate conditions. Benefiting from the advantages of interface design, the resultant ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF modified anode improves the Coulombic efficiency (97.5%, 120 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and showcases a stable lifespan (1000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cell. Moreover, the high&#8208;rate property of ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF@Li||LFP full cell presents an excellent cycling stability (900 cycles at 5 C) in commercial carbonate electrolyte. Theoretical calculations reveal that lithiophilic ODH&#9472;Cu3&#9472;COF has high Li affinity to reduce the nucleation barrier and achieve fast desolvation process in an interface to promote the lifespan of high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halides have the advantages of high luminous efficiency and adjustable optical properties. However, there are no reports about organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halide glass. Herein, a hybrid rare earth halide glass Bzmim3LnCl6 (Bzmim&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole; Ln3+ = Tb3+, Eu3+) was prepared using a low&#8208;temperature melt quenching method to achieve multicolor luminescence under ultraviolet and X&#8208;rays.








Abstract
Rare earth&#8211;based all&#8208;inorganic glass&#8208;ceramics have played an important role in the field of optoelectronics. However, the research of organo&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halide glass that can be produced at low temperatures is still in the blank stage. In this paper, we report for the first time novel amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth&#8211;based halide luminescent glasses, Bzmim3LnCl6 (Bzmim&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium; Ln3+ = Tb3+, Eu3+), and realize tunable multicolor photoluminescence emission. By adjusting the ratio of Tb3+/Eu3+ within the Bzmim3LnCl6 glass, we have successfully induced controllable radioluminescence properties ranging from green to red under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Notably, these amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth glasses exhibit remarkable sensitivity to variations in X&#8208;ray dose, suggesting promising applications in the field of passive color visualization radiation detection. Furthermore, the Bzmim3TbCl6 glass demonstrates exceptional light transmittance greater than 85% across the 480&#8211;800&#160;nm range, which results in superior spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging (&gt;25 lp mm&#8722;1). These findings not only provide a good example for the design and development of hybrid rare earth&#8211;based halide glasses but also hold great potential for applications in detection, sensing, illumination, and display technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halides have the advantages of high luminous efficiency and adjustable optical properties. However, there are no reports about organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halide glass. Herein, a hybrid rare earth halide glass Bzmim&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (Bzmim&#160;=&#160;1-benzyl-3-methylimidazole; Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; = Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) was prepared using a low-temperature melt quenching method to achieve multicolor luminescence under ultraviolet and X-rays.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare earth&#8211;based all-inorganic glass-ceramics have played an important role in the field of optoelectronics. However, the research of organo&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth halide glass that can be produced at low temperatures is still in the blank stage. In this paper, we report for the first time novel amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth&#8211;based halide luminescent glasses, Bzmim&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (Bzmim&#160;=&#160;1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium; Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; = Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), and realize tunable multicolor photoluminescence emission. By adjusting the ratio of Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; within the Bzmim&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; glass, we have successfully induced controllable radioluminescence properties ranging from green to red under X-ray irradiation. Notably, these amorphous organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare earth glasses exhibit remarkable sensitivity to variations in X-ray dose, suggesting promising applications in the field of passive color visualization radiation detection. Furthermore, the Bzmim&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; glass demonstrates exceptional light transmittance greater than 85% across the 480&#8211;800&#160;nm range, which results in superior spatial resolution in X-ray imaging (&amp;gt;25 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Avoiding the Kauzmann Paradox via Interface&#8208;Driven Divergence in States (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 23/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexity in surfaces due to compositional self&#8208;organization generates a thermodynamic stress tensor that stretches the phase landscape, realizing previously inaccessible relaxation pathways. This surface driven control over thermodynamic speed limit and momentum creates a potential resolution for the Kauzmann paradox through divergence in entropy. More information can be found in the Research article by Martin Thuo, Andrew Martin, and Jason R. Green (e202502197).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Hydrogen Binding Energy Is Insufficient for Describing Hydrogen Evolution on Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 23/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their Research Article Hao Li and co&#8208;workers (e202425402) resolve a long&#8208;standing question on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors. Especially, poisoning is an essential consideration in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). When the metal sites are poisoned, the N sites of SACs may become new active centers. Most importantly, by combining H binding energy with HO binding energy, a more effective way to predict the HER performance of SACs is offered. This approach provides new guidance for catalyst design.

A non&#8208;carbonization method for Pd SAC preparation using N&#8208;functionalized lignin&#8208;based phenolic resins as supports is presented by Chuanling Si and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202503195). This approach enables the cross&#8208;linking of lignin, phenol and formaldehyde to form a unique network structure that provides abundant Pd&#8208;N coordination sites and facilitates the adsorption of &#9472;CHO, making it possible to efficiently catalyze the conversion of various lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes.

This review highlights how computational modeling approaches can provide insights into the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships, helping to rationalize the molecular design for applications in the fields of biorecognition, catalysis, and self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Inspired by the exquisite properties emerging from the sequence order in nucleic acids and proteins, researchers are increasingly considering synthetic sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules (SDMs) to reach precise functions, e.g. for catalysis, data storage, energy, and health. Although researchers develop iterative techniques permitting the synthesis of perfectly defined sequences, there is still an important gap to achieve the desired properties leading to their utilization as materials. This arises from the fact that the effect of the sequence order on the 3D structure is unknown for most current synthetic SDMs. Although the Protein Data Bank gathers hundreds of thousands of elucidated 3D structures of proteins, and many more computed (using, e.g., AlphaFold), extended information on sequence&#8208;structure relationships does not exist yet for synthetic SDMs. To tackle this problem for relatively flexible synthetic macromolecules, one can nowadays utilize the existing tools of molecular modeling simulations. In this review, we report an advanced practice to reveal the 3D structures and the interactions, through the combination of all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis applied to different types of SDMs. By combining the computational results to the experimental ones, we show the potential of this approach for an in&#8208;depth understanding of the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete macromolecular systems, toward guiding their rational design for specific functions.

         <title>Fluid Chemistry of Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluid chemistry provides effective strategies to investigate fluid behavior and stability, internal crystallization, and interfacial reaction in metal halide perovskites, with an emphasis on the improvement methods and underlying chemical mechanisms. A fundamental understanding of phase transition mechanisms enables the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films, enhancing the performance of perovskite modules and accelerating their industrial application. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been rapidly developed worldwide, with much attention to fluid dynamic, fluid crystallization, and fluid interfaces, all falling within the realm of fluid chemistry. It is widely recognized that the theory of fluid chemistry has been proven to provide an effective means for the improvement of perovskite crystallization and the enhancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) performance. In this review, the fluid behavior, microfluidic synthesis, and aging process of perovskite materials are first investigated, with emphasis on the related improvement methods and chemical mechanisms. Second, the internal crystallization chemistry, external interface chemistry, and the large&#8208;area PSCs based on the fluid chemistry are discussed. Finally, four specific directions for future studies of fluid chemistry of MHPs are proposed, aiming to harness the theoretical advantages of fluid chemistry and contribute to the industrialization of PSCs.

         <title>Isolated and Paired Metal Sites in Zeolites Using Solid&#8208;State Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal ions housed in the zeolitic micropore are broadly applied in catalysis. These model active sites provide a link between homogeneous, enzyme, and solid catalysts. The synthetic strategy used to generate these cationic sites has a significant influence on the catalytic activity. Here, we discuss an emerging synthesis technique, solid&#8208;state ion exchange, and its application in pursuit of isolated and paired metal sites within the confines of the zeolite.








Abstract
Isolated and paired extraframework transition metal cations in zeolites are emerging as top candidates for numerous applications, including, but not limited to, selective methane oxidation to methanol, selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, propane dehydrogenation, propylene epoxidation, and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Importantly, these well&#8208;defined heterogeneous catalysts offer parallels with molecular and metalloenzyme catalytic active sites. Aqueous&#8208;phase ion exchange (APIE) is the most common synthesis technique to obtain these catalysts. Solid&#8208;state ion exchange (SSIE) is an often overlooked technique that offers synthetic advantages compared to APIE. Thus, recent advances in solid&#8208;state synthesis strategies merit contemporary contextualization. In this minireview, we describe the basic principles, methods, mechanisms, challenges, and advances in&#160;solid&#8208;state ion exchange in the context of&#160;well&#8208;defined transition metal cation&#160;active sites located in extraframework positions of the zeolite.

         <title>Linkages Chemistry of Covalent Organic Frameworks in Photocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the linkage chemistry of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in fields of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. With different linkages, the relationship between linkages and properties was summarized. The insights into the further development of design strategies and applications based on COFs with different linkages.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis applications due to their structurally ordered architectures and tunable physicochemical properties. In COFs, organic building blocks are linked via covalent bonds, and the structural and electronic characteristics of COFs are critically governed by their linkage chemistry. These linkages influence essential material attributes including surface area, crystallinity, hydrophobicity, chemical stability, and the optoelectronic behavior (e.g., photoelectron separation efficiency, electron conductivity, and reductive activity), which collectively determine catalytic performance in energy conversion systems. A systematic understanding of linkage engineering in COFs not only advances synthetic methodologies but also provides innovative solutions to global energy and environmental challenges, thereby accelerating the development of sustainable technologies for clean energy production and environmental remediation.

         <title>Introducing the Aziridination of Fluorinated Olefins by Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic system for the aziridination of fluorinated olefins using the metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer strategy is described. The transformation is stereospecific and takes place through a concerted addition of the olefin to the metal&#8208;nitrene intermediates.








Abstract
After decades of development of the metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions to olefins, examples involving the use of fluorinated olefins is yet unknown, despite the current importance of fluorocompounds. Herein we describe the use of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;based catalysts for a general protocol that converts &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro olefins into the corresponding aziridines in high yields.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new quaternary ammonium TFSI ionic liquids, [MNPA][TFSI] and [NPPA][TFSI] were designed and synthesized. These ionic liquids readily dissolve quaternary ammonium fluorides (&gt;0.7&#160;M), and the resulting electrolytes have a wide operational voltage range (&gt;5.4&#160;V). Battery performance using Np2F/[MNPA][TFSI] demonstrated stable and reversible (de)fluorination reaction, with stable fluoride ion shuttling for 100&#160;h. 








Abstract
Two novel liquid electrolytes for room&#8208;temperature fluoride ion batteries are presented. These electrolytes are based on ionic liquids with quaternary ammonium cations 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N,N,N,2,2&#8208;pentamethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (MNPA) and N,N,N,2,2&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)propane&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (NPPA) combined with a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)&#8208;imide (TFSI) counterion. Quaternary ammonium fluorides can be added at concentrations up to 0.7&#160;M to a functional fluoride electrolyte with a total diffusivity of 4.99&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;12&#160;m2&#160;s&#8722;1, a viscosity of 260&#160;mP&#8901;s and a wide operational voltage range exceeding 5.4&#160;V. The liquid ion electrolyte with the MNPA cation supports stable fluoride ion shuttling for up to 100 h.

     alt="Tailored 3-Alkoxy-N,N,N,2,2-Pentamethylpropan-1-Ammonium Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)Imide Ionic Liquids for Room-Temperature Fluoride-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new quaternary ammonium TFSI ionic liquids, [MNPA][TFSI] and [NPPA][TFSI] were designed and synthesized. These ionic liquids readily dissolve quaternary ammonium fluorides (&amp;gt;0.7&#160;M), and the resulting electrolytes have a wide operational voltage range (&amp;gt;5.4&#160;V). Battery performance using Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F/[MNPA][TFSI] demonstrated stable and reversible (de)fluorination reaction, with stable fluoride ion shuttling for 100&#160;h. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two novel liquid electrolytes for room-temperature fluoride ion batteries are presented. These electrolytes are based on ionic liquids with quaternary ammonium cations 3-methoxy-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,2,2-pentamethylpropan-1-aminium (MNPA) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,2,2-pentamethyl-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)propane-1-aminium (NPPA) combined with a &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (TFSI) counterion. Quaternary ammonium fluorides can be added at concentrations up to 0.7&#160;M to a functional fluoride electrolyte with a total diffusivity of 4.99&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a viscosity of 260&#160;mP&#8901;s and a wide operational voltage range exceeding 5.4&#160;V. The liquid ion electrolyte with the MNPA cation supports stable fluoride ion shuttling for up to 100 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity In Vitro Packaging of Diverse Synthetic Cargo into Encapsulin Protein Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pack n&#8217; Play. A novel in vitro assembly system for encapsulin protein cages has been developed. Using a bulky fusion partner to prevent shell assembly in cellulo, high&#8208;fidelity assembly is triggered in vitro by proteolytic cleavage yielding robust particles with superior thermostability. This modular system packages a diverse range of cargo from proteins to dyes to drug molecules, expanding the biotechnological applications of encapsulin cages.








Abstract
Cargo&#8208;filled protein cages are powerful tools in biotechnology with demonstrated potential as catalytic nanoreactors and vehicles for targeted drug delivery. While endogenous biomolecules can be packaged into protein cages during their expression and self&#8208;assembly inside cells, synthetic cargo molecules are typically incompatible with live cells and must be packaged in vitro. Here, we report a fusion&#8208;based in vitro assembly method for packaging diverse synthetic cargo into encapsulin protein cages that outperforms standard in cellulo assembly, producing cages with superior uniformity and thermal stability. Fluorescent dyes, proteins and cytotoxic drug molecules can all be selectively packaged with high efficiency via a peptide&#8208;mediated targeting process. The exceptional fidelity and broad compatibility of our in vitro assembly platform enables generalisable access to cargo&#8208;filled protein cages that host novel synthetic functionality for diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization in Both Polar and Non&#8208;Polar Solvents via Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Amphiphilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular designs to achieve supramolecular polymerization in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents are typically orthogonal. Here, we present a new molecular design to achieve cooperative supramolecular polymerization in both non&#8208;polar and polar solvents using phenazine bisamide in which the nitrogen atoms can interact with polar solvents. This study opens up azaacenes as a new class of molecules for supramolecular polymerization in various solvents.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers in water and non&#8208;polar solvents are extensively studied as model systems to mimic biological processes and as functional materials, respectively. The molecular designs to obtain supramolecular polymers in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents are typically orthogonal. Here, we disclose a molecular design in which we combine hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide units attached to alkyl chains for compatibility with non&#8208;polar solvents and heteroatom in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core for interaction with polar solvents, leading to supramolecular polymerization of the same monomeric unit in both non&#8208;polar and mixture of polar solvents. Redox&#8208;active phenazine appended with two amide groups was studied as a model monomeric unit and it undergoes cooperative polymerization via intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding resulting in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures with co&#8208;facial type packing in non&#8208;polar solvents. Whereas, in a mixture of polar solvents, a J&#8208;type packing was observed with tunable morphology from globular to 1D nanostructures based on the polarity of the cosolvent used. Further, solvent isotopic substitution studies suggest that the amphiphilicity of the system can be attributed to the nitrogen&#8208;atom in phenazine, which is capable of interacting with polar solvent molecules. Thus, this study opens up azaacenes as a new class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units for functional supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Interfacial Chemistry and Ion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Enable Reversible Magnesium Metal Anode in Chloride&#8208;Free Mg(TFSI)2 Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) electrolyte, the 1&#8208;propylimidazole (PrIm) can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel TFSI&#8722; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface, supporting reversible Mg plating/stripping.








Abstract
Passivation of magnesium (Mg) anode in the chloride&#8208;free magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) electrolyte is a key challenge for Mg metal batteries. Tailoring solvation structure and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been considered an effective strategy. Herein, a series of imidazole co&#8208;solvents with different branched&#8208;chain structures (methyl, ethyl, and propyl) are introduced into the Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;ether electrolyte to address the passivation issue. The ion&#8208;solvent interaction, interfacial adsorption effect, and SEI formation are comprehensively studied by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations. Through molecular structure analysis, the long&#8208;chain 1&#8208;propylimidazole (PrIm) exhibits a strong coordination ability to Mg2+ and a favorable parallel adsorption configuration on the Mg surface. As a result, PrIm co&#8208;solvent can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel a part of TFSI&#8722; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface. Benefiting from the synergistic regulation effect of interfacial chemistry and ion&#8208;solvent interactions, the chloride&#8208;free Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;DME&#160;+&#160;PrIm electrolyte ensures minimal interface passivation and achieves highly reversible Mg plating/stripping. This work provides a guiding strategy for solvation structure regulation and interface engineering for rechargeable Mg metal batteries.

         <title>Aminomethyl Phosphonic Acid as Highly Effective Multifunctional Additive for Modification of Electron Transport Layer and Perovskite in Photovoltaic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple small organic molecule, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), was proposed as multifunctional additive to modify the SnO2 electron transport layer and perovskite layer as well as the SnO2/perovskite interface. The crystallinity, and electrical and optical properties of both SnO2 and perovskite layers were improved significantly. Consequently, the PCE of the AMPA&#8208;modified PSCs was enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22% with superb stability.








Abstract
The passivation of detrimental perovskite&#8208;based defects is critically acknowledged for fabricating highly effective perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The presence of a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL) is also considered a pivotal factor for effective charge extraction and transport dynamics. Herein, a simple small organic molecule, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the SnO2 ETL. The defects in the SnO2 ETL are effectively suppressed by passivating the oxygen vacancies upon the SnO2 surface. Simultaneously, the carrier mobility and crystallinity of SnO2 are enhanced, and the upward&#8208;regulated conduction band minimum (CBM) is beneficial for constructing a favorable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. Notably, the introduced residuals on the SnO2 surface can function as crystalline seeds for growth of large perovskite grains, which can passivate the defects in the perovskite bulk phase, boundaries, as well as the SnO2/perovskite interface. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the AMPA&#8208;modified PSCs is enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22%. Most importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs with AMPA maintained 94.9% of the initial PCE during 720&#160;h of storage at a relative humidity of 10%, attributed to the improved hydrophobicity of both the SnO2 and perovskite layers after AMPA modification.

Notably, the introduced residuals on the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface can function as crystalline seeds for growth of large perovskite grains, which can passivate the defects in the perovskite bulk phase, boundaries, as well as the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (&lt;i&gt;PCE&lt;/i&gt;) value of the AMPA-modified PSCs is enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22%. Most importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs with AMPA maintained 94.9% of the initial &lt;i&gt;PCE&lt;/i&gt; during 720&#160;h of storage at a relative humidity of 10%, attributed to the improved hydrophobicity of both the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and perovskite layers after AMPA modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Development for Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries: A Blueprint from Lithium or a Step Toward Originality?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique solvation environment of sodium cations, brought by their larger ion volume and lower charge density, significantly impacts the physicochemical and interfacial properties of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, highlighting the crucial importance of moving beyond mere mimicry of lithium&#8208;based designs.








Abstract
Currently, electrolyte design for sodium&#8208;based batteries is largely inherited from their lithium&#8208;based counterparts, which often present critical challenges that hinder forging new perspectives and thus further improvements. This work delves into the key properties of representative sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208;based electrolytes, encompassing prevailing salt anions. It aims to evaluate the impact of cation chemistry, including their nature and the degree of interactions with counter anions, thereby bridging the gap in effectively transferring the know&#8208;how accumulated in lithium batteries to sodium&#8208;based batteries. The results demonstrate that the unique impact of salt anions on the properties of metal&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is tightly correlated with the nature of metal cations. By synchronizing the anionic structures with the critical features of sodium cations, the solvating dynamics and transport properties, chemical stability, aluminum corrosion behavior, and other key properties of the electrolytes could be finely tuned to fit the specific requirements of advanced sodium&#8208;based batteries. This work gives an in&#8208;depth insight into the chemical and physical features of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, with a potential avenue to accelerate the deployment of high&#8208;performance sodium batteries and simultaneously inspire and guide the design of other electrolytes for emerging mono&#8208; and multivalent cation&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Enhancing the Stability of Aqueous Membrane&#8208;Free Flow Batteries: Insights into Interphase Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a new aqueous membrane&#8208;free flow battery based on a novel aqueous biphasic system with enhanced electrolyte properties. The system uses compatible species exhibiting high partitioning behavior, as demonstrated by computational and experimental analysis. These species prevent parasitic reactions, enabling unprecedented studies of the liquid&#8211;liquid interphase and providing valuable insights into advancing this battery technology.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;free flow batteries using immiscible electrolytes aim to overcome limitations of conventional redox flow batteries by eliminating expensive ion&#8208;selective membranes. However, they face challenges including low power density due to the transport constraints in immiscible electrolytes, the need for high partitioned stable compatible active species, and the overlooked self&#8208;discharge interphase phenomena that reduce coulombic efficiency. We present a novel aqueous biphasic system based on two salts improving electrolyte ionic conductivity and viscosity. Potassium ferrocyanide (K4[Fe(CN)6]) and a sulfonated viologen ((SPr2)V) species were examined computationally and experimentally, demonstrating effective redox pair separation in all oxidation states, achieving a tenfold higher concentration in their electrolyte. The mutual compatibility and stability of these species enabled unprecedented scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) analysis of the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase, revealing insights like species concentration gradients and crossover. The enhanced electrolyte properties expanded the open&#8208;circuit voltage to 1.1&#160;V and improved mass transport, enabling power densities that are 3.5 times higher than previous examples. The battery achieved 80.2% energy efficiency at a C/2 rate, and under flowing conditions, it maintained stable performance over a month (400 cycles) at high states of charge. This work presents an innovative aqueous membrane&#8208;free flow battery that avoids parasitic reactions, enabling detailed interphase studies and advancing this technology.

         <title>Regioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes for the Synthesis of the ArCF2&#8722;${\rm{ArCF}}_{{2}^{-}}$ Moiety</title>

         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes has been realized under mild conditions, and this method is capable of efficiently synthesizing compounds containing the ArCF2&#8722;${\rm{ArCF}}_{{2}^{-}}$ structural motifs and possesses good functional group tolerance. This methodology offers novel insights into the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutical compounds and biologically active molecules, as well as the synthesis of difluoro&#8208;containing bioisosteres.








Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine and fluorinated functional groups into organic molecules alters their physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating the advancement of novel therapeutics, agricultural chemicals, biological probes, and materials. Nevertheless, there remains a deficiency of methodologies for the catalytic synthesis of certain significant fluorine&#8208;containing groups, such as ArCF2&#8722;${\rm{ArCF}}_{{2}^{-}}$, under mild conditions utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals. Herein, we report a method for the regioselective hydroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under mild conditions with the aid of Ni&#9472;H intermediate catalysis, which is capable of efficiently synthesizing compounds containing the ArCF2&#8722;${\rm{ArCF}}_{{2}^{-}}$ structural motifs and possesses good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Synergistic Solvent and Composition Engineering of Perovskites for Tandems on Industrial Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic solvent and composition engineering (SSCE) strategy has been proposed to regulate the solvated phases and manipulate the transition pathways simultaneously, resulting in suppressed nonradiative recombination and improved phase stability in the mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite film with submicron thickness. This strategy enables the tandems on industrial silicon solar cells to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 31.0%, accompanied by impressive stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites based on mixed formamidinium&#8722;cesium cation and iodide&#8722;bromide halide are promising materials in the top cells that are well&#8208;matched with crystalline silicon bottom cells to construct efficient tandem photovoltaics. Nevertheless, mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite films with submicron film thickness suffer from poor crystallinity with inhomogeneous and undesirable phases, owing to the presence of multiple pathways of crystal nucleation and phase transition. Herein, we propose a synergistic solvent and composition engineering (SSCE) strategy to regulate the solvated phases and manipulate the transition pathways simultaneously. The resultant mixed cation&#8722;halide perovskite film shows optimizing crystallization and desired phase structure with suppressed nonradiative recombination and improved phase stability under aging stresses. Consequently, the SSCE strategy enables the tandem cells based on industrially ultrathin silicon wafers (120&#160;&#181;m) to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 31.0%. Those encapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial performance after 1200&#160;h continuous operation.

         <title>Develop Complex Photocatalytic System of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type Conjugated Porous Polymers and Benzyl Alcohol Mediated Autocatalysis for Practical Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>

A high&#8208;performance CPP photocatalyst containing anthraquinone and BODIPY motifs in a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A configuration was prepared, allowing efficient charge separation and transportation, and aided by benzyl alcohol to form a complex photocatalytic system. Such a complex photocatalytic system endows coexisting intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking for boosting the accumulation of &#8226;OOH, thereby enhancing the production of H2O2, reaching an unprecedentedly high production rate of 140.4&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (35.1&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1) with the AQY up to 49%.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 is conceived to be an ideal approach for replacing the industrial anthraquinone method that suffers from hefty energy penalties and environmental toxicity. However, the low concentration of H2O2 resides as the biggest hurdle for industrial production. Herein, with a focus on fabricating high&#8208;performance heterogeneous photocatalysts and establishing a highly efficient complex photocatalytic system, we report the preparation of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type conjugated porous polymers containing a photosensitizer and redox&#8208;active anthraquinone moiety for endowing highly efficient H2O2 production up to 3.0&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. Further, by exploiting the autocatalytic photooxidation feature of benzyl alcohol, &#8226;OOH as the key species contributing to H2O2 formation received a substantial accumulation, which stems from the collaboration of the photocatalytic and autocatalytic cycle. Mechanistically, the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the photocatalyst and benzyl alcohol are formed to lower the free energy of the transition states, thus leading to unprecedentedly high efficiency in the photosynthesis of H2O2 up to 140.4&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, with the concentration of 35.1&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 49%. This work provides critical insights in advancing sustainable energy conversion research.

         <title>Activating Interfacial Ion Exchange in Composite Electrolytes to Realize High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li+ percolation behavior in composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte is distinctly revealed through solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR). A composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with activated interfacial Li+ exchange and inorganic&#8208;rich interphases with electrodes is developed, which realizes ultra&#8208;long lifespan of solid&#8208;state batteries at high rates and wide temperature range.








Abstract
Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, the poor cross&#8208;phase Li+ transport restricts the rate performance and cycle life of the batteries. Herein, we revealed the Li+ percolation behavior in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based CSEs with Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 filler. The de&#8208;coordination barrier from Li+ clusters determines interfacial Li+ transport capability. We then employed a designed N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetamide (NMTFA) ligand to lower the de&#8208;coordination energy and activate interfacial Li+ exchange. The ionic conductivity is therefore increased from 3.32&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 to 7.30&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1. By tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution process, it was identified that the proportion of interfacial Li+ transport increases from 11% to 26%. The NMTFA also contributes to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich interphases with electrodes. As a result, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 solid&#8208;state batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long lifespans of 2400, 3000, and 10&#160;000 times at 2, 5, and 10C, respectively, as well as achieve 1000 cycles at 50&#160;&#176;C and 300 cycles at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This work highlights the critical role of interfacial Li+ transport for the CSEs with &#8220;polymer&#8208;Li+ clusters&#8208;filler&#8221; configuration to realize high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen Binding Energy Is Insufficient for Describing Hydrogen Evolution on Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research introduces a refined volcano model that incorporates both &#916;GH* and &#916;GHO*, addressing the limitations of traditional H models by factoring in HO* adsorption effects. Furthermore; the subquestion was discussed: Whether the metal site in SACs is the only active site? We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically the possibility of substituting neighboring N atoms for metal atoms as active sites in Cu/Ni&#8208;Pc catalysts. 








Abstract
The design principles for metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been extensively studied. Yet, consensus remains elusive, hindering advancements in hydrogen energy technologies. Although the hydrogen binding energy (&#916;GH*) has long been used as a key HER descriptor during the past two decades, originating from the activity volcano of metallic surfaces, its applicability to HER SACs has been met with significant controversy. Herein, we investigate the effects of HO*/O* poisoning and H* coverage on SACs with varied metal centers and coordination environments using pH&#8208;dependent surface Pourbaix diagrams at the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale and microkinetic modeling. Our findings reveal that HO* poisoning, realistic H* adsorption strengths at active metal sites, and the potential HER activity at the coordinating N&#8208;sites are crucial factors that should be considered for accurate descriptor development. Experimental validation using a series of M&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu) confirms the theoretical predictions, with excellent agreement in exchange current densities and the role of N&#8208;sites in Ni/Cu&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts. This work provides answers to a long&#8208;lasting debate on HER descriptors by establishing &#916;GH* and &#916;GHO* as a combined HER descriptor for SACs, offering new guidelines for catalyst design.

Topologically unique, 3D cage&#8208;like noradamantanes are synthesized in one pot from simple starting materials. Catalyzed by diphenylprolinol silyl ether, the reaction followed a domino sequence of Michael/epimerization/Michael/1,2&#8208;addition, achieving excellent enantioselectivity. This method formed three C&#9472;C bonds and six chiral centers, including a quaternary all&#8208;carbon center, with five fully stereocontrolled.








Abstract
Topologically unique chiral noradamantanes are synthesized using a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8208;mediated domino Michael/epimerization/Michael/1,2&#8208;addition or Michael/epimerization/aldol/1,2&#8208;addition reaction with excellent enantioselectivity in a single reaction vessel. Three carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are formed, and six chiral centers, including one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, are generated, five of which are fully controlled. These functionalized noradamantanes are 3D, cage&#8208;like molecules that can serve as valuable chiral building blocks for drug design.

         <title>Interfacial Lithium Cations Catalyze Biomimetic Aerobic Oxygenation via Short&#8208;Range Electrostatic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial Li+ cations bear biomimetic functions by not only facilitating the Li+&#8211;OOH&#8722; complex formation that mimics FAD&#8211;OO&#8722; complex (flavin adenine dinucleotide&#8211;OO&#8722;), in the Baeyer Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO), but also attracting surrounding H2O molecules to prevent the quenching of the active complex, which resembles the NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) cofactor that acts on BVMOs.








Abstract
Enzymes often involve short&#8208;range electrostatic interactions in the deliberate microenvironment for accelerating the catalysis. Comparatively, electrostatic interactions from ions in solutions are mostly shielded by solvent or counter&#8208;ion shells, creating negligible catalytic effects. Herein, we discovered that the interfacial Li+ cations accumulated on electrodes catalyze the selective water&#8208;involved O2 electro&#8208;reduction into peroxide anion (OOH&#8722;), forming an active side&#8208;on Li+&#8211;OOH&#8722; complex via short&#8208;range electrostatic interaction. This complex reduces the O2 reduction energy barrier and increases the nucleophilicity, expediting the aerobic oxygenation of ketones. Aside from trapping active intermediates, Li+ cations also attract the excessive water dipoles to prevent them from quenching the active Li+&#8211;OOH&#8722; complex. By using probe&#8208;assisted quantitative methods, we demonstrated the unique under&#8208;coordinative characteristics of interfacial Li+ for interacting with reaction intermediates, and the effective concentration of under&#8208;coordinative Li+ on the interface is an order of magnitude higher than in the bulk solution. These analyses provide essential evidences about the intrinsic difference between bulk ions and interfacial ions toward catalysis.

         <title>Aqueous Self&#8208;Assembly of Cylindrical and Tapered Bottlebrush Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic tapered bottlebrush block copolymers with cone&#8208;shaped architectures using a combination of experiments and simulations. Results revealed two distinct self&#8208;assembly pathways leading to diverse nanostructures, including vesicles formed via semivesicle intermediates. The findings highlight the critical role of bottlebrush block copolymer shape in determining their self&#8208;assembly behavior.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs), featuring backbones densely grafted with two types of side chains, is less well understood compared to linear BCPs. In particular, the solution self&#8208;assembly of tapered bottlebrush BCPs&#8212;cone&#8208;shaped BCPs with hydrophilic or hydrophobic tips&#8212;remains unexplored. This study investigates eight tapered and four cylindrical bottlebrush BCPs with varied ratios of hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) and hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) side chains, synthesized via sequential addition of macromonomers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (SAM&#8208;ROMP). Self&#8208;assembled nanostructures formed in water were analyzed using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small&#8208;angle neutron scattering, and dynamic light scattering. Most BCPs generated multiple nanostructures with surface protrusions, including spherical micelles, cylindrical micelles, and vesicles, alongside transitional forms like ellipsoids and semi&#8208;vesicles. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations supported the experimental findings, which revealed two distinct self&#8208;assembly pathways. The first involved micelle fusion, producing elliptical and cylindrical aggregates, sometimes forming Y&#8208;junctions. The second pathway featured micelle maturation into semivesicles, which developed into vesicles or large compound vesicles. This work provides the first experimental evidence of vesicle formation via semivesicles in bottlebrush BCPs and demonstrates the significant influence of cone directionality on self&#8208;assembly behavior in these cone&#8208;shaped polymeric amphiphiles.

         <title>Competitive&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Induced Crystallization Regulation for Efficient and Stable Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5&#8208;AH) is introduced into perovskite precursor solution to selectivity coordinates with SnI2 forming the thermodynamically favored SnI2&#8208;5&#8208;AH adducts with stronger SnI2&#8208;Cl&#8722;, effectively delaying the reaction rate of SnI2 and FAI and thus mediating the crystallization rate, resulting in an improved spatial homogeneity of Sn and Pb components. As a result, the 5&#8208;AH&#8208;treated Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells achieve a high efficiency of up to 23.76% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The unbalanced crystallization rate between Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskites leads to their heterogeneous distribution and inferior quality of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films. The promising strategy of selective molecular interaction would balance the crystallization rate. However, the deeper selectivity mechanism needs to be considered, particularly in terms of the entire coordination reaction in the perovskite precursor solution. Herein, we take advantage of thermodynamics and molecular orbital theory to reveal the competitive coordination of additive, i.e., methyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5&#8208;AH), with SnI2 and PbI2. The SnI2 competes with PbI2 in coordinating with 5&#8208;AH to form the thermodynamically favored SnI2&#8208;5&#8208;AH adducts with stronger SnI2&#8208;Cl&#8722;, thereby mediating the crystallization rate of the Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskite. Such crystallization regulation improves the composition uniformity and crystallization quality, which effectively suppresses nonradiative recombination. Additionally, the strong interaction between Sn2+ and 5&#8208;AH as well as reductive grain boundaries inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+. Therefore, the optimal devices with 5&#8208;AH exhibit an improved PCE of 23.76% with a high voltage of 0.885&#160;V and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Monitoring Glycolysis by Endogenous 31P CEST Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel 3&#185;P CEST method to monitor glycolysis by reducing the detectability threshold of signals of endogenous phosphate&#8208;containing substrates whose direct detection is challenging. In vitro, the method proved to be able to discriminate among breast cancer cells with different aggressiveness, and in vivo, to differentiate tumor and healthy tissue based on their metabolic characteristics.








Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach to investigate glycolysis by means of the 3&#185;P CEST technique applied to phosphate&#8208;containing substrates at their endogenous concentration. The method relies on the assessment of the saturation transfer (ST) observed on the 3&#185;P signals of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or phosphocreatine (PCr) following the selective irradiation of phosphate groups of endogenous molecules exchanging with ATP, Pi, and indirectly with PCr in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The concentrations of these substrates often fall below the threshold for direct detection. The 3&#185;P CEST technique amplifies their responses, making them detectable via the ST effect to the 3&#185;P resonance of the selected reference signal. The method was first validated in vitro on mouse breast adenocarcinoma cell pellets (TS/A), where the intracellular Pi signal was monitored to assess the ST effect associated with the saturation of phosphoester&#8208;containing molecules. The use of a glycolysis inhibitor and different experimental temperatures (37&#160;&#176;C or 4&#160;&#176;C) provided insights supporting the rationale behind the method. A comparison of 3&#185;P Z&#8208;spectra was carried out on murine breast cancer cell lines with different degrees of aggressiveness, showing the ability to assess metabolic differences. Finally, in vivo experiments on mice models of mammary adenocarcinoma demonstrated that 3&#185;P CEST can differentiate tumor and healthy tissue based on their metabolic characteristics.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyne Lipids Enable Efficient Synthesis of Comparable Polymer Lipids via Copper&#8208;Free Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
This work uses electron&#8208;deficient acetylenedicarboxylate lipids for the synthesis of polymer lipids via Cu&#8208;free azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. We successfully obtained a variety of polymer lipids which all enabled the preparation of well&#8208;defined, stabilized liposomes. Additionally, the linker structure &#8211; a 1,2,3&#8208;triazol diester &#8211; shows suitable pH&#8208;stability and biocompatibility for in vivo applications.








Abstract
Polymer lipids (PLs) are essential components of liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for drug and gene delivery, providing colloidal stabilization and defining the biological interface. While poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based PLs are the current standard, they are suspected to be responsible for rare adverse reactions, e. g. to LNP&#8208;based Covid&#8208;19 vaccines. Therefore, PLs based on alternative stealth polymers are being intensively investigated for their use in LNPs. However, alternative PLs often lack comparability due to different synthesis protocols and are often not easily accessible. Herein we present a catalyst&#8208;free, efficient and versatile coupling procedure for PL synthesis based on azide&#8208;functionalized polymers and electron&#8208;deficient acetylene dicarboxylate lipids. To highlight the versatility of this approach, we prepared PLs based on PEG and 4 alternative stealth polymers with quantitative coupling efficiencies. The linker structure showed appropriate pH stability and biocompatibility. All PLs enabled the preparation of well&#8208;defined liposomes with excellent stability. Our facile and versatile approach yields comparable PLs with minimized linker size, making them promising candidates for future comparative studies, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Antimicrobial Peptide&#8208;Peptoid Macrocycles from the Polymyxin B2 Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We optimized mixed peptide&#8208;peptoid sequences for molecular similarity to the macrocyclic lipopeptide antibiotic polymyxin B2 (PMB2) using a genetic algorithm. Synthesis and testing of top&#8208;scoring compounds allowed us to identify new macrocycles with similar antimicrobial activity and reduced toxicity compared to PMB2. Our approach might be generally useful to explore the chemical space of macrocyclic natural products.








Abstract
Macrocycles have emerged as important new modalities in drug discovery. In the context of addressing the global threat of antimicrobial resistance, here we used a genetic algorithm as a computational tool to evolve peptide&#8208;peptoid macrocycles to resemble polymyxin B2 (PMB2), a macrocyclic lipopeptide natural product used as last resort antibiotic. Synthesis and testing of 41 PMB2 analogs revealed several peptide&#8208;peptoid macrocycles showing strong, although salt sensitive, activity against Escherichia coli and multidrug&#8208;resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, high serum stability, and lower toxicity to kidney cells compared to PMB2. These macrocycles resembled PMB2 in terms of outer membrane permeabilization, inner membrane depolarization, lipopolysaccharide binding, and loss of activity when linearized, but, unlike PMB2, induced aggregation of intracellular contents, an effect was reported for other antimicrobial peptoids. These experiments exemplify a combined computational and experimental approach which might be generally useful to explore the chemical space of macrocyclic peptide natural products.

         <title>Microporous Hard Carbon Support Provokes Exceptional Performance of Single Atom Electrocatalysts for Advanced Air Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe single atoms in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC) possesses a microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets, which serves confined microenvironment for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC yields a remarkable ORR performance, and hydrogen bonding between the intermediates and micropore interior surfaces accelerates ORR kinetics. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC shows outstanding performance in zinc&#8208;air batteries and industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts embracing metal&#8208;nitrogen (MNx) moieties show promising performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The modification on spatially confined microenvironments, which won copious attention with respect to achieving efficient catalysts, are auspicious but yet to be inspected for MNx moieties from modulating the energetics and kinetics of ORR. Here, Fe single atoms (SAs) are immobilized in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC), in which the microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets serves confined microenvironment for catalysis. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC holds a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.927&#160;V and excellent stability for ORR. Theoretical studies unveil that hydrogen bonding between the intermediate of O* and micropore interior surfaces substantially promote its protonation and accelerate the overall ORR kinetics. Both the aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries driven by Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC air cathode show excellent stability with small charging/discharging voltage gaps. Importantly, when used as the air cathode for industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process, the applied voltage of Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC&#8208;based flow cell to reach 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is 1.57&#160;V, which is 210&#160;mV smaller than Pt/C&#8208;based one. These findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into the confined microenvironment of MNx moieties for boosted electrochemical performance, and pave the pathways for future catalyst development satisfying the requirement of industrial applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Phosphorus&#8208;Based Fluorescent Sensors: Synthesis and Selective Metal Sensing of Pyrazolyl Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazolyl phosphine oxides are shown to act as dual&#8208;responsive fluorescent sensors, displaying a selective &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; fluorescence response for Fe3+ and a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response for Al3+. These systems serve as a new framework in the field of sensing materials based on main&#8208;group elements such as phosphorus.








Abstract
Despite a wealth of previously reported frameworks for fluorescent metal sensors, there are few examples of phosphorus&#8208;based fluorophores being used in metal sensing applications. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new family of pyrazolyl phosphine oxides and their use in metal sensing applications. The mechanism of their formation has been probed in detail with both computational and experimental studies, rationalizing the selectivity of the reaction. Their use as dual&#8208;responsive fluorescent metal sensors is then demonstrated, with &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; and &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses observed for Fe3+ and Al3+, respectively. These systems exhibit good selectivity, large Stokes shifts, and submicromolar limits of detection and will open new avenues in phosphorus&#8208;based fluorophores and metal&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Regiospecific 2,3&#8208;Dialkylindole Synthesis Enabled by Alkylpalladium 1,2&#8208;Migration to In Situ Formed Aldimine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiospecific synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dialkylindoles via a 1,2&#8208;alkylpalladium migration to an in situ&#8208;generated aldimine intermediate. The unprecedented 1,2&#8208;alkylpalladium migration process is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments, providing robust evidence for its mechanistic feasibility. 








Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dialkylindoles play crucial roles in natural products and pharmaceuticals, but the step&#8208;efficient and regioselective construction of such privileged structures remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a regiospecific non&#8208;Fischer indole synthesis through chemoselective 1,2&#8208;migratory addition of alkylpalladium to an aldimine intermediate, formed in situ through a palladium hydride&#8208;triggered sequential isocyanide and intramolecular olefin insertion. This unprecedented 1,2&#8208;migratory addition leads to formal C&#9552;C bond cleavage and isocyano carbon insertion between the two sp2 carbons, offering a novel approach to specific 2,3&#8208;dialkyl substituted N&#9472;H free indoles from readily available alkyl substituted 1&#8208;isocyano&#8208;2&#8208;vinylbenzenes.

&lt;p&gt;A regiospecific synthesis of 2,3-dialkylindoles via a 1,2-alkylpalladium migration to an in situ-generated aldimine intermediate. The unprecedented 1,2-alkylpalladium migration process is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments, providing robust evidence for its mechanistic feasibility.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Z&#8208;Selective Styrene Synthesis via Dual Cobalt and Photocatalysis Through Coupling of Unactivated Alkyl Iodides With Terminal Arylalkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;XAT/Co dual catalysis enables a highly Z&#8208;selective olefin synthesis through the reductive coupling of unactivated alkyl iodides with terminal arylalkynes. Syn&#8208;homoallylic alcohols can be synthesized in a facile one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step sequence. DFT calculations indicate that the reaction proceeds via a Co(II)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.








Abstract
An efficient Z&#8208;selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroalkylation of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides has been achieved, providing a straightforward and modular route to access 1,2&#8208;disubstituted Z&#8208;styrenes. This reaction operates under mild conditions without requiring over&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metal terminal reductants. Excellent Z/E ratios and good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. One potential utility of this reaction is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of several syn homoallylic alcohols in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step sequence. Control experiments strongly support that the halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) process is the key to generating carbon radicals. DFT studies suggest that the catalytic system involves the Co(II)/Co(III) cycle and the steric repulsion between the Co(II) catalyst, and the alkenyl radical in radical capture by Co(II) is the dominant factor controlling the Z/E selectivity. This approach represents the first example of merging photo&#8208;XAT with cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides.

The LZCCO0.8 SEs exhibit several advantageous properties, including cost&#8208;effectiveness, enhanced ionic conductive, remarkable oxidation stability, and good mechanical deformability. When paired with a LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode, the ASSLBs demonstrate a notably stable cycling performance, retaining 90.3% capacity after 1000 cycles within a voltage range of 2.8&#8211;4.3&#160;V at 2 C. This study provides new insights into the design of solid electrolytes with a high ionic conductivity, paving a new way for next&#8208;generation ASSLBs. 








Abstract
Within the family of halide solid electrolytes (SEs), Li2ZrCl6 demonstrates high oxidative stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and mechanical deformability, positioning it as a promising candidate for SEs. However, the application of Li2ZrCl6 as a SEs was hindered by its low ionic conductivity at room temperature. Current strategies to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6 primarily are focused on single cation or anion sublattice&#8208;engineering, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Here, we propose a novel cation and anion&#8208;sublattice&#8208;engineering strategy, termed CASE, to increase the amorphous content and thus enhance ionic conductivity. The incorporation of Cu2+ and O2&#8722; induces distinctive structural modifications within Li2ZrCl6. This structure corroborated through analytic data of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the neutron diffraction, and ab initio molecular dynamics. Consequently, the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 achieves an enhanced ionic conductivity of 2.05&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries utilizing the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 as an electrolyte and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 as a cathode exhibit a superior long&#8208;term cycling stability retaining 90.3% of capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C under room temperature, which are much higher than those of Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes in publications. Such a result might stimulate the development of more amorphous structures with high ionic conductivity in the CASE strategy.

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of a Ground&#8208;State Electron Donor Through Water Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents catalytically generated phosphine oxide radical anions, derived from commercial phosphines and water as potent single&#8208;electron reductants capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides at&#160;potentials as low as &#8722;3.3&#160;V (vs. SCE). Cyclic voltammetry studies and DFT calculations offer insights into these P&#8208;based ground&#8208;state electron donors, broadening the scope of phosphoranyl radical chemistry. This work highlights the potential of in situ generated reductants, achieving redox potentials comparable to elemental potassium.








Abstract
Electron donors that can be excited to higher energy states through light absorption can achieve oxidation potentials as low as &#8722;3.0&#160;V (vs. SCE). However, ground&#8208;state organic electron transfer reagents operating at such potentials remain underdeveloped, often necessitating multi&#8208;step syntheses and elevated reaction temperatures for activation. The longer lifetime of ground&#8208;state reagents is an advantage compared to most photoexcited single&#8208;electron reductants, which typically have relatively short lifetimes. In this study, catalytically generated phosphine oxide radical anions derived from phosphines and water applying redox catalysis are introduced as highly efficient single&#8208;electron reductants. The in situ generated radical anions are capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides at potentials as low as &#8722;3.3&#160;V (vs. SCE). Cyclic voltammetry studies and DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the behavior of these phosphorus&#8208;based ground&#8208;state electron donors. These findings do not only expand the chemistry of phosphoranyl radicals but also unlock the potential of in situ generated organic ground state electron donors that reach potentials comparable to elemental potassium.

         <title>Transition from Tunneling to Schottky Barriers in Molecular Junctions Based on Polyoxometalate Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates molecular&#8208;scale Schottky diodes based on polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, forming self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au with EGaIn top&#8208;electrodes. POMs' high electron affinity and redox versatility enable Schottky&#8208;like barriers at the POM/EGaIn interface, achieving a rectification ratio&#160;&gt;&#160;3000. Temperature&#8208;dependent studies reveal a transition from direct tunneling to thermionic emission at&#160;&gt;1.0&#160;V bias.








Abstract
Schottky barriers are typically observed in mesoscale materials but are challenging to form at the molecular scale due to the discrete energy levels of molecules and the limited length of the transport channel, which hinder the development of an effective depletion region. In this study, we present the development of a molecular&#8208;scale Schottky diode within a monolayer junction by utilizing self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters. The high electron affinity and multiple redox states of POMs facilitate band bending at the molecule/EGaIn (Ga and In alloy) electrode interface, promoting the formation of a Schottky&#8208;like band structure. This molecular monolayer junction demonstrates an exceptional rectification ratio exceeding 3000, and temperature&#8208;dependent measurements reveal a transition in the charge transport mechanism from direct tunneling at low bias to thermionic emission at high bias.

     alt="Transition from Tunneling to Schottky Barriers in Molecular Junctions Based on Polyoxometalate Monolayers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates molecular-scale Schottky diodes based on polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, forming self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au with EGaIn top-electrodes. POMs' high electron affinity and redox versatility enable Schottky-like barriers at the POM/EGaIn interface, achieving a rectification ratio&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;3000. Temperature-dependent studies reveal a transition from direct tunneling to thermionic emission at&#160;&amp;gt;1.0&#160;V bias.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schottky barriers are typically observed in mesoscale materials but are challenging to form at the molecular scale due to the discrete energy levels of molecules and the limited length of the transport channel, which hinder the development of an effective depletion region. In this study, we present the development of a molecular-scale Schottky diode within a monolayer junction by utilizing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters. The high electron affinity and multiple redox states of POMs facilitate band bending at the molecule/EGaIn (Ga and In alloy) electrode interface, promoting the formation of a Schottky-like band structure. This molecular monolayer junction demonstrates an exceptional rectification ratio exceeding 3000, and temperature-dependent measurements reveal a transition in the charge transport mechanism from direct tunneling at low bias to thermionic emission at high bias. POM-based molecular junctions offer promising potential for molecular-scale Schottky devices, introducing novel mechanisms for high-performance molecular diodes. With their low power consumption, molecular diversity, and potential for integration into nanoscale circuits, molecular Schottky diodes are well-positioned to become key components in functional molecular devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bounded Intracellular E3 Ubiquitin Ligase&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (MembTACs) for Targeted Membrane Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;bounded intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase&#8208;targeting chimeras (MembTACs) were developed to simultaneously recruit intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase and bind to the desired membrane proteins for targeted degradation of membrane proteins. MembTACs were demonstrated to effectively degrade membrane protein EpCAM and Met via the proteasome pathway, providing a new platform for membrane protein degradation and expanding PROTAC applications.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) represents a potent therapeutic strategy aimed at dismantling disease&#8208;associated target proteins. PROTAC is the most widely developed technique for intracellular protein degradation, while its degradation ability on membrane proteins has been hindered by the need for complex synthetic processes and limited permeability. In this study, we developed the membrane&#8208;bounded intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase&#8208;targeting chimeras (MembTACs) that simultaneously recruit intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase and bind to the desired membrane proteins for targeted degradation of membrane proteins. We demonstrate that the MembTACs can effectively utilize intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of EpCAM and Met via the proteasome pathway. We anticipate that the new platform will expand the range of PROTAC applications and provide a new dimension for targeted membrane protein degradation.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Substituted Porous C2N Frameworks as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;substituted porous C2N framework (O&#9472;C2N) catalyst with fine&#8208;tailored N&#9472;C&#9472;O configurations is fabricated through a thermal condensation method, which is directly applied for efficient CO2 electroreduction with a CO selectivity up to 94.8%. Based on the combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, a correlation between the well&#8208;defined C&#9472;O&#9472;C active moieties and CO selectivity is established.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a green avenue for decarbonizing the conventional chemical industries. Here, a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship of catalysts is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active CO2RR pathway. We report the fabrication of an oxygen&#8208;substituted C2N as metal&#8208;free catalyst (O&#9472;C2N) for electrochemical CO2&#9472;to&#9472;CO conversion with tunable O microenvironment. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored N&#9472;C&#9472;O moiety in O&#9472;C2N, where C&#9472;O&#9472;C species (e.g., ring in&#8208;plane ether) become the dominant oxygen configurations at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on experimental observations, a correlation between the exocyclic O&#8208;substituted N&#9472;C&#9472;O&#9472;C moieties and CO selectivity is established, giving clear chemical tools for active structure design. The optimized O&#9472;C2N electrocatalysts with the dominant appearance of C&#9472;O&#9472;C moieties exhibit an outstanding 2e&#8722; CO2RR performance with a CO selectivity up to 94.8%, which can be well maintained in a practical flow&#8208;cell reactor with an adjustable syngas feature.

         <title>Carbon and Oxygen Double Defects&#8208;Enhanced Ru&#8208;Based Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partial coating of CeO2 enhances the stability of the catalyst and creates abundant CeO2&#8208;CNTs interfacial structures. Significant C&#9472;O interactions at these interfaces facilitate the formation of C and O double defect sites. These defects synergistically regulate electron transfer, NH3 adsorption, and product desorption, ultimately achieving remarkable enhancement in catalytic performance for ammonia decomposition.








Abstract
Although ammonia is widely recognized as one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen storage and transformation, the catalytic mechanisms involved in ammonia decomposition remain insufficiently understood, and the stability of catalysts continues to present significant challenges. In this study, Ru/CeO2&#8208;CNTs catalysts with double defect sites were synthesized by a straightforward method, achieving an outstanding hydrogen production rate of 2230&#160;mmol&#8722;1&#160;gRu&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1 at 500 &#176;C, outperforming most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the CeO2&#8208;CNTs interface promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) and carbon defects (Cd) through carbon&#8211;oxygen interactions. These defects enhance electron transfer from the support to Ru nanoparticles (NPs), modulate NH3 adsorption and activation and modulate the recombination and desorption of adsorbed N species (N*). Moreover, the coating of CeO2 significantly improved the stability of CNTs, which weakens undesired reactions under high&#8208;temperature and hydrogen&#8208;rich conditions. The study introduced a rational design strategy that enhances the multiple elementary stages of the NH3 decomposition by constructing double defect sites and offering new insights into the design of efficient and durable catalysts under harsh environments.

         <title>Quantum Mechanical Tunnelling Probes with Redox Cycling for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Detection of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop&#160;a redox cycling&#8208;coupled&#160;electrochemical tunnelling biosensors&#160;with&#160;quantum mechanical tunnelling probes&#160;containing&#160;sub&#8208;2 nm gap distances and demonstrate their application for direct protein detection in biofluids.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunnelling sensors (QMTs) have emerged as a promising technology for next&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule detection. Furthermore, QMT sensors can be combined with redox species resulting in repeated oxidation and reduction (redox cycling).. We developed robust QMT probes with electrode gap distances below 2&#8197;nm. Using the generator&#8208;collector (GC) mode, we verified that redox cycling of the ferrocyanide/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722;) couple occurs both in the tunnelling regime and on the electrode surface. Our findings indicated that the current enhancement is affected by both the gap distance and surface modifications of the probes. These QMT probes exhibited remarkable sensitivity, capable of detecting Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722; concentrations down to sub&#8208;picomolar levels. Utilising this ability to modulate redox reactions, we adapted the QMT probes to serve as electrochemical sensors for detecting viral proteins. By modifying the electrode surfaces, our functionalised QMT probes achieved sub&#8208;pM detection limits with high selectivity in biofluids such as nasopharyngeal secretions. These findings highlight the potential of QMT probes to develop into a new class of electrochemical tunnelling sensors, offering significant advancements in biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>C&#9472;S Bonds Modulated Nanointerface Tension to Create Stable Magnetic Hollow Nanocarbons for Efficient Microplastics Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new perspective in creating structural stable, well&#8208;defined hollow nanostructures by modulating nanointerface tension via C&#9472;S bonds. Practiced from this stability design principle, a functional integrated magnetic hollow nanocarbons featuring an increased contact area, magnetically facilitated mass transfer, and a sulfur&#8208;modified surface, achieves high&#8208;capacity, rapid, and widely adaptable microplastics capture.








Abstract
Microplastic pollution poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Hollow nanomaterials are promising adsorbents for microplastics remediation due to their tailorable architectures, functions, and large contact area. Nevertheless, the structural stability of well&#8208;defined nanostructures has always been a critical factor, and understanding the stability principle is desired. Herein, we fabricated magnetic hollow nanocarbons as &#8220;nano&#8208;analytical tool&#8221;, revealing that the stability is related to additional pressure caused by nanointerface tension at curved carbon shell surface. To mitigate this, we introduced C&#9472;S bonds by sulfurizing carbon matrix, suppressing the condensation of oxygen&#8208;containing groups and thereby reducing interface tension. As a showcase, the stable hollow Fe3O4@C/S enabled rapid and efficient microplastics capture (100% within 10 s, 53 600&#160;mg g&#8722;1 capacity) under an alternating magnetic field, owing to the magnetically accelerated mass transfer and increased contact area. Additionally, sulfur modification broadens applicability range where carbon surface is oppositely charged to microplastics, expanding the universality in capturing multiple types of microplastics, even under challenging conditions including different pH and salinities. This work offers guidance into the precise synthesis of hollow nanomaterials from nanointerface perspective. The design principles involving sulfur modification and high&#8208;contact area may open prospects for high&#8208;capacity microplastics capture in complex aquatic environments.

         <title>Avoiding the Kauzmann Paradox via Interface&#8208;Driven Divergence in States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface&#8208;driven stress in core&#8208;shell particle architecture caused by surface speciation creates divergence of associated stress vectors, resulting in nonequilibrium fluxes and deep supercooling. Analysis of nonequilibrium phase models reveals that the addition of an intermediary interfacial state results in evolution in the thermodynamic speed limits that can avoid the entropy catastrophe and resolve the Kauzmann paradox (KP).








Abstract
Kauzmann paradox (KP) suggests that deeply supercooled liquids can have a lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline solids. While this entropy catastrophe has been thoroughly studied via equilibrium thermodynamics, the solidification process occurs far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium. By analyzing this process experimentally and theoretically, we show that surface chemical speciation (oxidation&#8208;driven generation and self&#8208;organization of different species of the alloy components) in core&#8208;shell particles (CSPs) can perturb the entropy production to an extent that a continuum equilibrium phase transition is not possible. Speciation of the surface causes divergence of associated stress vectors that generate nonequilibrium fluxes and frustrates homogeneous nucleation hence deep undercooling. The asymmetry of the speciation&#8208;derived surface tensor skews the minimum entropy production criterion. We analyze a set of nonequilibrium models, one showing and one averting the entropy catastrophe. Applying thermodynamic speed limits to these models, we show that the KP takes another form. Deviations from the speed limit diverge the configurational entropy of the glass, but adding an interfacial state avoids the entropy catastrophe with significantly large supercooling.

         <title>Decoding Variants of Pyrite, Arsenopyrite, and Marcasite Using an Electron Counting Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new &#8216;structure determining electron&#8217; (SDE) rule allows identifying marcasite (M), arsenopyrite (A), and pyrite (P) related compounds based on the electron distribution around transition metals. It offers a framework for categorising structural variants as compounds with M, A, and P layers. Nine new ternary representatives, including the first to show both hetero&#8208; and homoatomic dumbbells, demonstrate enhanced chemical diversity. 








Abstract
Pyrite (P), marcasite (M), and arsenopyrite (A) are of significant historical and contemporary interest. Compounds adopting these structure types are studied for their crystallographic properties and potential applications in energy storage and conversion. Despite numerous investigations since the 1970s, understanding the chemical behaviour of pyrite, marcasite, and arsenopyrite remains limited. This study proposes a new structure determining electron (SDE) rule to systematise these compounds without relying on formal charge assignments. The SDE rule predicts structure types based on the distribution of non&#8208;localised electrons around transition metals, providing a framework for identifying and categorising related compounds. We observe good agreement with literature data and furthermore synthesised nine new ternary compounds within the Pt/Ir&#8208;Ge&#8211;As/Sb systems, demonstrating the applicability of&#160;SDE. Our findings reveal that these compounds can be seen as layer configurations of P, M and A, enhancing our understanding of their chemical diversity. This work not only categorises existing compounds, but also paves the way for future exploration of new materials, highlighting the structural potential of P,&#160;M,&#160;A&#8208;related compounds beyond traditional frameworks. Preliminary results indicate that the type of layers influences physical properties, such as electrical conductivity, warranting further investigation into the relationship between structure and function in these compounds.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Strategy Yields Dopant&#8208;Free Small Molecule Hole Transport Materials for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with 20.58% Efficiency and Outstanding Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>

A symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy was used to design two isomeric D&#8211;A&#8211;D small molecules with 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole or benzo[d][1,2,3]thiadiazole as acceptor motifs for dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials in CsPbI&#8323; perovskite solar cells. Structural asymmetry can effectively regulates the dipole moment, energy level alignment, coordination&#8208;active sites, and thereby enabling a record PCE of 20.58% with outstanding stability.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskites are known for their excellent photothermal stability; however, the photothermal stability of all&#8208;inorganic n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is compromised due to ion diffusion and free radical&#8208;induced degradation caused by the use of doped spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport materials (HTMs). In this study, two isomeric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type small molecules, namely HBT and HiBT, were developed and used as dopant&#8208;free HTMs, using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole or benzo[d][1,2,3]thiadiazole as acceptor moieties. The HiBT molecule, with its symmetry&#8208;breaking features, exhibits a large dipole moment, enhanced coordination&#8208;active sites, and a well&#8208;aligned energy level structure, all of which contribute to passivating perovskite surface defects and improving free charge separation. As a result, inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with HiBT HTM achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.58%, the highest reported for dopant&#8208;free HTM&#8208;based inorganic PSCs. Moreover, the enhanced hydrophobic properties of HiBT molecules, coupled with their ability to passivate perovskite surface defects, contribute to significantly improved device stability. The unencapsulated devices based on HiBT HTM retained over 83% and 80% of their initial efficiency after being stored at 85&#160;&#176;C for 50 days and undergoing maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1100 h, respectively. These results highlight that the symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy is an exceptionally effective approach for designing efficient, dopant&#8208;free small molecule HTMs, significantly contributing to both the high efficiency and enhanced stability of all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.

An intramolecular Pd&#8208;catalyzed spirocyclization enables the synthesis of chiral spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactams in up to 97% yield and 96% ee. The utility of this transformation has been demonstrated across 14 examples, including compounds bearing polyheterocyclic motifs and handles for further derivatization. Preliminary mechanistic investigations implicate the formation of catalytically relevant higher&#8208;order species.








Abstract
An enantioselective cyclization of Pd&#8208;enolates and isocyanates to form spirocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactams is reported. This reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions and utilizes a novel Meldrum's acid derivative to achieve catalyst turnover, delivering enantioenriched products in up to 97% yield and 96% ee. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction may proceed via the formation of higher&#8208;order species.

         <title>Achieving 32% Efficiency in Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Bidentate&#8208;Anchored Superwetting Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bidentate&#8208;anchored superwetting aromatic self&#8208;assembled monolayer is employed as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. The reversely substituted carbazole approach is crucial in promoting the formation of a robust HSL, improving hole extraction efficiency. The optimized wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.83%, and the fabricated P/S&#8208;TSCs achieve an impressive efficiency of 32.19% (certified 31.54%) while maintaining excellent photostability.








Abstract
The inhomogeneity of hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled molecular layers (SAMLs) often arises from the insufficient bonding between anchors and metal oxide, particularly on textured silicon surfaces when fabricating monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (P/S&#8208;TSCs) and the hydrophobic carbazole complicates the fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films. To address this, we developed a novel bidentate&#8208;anchored superwetting aromatic SAM based on an upside&#8208;down carbazole core as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL), denoted as ((9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;3,6&#8208;diyl)bis(4,1&#8208;phenylene))bis(phosphonic acid) (2PhPA&#8208;CzH). The bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored exhibited enhanced adsorption capabilities and efficient hole extraction/transport, and the reversely substituted carbazole ring contributed a friendly super wetting underlayer that enabled high&#8208;quality perovskite films with minimized energetic mismatches, which 2PhPA&#8208;CzH played a pivotal role in dual interfacial energy regulation. Through these advancements, the optimized wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#160;eV) PSCs demonstrated an improved PCE of 22.83% and excellent stability with T90 exceeding 1000&#160;h under damp&#8208;heat conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;3, 85% RH, 85&#160;&#176;C), representing one of the best performances for SAMs as HSL&#8208;based PSCs. Notably, 2PhPA&#8208;CzH&#8208;functionalized recombination layers extended to submicron&#8208;pyramid texture SHJ to fabricate P/S&#8208;TSCs, achieving an impressive efficiency of 32.19% at an active area of 1&#160;cm2 (certified 31.54%) while maintaining excellent photostability. This work offers guidance for designing multidentate&#8208;anchored SAMs to realize record PCE and excellent stability in P/S&#8208;TSCs.

         <title>Steric Coordinated Electrolytes for Fast&#8208;Charging and Low&#8208;Temperature Energy&#8208;Dense Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric coordination chemistry between Li+ and ether solvent provides sufficient ion transport over a wide&#8208;temperature range, high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, and fast charge transfer process, which enable the long&#8208;term stability, fast charging capability and low&#8208;temperature adaptation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Electrolytes are known as the dominant factors for fast&#8208;charging affordability and low&#8208;temperature capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the current electrolytes can hardly simultaneously satisfy all the required characteristics, including sufficient ion transport, high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, and fast de&#8208;solvation process over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Here, we report a solution by designing electrolyte solvents that coordinate with Li+ in steric configuration. The steric coordinated electrolytes (SCEs) can overcome the dilemma of quasi&#8208;planer coordinated ether electrolytes that has to be weakly coordinated with Li+ to avoid solvent co&#8208;intercalation towards graphite (Gr) anode, therefore enabling the merits including sufficiently dissociation of Li&#8208;salt with high ionic conductivity, low de&#8208;solvation energy, and forming electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with low energy barrier. As results, the SCEs with only single&#8208;salt and single&#8208;solvent (trimethoxymethane) achieve fast kinetics towards Gr anode and high oxidation stability. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Gr LIBs can reach 80% state of the charge in 6&#160;min, and the Ah&#8208;level energy&#8208;dense pouch cells (4.5 V) retain 82.96% (500 cycles) and 85.94% (200 cycles) of initial capacities at room temperature and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Our work deepens the fundamental understanding of Li&#8208;ion solvation structures and affords an effective approach to design sustainable fluro&#8208;free electrolytes for battery systems.

         <title>Perovskite Homojunction Solar Cells by Buried Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite p&#8211;n homojunction is constructed via a simple perovskite buried interface engineering. Thanks to the driven force induced by the homojunction, charge carriers are efficiently extracted, and the corresponding perovskite homojunction solar cell achieves a champion efficiency of 25.0%.








Abstract
Constructing a strong p&#8211;n junction is an effective strategy to drive the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and boost the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, forming p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconductors in perovskites is not as straightforward as in archetypal Si by doping electron&#8208;accepting and electron&#8208;donating elements. Here, we observe the transition of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type characteristics in a perovskite layer via buried interface engineering. The perfluorinated copper phthalocyanine (F16CuPc) molecules with strong electronegativity are employed to modify the NiOx/Me&#8208;2PACz substrate, which not only facilitates the crystallization of the perovskite, but also induces the formation of p&#8208;type perovskite at its buried interface. We observe a gradual shift of the Fermi level from near valence band at the perovskite buried interface to near conduction band at the perovskite top surface, manifesting the transition from p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type within the monolithic perovskite layer. Such a p&#8211;n homojunction provides an extra electric field for accelerating charge carrier transportation, and thus enhances the device photovoltaic performance. The F16CuPc induced perovskite homojunction solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 25.0% and it retained over 80% of its initial efficiency for more than 1100&#160;h. We believe that the perovskite homojunction strategy will also pave the way for other perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe that can selectively label the family Lachnospiraceae in vivo and in vitro is reported. The labeling position of LAA probe is the 1st amino acid of the bacterial PGN stem peptide. The unusually large volume of the inner space in the crystal structure of Roseburia faecis MurC implies its higher tolerance for substrates to some extent.








Abstract
Developing selective labeling probes for specific bacterial taxa can not only facilitate the study of target bacteria but also deepen our understanding of the microbial diversity at structural and molecular levels. The availability of such probes, however, remains very limited. In this study, by exploiting the variation of amino acids in peptidoglycan stem peptide, we designed a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe and found that it can selectively target the family Lachnospiraceae (a major Gram&#8208;positive family in murine gut microbiome) in vivo. The following in vitro test using two Roseburia species belonging to this family validated labeling by the probe. We then discovered that the labeling site is the first amino acid (L&#8208;alanine in most bacteria), which links the stem peptide with N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid, a process catalyzed by a highly conserved enzyme MurC. An enzyme assay of Roseburia MurC demonstrated its ability to conjugate a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid and other non&#8208;L&#8208;Ala amino acids to UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid. Subsequent X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis uncovered a substantially enlarged inner space in this enzyme, which can partially explain its tolerance to these atypical substrates. The resulting unusual peptidoglycan structures lead to significantly reduced activation of the NOD immune receptors, suggesting a new mechanism for the host to accommodate these highly abundant commensals.

         <title>Exceptionally High Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Cross Sections&#160;in Quinoidal Diazaacene&#8208;Bithiophene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking new horizons in two&#8208;photon absorption, this study uncovers how specially structured quinoidal&#8208;bithiophene derivatives achieve remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections&#160;in the near&#8208;infrared range. Advanced calculations reveal the interplay of molecular symmetry and strong state coupling, shedding light on the mechanism behind their efficiency&#8212;potentially transforming fields like bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, and optical data storage.








Abstract
This study addresses the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) properties of (azaacene&#8208;annulated) heterophenoquinones through a synergistic approach combining detailed experimental and theoretical analyses. Exceptionally large 2PA cross sections&#160;are found over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region, with values up to 4100 GM in the 1400&#8211;1600&#160;nm range and even higher values of up to 51770&#160;GM in the 850&#8211;950&#160;nm range, which is outstanding for organic chromophores of this molecular size. Our quantum chemical calculations support the experimental findings and elucidate the underlying absorption mechanism leading to the corresponding 2PA properties. The occurrence of such large cross sections&#160;is explained by the high oscillator strength of the first excited singlet state and its strong coupling to higher excited electronic states. The large (state&#8208;to&#8208;state) transition dipole moments originate from the acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor structure of the parent quinoidal bithiophene motif common to all compounds, which in addition also enables their optimal (anti)parallel alignment due to its symmetry and&#160;linearity.

         <title>Interfacial Mesochannels as Cation Pump for Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a cation pump strategy, we demonstrate enhanced cation selectivity and osmotic energy harvesting by a mechanically robust and stable MCNTs@mSiO2/ANF composite membrane. The interfacial mesochannels facilitate cation enrichment and drive a continuous cation flow into the interfiber spaces, thus promoting membrane ion selectivity and permeability simultaneously.








Abstract
Membranes integrating 1D materials are rapidly emerging as highly promising platforms for osmotic energy harvesting. However, their power output is often constrained by insufficient ion selectivity. Herein, we demonstrate a cation pumping strategy by designing mesoporous silica coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes/aramid nanofiber (MCNTs@mSiO2/ANF) composite membranes as osmotic power generators. Cations can be initially enriched in the negatively charged and small&#8208;pore&#8208;sized (&#8764; 3&#160;nm) interfacial mesopore channels, establishing a strong cation concentration gradient toward the interfiber nanochannels. The gradient continuously drives cations into the interfiber pores, facilitating charge separation, and improving ion selectivity. Additionally, the hydrophilic nature of the mesoporous silica shells promotes ion transport and contributes to high ion flux. Consequently, the fabricated MCNTs@mSiO2/ANF composite nanochannel membranes can deliver a notable power density of 8.24&#160;W m&#8722;2 with an excellent ion selectivity of 0.91 under a 50&#8208;fold NaCl salinity gradient. Importantly, the membranes demonstrate long&#8208;term stability for osmotic energy capturing. When placed between natural seawater and river water, the composite membranes yield an impressive power density of 9.93&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2, surpassing that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 1D material&#8208;based membranes. This work paves the way for the practical applications of nanofiber&#8208;based membranes in sustainable osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Routes to Pt Derivatives of High&#8208;Valent Sulfur Oxofluorides S(&#9552;O)2F, S(&#9552;O)F2, and S(&#9552;O)F3 by Fluorination and Oxygenation</title>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the controlled functionalization of a SOF ligand at a platinum center, achieving the selective formation of SO2F and SOF2 complexes by fluorination or oxygenation. Further fluorination of the SOF2 ligand resulted in an unprecedented SOF3 metal derivative, which is a unique example of a high&#8208;valent fluorinated sulfur atom coordinated to a metal center. 








Abstract
Metal derivatives of high&#8208;valent sulfur fluorides and oxofluorides can provid e fluorinated building blocks for materials science and bioactive compounds, but so far, such building blocks are elusive. The paper describes routes to access remarkable metal derivatives of S(&#9552;O)2F, S(&#9552;O)F2, and S(&#9552;O)F3 by oxygenation or fluorination steps. The Pt(II) fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(PCy3)2] (2) reacts with the Davis reagent (3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxaziridine) to yield the sulfuryl fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SO2F)(PCy3)2] (4). Notably, the electrophilic fluorinating agent NFSI (N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide) reacts with 2 to form trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF2)(PCy3)2][NFSO2Ph] (5a). By nucleophilic fluorination with TMAF (Me4NF) it is possible to fluorinate the sulfur center once more to give the complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF3)(PCy3)2] (6) bearing an unprecedented SOF3 ligand. Above 283&#160;K, complex 6 shows a decomposition of the SOF3 moiety to form trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(PCy3)2] (7) and SOF2. The described complexes could represent a previously unknown class of transfer reagents for high&#8208;valent sulfur fluoride units.

We demonstrate an antisolvent&#8208;regulated NO3&#8722; anion coordination effect for high&#8208;performance LMBs. The addition of TTE enhances the interaction between the NO3&#8722; anion and solvent to Li+, resulting in an increase in ion&#8208;pair formation. This also induces a transformation of the NO3&#8722; anion from a monodentate to a bidentate coordination configuration, facilitating preferential nitrate reduction at the anode interface. The optimized electrolyte shows remarkable cycling stability in lithium metal anode and Li||LFP full cells.








Abstract
The fabrication of NO3&#8722; anion&#8208;participating solvation sheaths to derive inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers is critical for enhancing the stabilization of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the application of LiNO3 salt is limited by its low solubility and the challenge of controlling NO3&#8722; coordination, primarily due to its high donor number. Herein, we demonstrate an antisolvent&#8208;enhanced anionic coordination effect in urea&#8208;based LiNO3 electrolytes for boosting the cycling stability of LMBs. We find that the incorporation of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) into these electrolytes enhances the interaction between the NO3&#8722; anion and urea&#8208;based solvent to Li+ in the solvation sheath, resulting in an increase in ion&#8208;pair formation. This also induces a transformation of the NO3&#8722; anion from a monodentate to a bidentate coordination configuration, facilitating preferential nitrate reduction at the anode interface. The optimized electrolyte formulation demonstrates remarkable cycling stability in lithium metal anode, achieving 6000&#160;h of operation in a Li||Li cell and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% in a Li||Cu cell. In full&#8208;cell testing, Li||LiFePO4 cells (N/P&#160;=&#160;3) maintain 88% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.2C.

         <title>A Rigid, Stable, and Scalable Aliphatic MOF Adsorbent for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation with Record Acetylene Packing Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylated aliphatic acids effectively modulate the heterogeneity of secondary building units, yielding a rigid framework with enhanced C2H2 capture capacity and achieving record&#8208;high storage density. Furthermore, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations demonstrate exceptional C2H2/CO2 separation performance.








Abstract
Integrating separation parameters such as high adsorption capacity and selectivity, moderate adsorption enthalpy (Qst), along with industrial factors including cyclic stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability into a single adsorbent remains highly challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs among these properties. Herein, we strategically leverage the coordination modes of aliphatic ligands to significantly enhance C2H2/CO2 separation performance. The structure flexibility and pore metrics are finely modulated by hydroxylated aliphatic acid (DLmal). As a result, the rigid Zn&#8208;bpy&#8208;DLmal exhibits an exceptional C2H2 adsorption capacity of 1.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar, high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (49), and moderate C2H2 Qst value (38.4&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Notably, it achieves record&#8208;high C2H2 packing densities of 347&#160;g L&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar and 747&#160;g L&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;bar. Furthermore, the scale&#8208;up production of Zn&#8208;bpy&#8208;DLmal to kilogram quantities has been successfully achieved at an estimated cost of $74 per kilogram. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm its practical C2H2/CO2 separation performance with excellent cyclability under high flow rates and both dry and humid conditions. Moreover, two&#8208;bed pressure swing adsorption simulations demonstrate a high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt;99%) yield of 14.64&#160;mol with a recovery of 88.2% per cycle.

         <title>Coupling Zn2+ Ferrying Effect With Anion&#8211;&#960; Interaction to Mitigate Space Charge Layer Enables Ultra&#8208;High Utilization Rate Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;anion&#8211;cation co&#8208;regulation&#8221; strategy, associated with a fundamental principle for screening potential electrolyte additives coupling the Zn2+ ferrying effect with anion&#8211;&#960; interaction, is put forward to construct a dendrite&#8208;free, high&#8208;ZUR Zn anode. By constructing the ion&#8208;rich interface to retard the negative impact of the space charge layer, our Zn anode can endure &#8764;240&#160;h continuous cycling at an ultrahigh ZUR of 87.3%.








Abstract
A major dilemma faced by Zn anodes at a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is the insufficient supply of ionic carriers that initiate the space charge layer (SCL) subject to the rampant growth of Zn dendrites. Herein, an &#8220;anion&#8211;cation co&#8208;regulation&#8221; strategy, associated with a fundamental principle for screening potential electrolyte additives coupling the Zn2+ ferrying effect with anion&#8208;retention capability, is put forward to construct dendrite&#8208;free, high&#8208;ZUR Zn anode. Taking ninhydrin&#8208;modified ZnSO4 system as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the multiple zincophilic polar groups of ninhydrin facilitate the transport of Zn2+ ions, while its electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ring retains SO42&#8722; counterions via anion&#8211;&#960; interaction, constructing an ion&#8208;rich interface that minimizes the SCL&#8208;driven Zn deterioration. Consequently, the Zn anode can endure &#8764;240&#160;h continuous cycling at an ultrahigh ZUR of 87.3%. The superiority brought by ninhydrin is further reflected by the ultralong cycling durability of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (over 100&#160;000 cycles). Even at an ultralow N/P ratio of 1.1 (&#8764;90.6% ZUR), the battery with a capacity of &#8764;5.27&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 can still sustain for 350 cycles, which has been hardly achieved in aqueous Zn batteries. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this strategy is fully validated by a series of additives sharing similar fundamentals.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Optimized Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Enhanced Stability at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>

The Zn&#8208;ion battery operated at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C exhibited significantly enhanced cycling stability than that working at room temperature. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations results suggest that the changes of electrolyte at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C decrease the water activity and hinder H+ diffusion along the H&#8208;bond network via the Grotthuss mechanism, thereby mitigating the harmful H+&#8208;associated reactions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have been extensively studied under room and ultralow temperature conditions. However, mechanism studies at intermediate temperature ranges remain limited. In this work, we investigate the electrochemical performance of an AZIB using a commonly employed 3&#160;M ZnSO4 electrolyte across the intermediate temperature range of 25 to &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C. Notably, we find that the battery with a double hydroxide cathode exhibits optimized performance at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced cycling stability compared to 25&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic studies reveal that unfavorable H+&#8208;associated reactions at both the cathode and anode are effectively alleviated at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, contributing to improved cycling stability. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyzes show that changes in the electrolyte environment at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C&#8212;such as reduced electrochemical activity of H2O, increased H&#8208;bond strength, and decreased total number of H bonds&#8212;impede H+ diffusion through H&#8208;bond network via the Grotthuss mechanism. These effects collectively suppress harmful H+&#8208;associated reactions, allowing Zn2+ insertion/deinsertion to dominate the charge storage process. This work provides valuable insights into the enhanced performance of AZIBs at sublow temperatures and presents opportunities for extending battery operation in near&#8208;freezing environments.

Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations results suggest that the changes of electrolyte at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C decrease the water activity and hinder H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion along the H-bond network via the Grotthuss mechanism, thereby mitigating the harmful H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-associated reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have been extensively studied under room and ultralow temperature conditions. However, mechanism studies at intermediate temperature ranges remain limited. In this work, we investigate the electrochemical performance of an AZIB using a commonly employed 3&#160;M ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte across the intermediate temperature range of 25 to &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C. Notably, we find that the battery with a double hydroxide cathode exhibits optimized performance at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced cycling stability compared to 25&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic studies reveal that unfavorable H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-associated reactions at both the cathode and anode are effectively alleviated at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, contributing to improved cycling stability. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyzes show that changes in the electrolyte environment at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C&#8212;such as reduced electrochemical activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, increased H-bond strength, and decreased total number of H bonds&#8212;impede H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion through H-bond network via the Grotthuss mechanism. These effects collectively suppress harmful H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-associated reactions, allowing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion/deinsertion to dominate the charge storage process. This work provides valuable insights into the enhanced performance of AZIBs at sublow temperatures and presents opportunities for extending battery operation in near-freezing environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Activatable Caged Palladium Nanocomposite for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduced a multi&#8208;functional composite consisting of Pd nanoparticles, encapsulated in molecular cages, co&#8208;loaded with glucose oxidase and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;hyaluronic acid conjugate, acting as an effective activatable carrier for cancer therapy. It exhibits bioorthogonal catalytic and multi&#8208;enzyme mimicking activities, which can be selectively activated in the tumor and enable spatially targeted intracellular catalysis for therapy.








Abstract
Pd&#8208;based intracellular catalysis has attracted increasing interest in modulating biological processes or disease treatment. The unsatisfactory catalytic efficiency arising from limited active sites and poor water solubility of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and their &#8220;always on&#8221; catalytic activities pose, however, significant limitations. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;performance nanocomposite based on ultrafine Pd NPs confined within molecular cages, and incorporated with glucose oxidase (GOx) and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA). The cage&#8208;confined strategy enables facile synthesis of ultrafine Pd NPs with more accessible active sites, significantly improving the catalytic activities of Pd NPs for enhanced bioorthogonal catalysis. Importantly, the nanocomposite exhibits targeting ability and activatable activity in response to both the acidic pH and hyaluronidase overexpressed in the tumor environment, enabling selective drug synthesis. Besides, it features CAT&#8208;, OXD&#8208;, and GPx&#8208;like activities, promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and intracellular GSH depletion to elevate oxidative stress for enhanced therapy. The cage&#8208;confined configuration makes it possible to establish metal&#8208;based intracellular catalytic systems with high performance, enabling the synthesis of desired molecules for effective disease theranostics.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Buffered Electron Shuttle of Ru/RuO2 with Switchable Active Sites Enables Robust and Efficient Bifunctional Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fullerene&#8208;buffered electron shuttle of Ru/RuO2 serves as robust and efficient electrocatalyst for alkaline overall water splitting (OWS). Benefiting from the electron shuttle effect on inhibition of structural reconstruction and electronic structural modulation, the photovoltaic&#8208;driven OWS device with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 18.9% and an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis system at the current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 200 h was fabricated.








Abstract
Developing highly&#8208;efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (OWS) is desirable, but it confronts long&#8208;term challenge in the local structural reconstruction of catalyst during the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). As inspired by the stable acid&#8211;base buffer system in human life, here we construct an electron buffer system to well address the key issue of structural reconstruction, in which the charge&#8208;buffered fullerene renders Ru&#8208;based active species to be reversibly shuttled between Ru and RuO2 during HER and OER. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Ru&#8208;RuO2/C60&#8208;x catalyst exhibits overpotentials of merely 7 and 194&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER in alkaline conditions, respectively. The photovoltaic&#8208;driven OWS device with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 18.9% and an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) system with good robustness was fabricated based on Ru&#8208;RuO2/C60&#8208;x. It was unraveled by in situ/operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculation that the significantly promoted performance of water electrolysis benefits from the fullerene&#8208;based electron shuttle effect on inhibition of structural reconstruction and electronic structural modulation of active sites as well as adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates. Our work may open an avenue to develop efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for promising industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Chiral Zinc Sulfide Nanoparticles Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species for Remodeling Intestinal Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>

Chiral zinc sulfide nanoparticles induced by l&#8208;/d&#8208;cysteine, as nanodrugs, effectively reduced inflammation and modulated the gut microbiota, which played a significant role in the treatment and prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and provided crucial support for the development of therapeutic strategies for diseases.








Abstract
Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gut microbiota dysbiosis are crucial factors that exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#160;To address this, we successfully synthesized zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) with a particle size of approximately 500&#160;nm and a maximum g&#8208;factor of 0.07, utilizing l&#8208;/d&#8208;cysteine as chiral ligands. Chirality gives NPs unique bioactivity. These chiral ZnS NPs could enter macrophages through the CD44 and clathrin pathways, which enhanced the ability to scavenge ROS, in turn significantly inhibited the NF&#8208;&#954;B and NLRP3 signaling pathways, thereby reducing the secretion of TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;6, and IL&#8208;1&#946;, while upregulating IL&#8208;10. In vivo experimental data showed that l&#8208;ZnS NPs outperformed 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, significantly improving body weight, reducing the IBD activity index, and attenuating tissue damage. Concurrently, l&#8208;ZnS NPs exhibited a marked prophylactic effect. The benchmark studies verified that l&#8208;ZnS NPs increased the abundance of the beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 by 10.55&#8208;fold and decreased harmful Enterobacter by 2914.00&#8208;fold, thereby reshaping the intestinal microecological balance. Pharmacokinetic and biosafety assessments confirmed the safety of l&#8208;ZnS NPs.&#160;Our findings indicate that chiral ZnS NPs hold great potential as nanodrugs for the treatment and prevention of IBD, providing an important foundation for the development of IBD therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photoconversion of a Discrete Mixed Iodine(I) System to a 1D Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex, which contained three distinct iodine(I) moieties, was synthesized using 4&#8208;styrylpyridine and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalate. This complex underwent a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to UV light, converting the discrete salt to a 1D polymer while retaining the iodine(I) moieties and represents the only example of a nondestructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex.








Abstract
The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex (2), containing three distinct iodine(I) moieties ([N&#8213;I&#8213;N]+, O&#8213;I&#8213;N, and [O&#8213;I&#8213;O]&#8722;) within the same structure, was synthesized with 4&#8208;styrylpyridine (4&#8208;stypy) and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalate as the stabilizing Lewis bases. This complex was observed to be in equilibrium with its respective bis(OIN) complex (1a), with isolated samples of 2 also being found to convert to 1a in solution. Upon UV irradiation of 2, a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction was observed, converting the discrete salt 2 to the 1D polymer 5. Complex 5 retained all the iodine(I) moieties from prior to photoconversion and represents the first example of nondestructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex. To facilitate comparisons to 2 and 5, several additional closely related iodine(I) complexes were synthesized, with the iodine(I) complexes characterized by NMR (1H, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC) and SCXRD, as well as by Raman and IR spectroscopy for 2, 5, and their close structural analogue 1a.

     alt="Solid-State Photoconversion of a Discrete Mixed Iodine(I) System to a 1D Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex, which contained three distinct iodine(I) moieties, was synthesized using 4-styrylpyridine and 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorophthalate. This complex underwent a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation when exposed to UV light, converting the discrete salt to a 1D polymer while retaining the iodine(I) moieties and represents the only example of a nondestructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), containing three distinct iodine(I) moieties ([N&#8213;I&#8213;N]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, O&#8213;I&#8213;N, and [O&#8213;I&#8213;O]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) within the same structure, was synthesized with 4-styrylpyridine (4-stypy) and 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorophthalate as the stabilizing Lewis bases. This complex was observed to be in equilibrium with its respective &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(OIN) complex (&lt;b&gt;1a&lt;/b&gt;), with isolated samples of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; also being found to convert to &lt;b&gt;1a&lt;/b&gt; in solution. Upon UV irradiation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, a single-crystal-to-single-crystal [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction was observed, converting the discrete salt &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to the 1D polymer &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Complex &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; retained all the iodine(I) moieties from prior to photoconversion and represents the first example of nondestructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex.

         <title>Controlling the Chirality of Metallo&#8208;Cages by Manipulating the Stereochemistry of the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the dynamics of ZnII and CdII ions are approximately the same, the stereochemistry of 1&#8208;ZnII12L18 and 2&#8208;CdII12L18 cuboctahedra induced by the same chiral guests (D&#8208;/L&#8208;camphorsulfonate) was opposite, thus enabling manipulation of the chirality of the metallo&#8208;cages through the metal ions. Spontaneous resolution of 3&#8208;ZnII12L28 into enantiopure individual crystals was achieved by changing the ligand's substituent to 2&#8208;methylphenylethyl.








Abstract
Precise control over the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages by manipulating the stereochemistry of metal centers is important in many practical applications, but is extremely challenging. In this study, two isostructural metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra (1&#8208;ZnII12L18 and 2&#8208;CdII12L18) have been assembled using ligand L1 and two kinds of metal ions (ZnII and CdII) with similar coordination lability. The chiral&#8208;induction by the same guests (D&#8208;/L&#8208;camphorsulfonate, D&#8208;/L&#8208;SCS) results in a completely opposing stereochemical output of 1 and 2: D&#8208;SCS induced host&#8211;guest complex of [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#916;12&#8211;1] and [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#923;12&#8211;2], respectively, with reverse handedness. The distinct stereochemical configuration of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra can be manipulated by participant metal ions that exhibit similar dynamics. Furthermore, a subtle variation of the ligand peripheral substituent group facilitates spontaneous resolution of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra 3&#8208;ZnII12L28 from a racemic mixture as (R24, &#923;12)&#8208;3/(S24, &#916;12)&#8208;3 enantiopure entities. The dynamic stereochemistry of MII12L8 cuboctahedra described in this work allows a chiral manipulation based on the nature of metal centers and ligands, enabling the design and control of the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Euphane Triterpenoids Using Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate undergoes metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer, yielding unprecedented cyclization products via alkene cycloisomerization or cyclization&#8208;elimination pathways. This methodology enables an efficient synthetic strategy to deliver four natural products: euphol, 25,26,27&#8208;trisnor&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;euphan&#8208;24&#8208;al, euphorbiumrin D, and 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;tirucall&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione.








Abstract
Euphane triterpenoids are widely distributed in nature and show various intriguing bioactivities, but relatively few synthetic routes to them have been described. Here, we report asymmetric convergent total syntheses of euphanes involving two triterpenoids and two nortriterpenoids: euphol, 25,26,27&#8208;trisnor&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;euphan&#8208;24&#8208;al, euphorbiumrin D, and 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;tirucall&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The syntheses employ an enantioselective Antilla allylboration and intramolecular radical cyclization to construct ring A, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Liebeskind stannane&#8208;thioester coupling to connect ring A with the bicyclic CD system, and a novel radical cascade with metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) to complete the polycyclic architecture. The late&#8208;stage syntheses of both triterpenoids feature a diimide reduction and a MHAT/1,5&#8208;hydrogen transfer cascade to diastereoselectively forge the C20 and C17 stereogenic centers.

         <title>Low&#8208;Entropy and Fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;Conducting Electrolyte With Cascade Reaction&#8208;Induced Robust Interphase for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A low&#8208;entropy and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;conducting electrolyte with cascade reaction&#8208;induced stabilized interfacial phase and fast Li+ transport kinetics has been designed, and the electrolyte formulation can provide excellent fast cycling performance of lithium metal batteries. This work emphasizes an effective electrolyte design strategy and gives a new design idea to facilitate the practical application of fast&#8208;charging LMBs.








Abstract
Lithium metal is considered the most promising next&#8208;generation anode, while its fast&#8208;charging application is hindered by the problems of dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a low&#8208;entropy electrolyte with cascade reaction&#8208;induced stable interphase and fast Li+ transport kinetics is proposed to provide excellent fast&#8208;charging performance of lithium metal batteries. In this electrolyte with an extremely simple formula, only two co&#8208;solvents with a lithium salt are used without any other additives. Fast lithium transport and desolvation kinetics are maintained, owing to the solvents&#8217; low viscosity and weak interaction with lithium. Particularly, the intermediate products of lithium salt can further promote rapid defluorination of the F&#8208;containing solvent to form LiF, constructing a LiF&#8208;rich interphase. Fast Li+ transport kinetics and robust interphase enable the fast&#8208;cycling performance of lithium metal anodes. The Li||Li symmetric cell can even withstand a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Good cycling stability under fast charging is also achieved with a capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained with a capacity retention rate reaching 90% after 200 cycles at a charging rate of 6C. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective electrolyte design strategy facilitating the fast cycling of lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Insertion of Nitriles Into a Gold(III)/Carbene Bond: A Direct and Powerful Entry to Imino&#8208;Substituted Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable imino&#8208;substituted Au(III) carbenes are easily and efficiently prepared by trapping the transient (N^C^C)Au&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene with nitriles. The corresponding free species are readily generated and display dual carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivities. The diazo decomposition, nitrile insertion, and carbene transfer can be combined in three&#8208;component Au(III)&#8208;catalyzed transformations.








Abstract
Strikingly, very little is known so far about reactive gold(III) carbenes. They have been proposed as key intermediates in a few reactions but remain chemical curiosities. Taking into account the enhanced electrophilicity of cationic Au(III) carbene complexes, we were intrigued by their reactivity with nitriles. Thus, we discovered a simple and efficient entry to imino&#8208;substituted carbenes. The transient (N^C^C)Au(III)&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene readily reacts with acetonitrile, benzonitrile, and diisopropyl cyanamide, affording stable and isolable Au(III) carbene complexes. Here, the imino group acts either as a strongly &#960;&#8208;donating or a spectator substituent. Ligand exchange at Au(III) or protodeauration/deprotonation provides access to the corresponding free species, which display dual imino&#8208;carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivity, as substantiated by stoichiometric and catalytic dimerization, O&#9472;H insertion and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions.

         <dc:description>
A novel molecular platform characteristic of multiple transition metals (CH&#9472;Zn, CH&#9472;Ni, CH&#9472;Pt) on conjugated backbones, is first established by fusing porphyrin core with the widely used S,N&#8208;heteroacene. 








Abstract
A novel molecular platform characteristic of multiple transition metals (CH&#9472;Zn, CH&#9472;Ni, CH&#9472;Pt) on conjugated backbones is first established as high&#8208;performance electron acceptors. The CH&#9472;Pt&#8208;based ternary organic photovoltaics render an excellent power conversion efficiency surpassing 20%, more importantly, the unexplored dependency of central metals on intrinsic physicochemical properties of acceptors, nanoscale morphologies of donor/acceptor blends and final photovoltaic outcomes is fully disclosed. By demonstrating such a rare case of metal&#8208;containing acceptor, our work provides insight into whether metal complexes can serve as the building blocks of high&#8208;performance acceptors and gives guidance to rational design of metal&#8208;containing acceptors.

         <title>Dynamic Borate Esterification for Evolved Supramolecular Chirality and Chiral Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of the borate esterification reaction between pyrene&#8208;modified phenylalanine and catechol derivatives enables to construct coassembled systems that exhibit dynamic evolved supramolecular chirality. This coassembly undergoes spontaneous and highly efficient borate esterification under ambient conditions, inducing nanoscale morphological evolution, an inversion of supramolecular chirality and circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Topological chemical reactions in confined environments offer unique opportunities for constructing dynamically tunable crystalline materials and architecturally defined polymers. However, their potential within functional supramolecular systems and chiral materials remains largely untapped. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a borate esterification reaction to achieve dynamic modulation of supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties under aggregation conditions. Pyrene&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives, following functionalization with phenylboronic acid groups, coassemble with catechol&#8208;functionalized pyrene derivatives. This coassembly undergoes spontaneous and highly efficient borate esterification under ambient conditions, inducing nanoscale morphological evolution, and an inversion of supramolecular chirality. Both experimental results and DFT&#8208;based computations reveal that the supramolecular chirality inversion is primarily driven by a transition from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking to CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between pyrene moieties. This coassembly&#8208;borate esterification process represents a powerful integration of noncovalent assembly and covalent chemistry, providing a versatile platform for the design of soft materials and chiral functional systems. Moreover, the introduction of alizarin derivatives containing catechol motifs enables the transfer of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), resulting in tunable emission shifts from blue and cyan to red. This work broadens the functional scope of chiral luminescent materials and opens new avenues for their application.

         <title>Enhanced p&#8211;d Orbital Coupling in Unconventional Phase RhSb Alloy Nanoflowers for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin rhodium&#8211;antimony alloy nanoflowers with unconventional 2H phase were controllably synthesized via a facile one&#8208;pot method. Benefitting from the enhanced electronic interaction by p&#8211;d orbital coupling, the prepared catalyst delivered an efficient ammonia electrosynthesis capacity in neutral media.








Abstract
Phase control provides a promising approach for physicochemical property modulation of metal/alloy nanomaterials toward various electrocatalytic applications. However, the controlled synthesis of alloy nanomaterials with unconventional phases remains challenging, especially for those containing both p&#8208; and d&#8208;block metals. Here, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ultrathin RhSb alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with an unconventional 2H phase. Using 2H RhSb NFs as an electrocatalyst for nitrite reduction reaction in neutral media, the optimal NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate can reach up to 96.8% and 47.2&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3 and &#8722;0.6&#160;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. With 2H RhSb NFs as a bifunctional cathode catalyst, the as&#8208;assembled zinc&#8208;nitrite/methanol batteries deliver a high energy efficiency of 96.4% and improved rechargeability with 120&#8208;h stable running. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the phase change of RhSb from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to 2H has optimized the electronic structure through stronger interactions between Rh and Sb by p&#8211;d orbital couplings, which improves the adsorption of key intermediates and reduces the reaction barriers of nitrite reduction to guarantee the efficient electrocatalysis. This work offers a feasible strategy of boosting the electrocatalytic performance of alloy nanostructures by integrating phase control and p&#8211;d orbital coupling.

         <title>Temperature and Solvent Dual Switch Photochromic Chiral Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Advanced Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;gated photochromic ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (iHOF) for smart&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;information cryptomaterials with an enhanced circular polarization tendency at low temperatures has been synthesized using a charge&#8208;assisted strategy. These findings confirm the feasibility of iHOFs as a new generation of crystalline, multifunctional, circularly polarized, and luminescent materials.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;response encryption materials with temperature control and time resolution have attracted widespread attention due to their unique response characteristics and higher application security. The design and development of photochromic crystalline materials with multiple stimulus responses remain challenging. In this study, we report a pair of responsive photochromic chiral ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (iHOF) R/S&#8208;iHOF&#8208;19, controlled by both temperature and solvent through charge&#8208;assisted synthesis. The chromophore tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE) acts as an electron donor and (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine (R/S&#8208;DPEN) as an electron acceptor and chiral source. Water and methanol molecules connect the donor and acceptor and interact to build a 3D supramolecular framework. Notably, water and methanol molecules form independent hydrogen&#8208;bonding channels within the iHOF structural framework, providing a transfer path for the photoinduced electrons.

&lt;p&gt;A temperature-gated photochromic ionic hydrogen-bonded organic framework (iHOF) for smart-responsive multi-information cryptomaterials with an enhanced circular polarization tendency at low temperatures has been synthesized using a charge-assisted strategy. These findings confirm the feasibility of iHOFs as a new generation of crystalline, multifunctional, circularly polarized, and luminescent materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-response encryption materials with temperature control and time resolution have attracted widespread attention due to their unique response characteristics and higher application security. The design and development of photochromic crystalline materials with multiple stimulus responses remain challenging. In this study, we report a pair of responsive photochromic chiral ionic hydrogen-bonded organic framework (iHOF) R/S-iHOF-19, controlled by both temperature and solvent through charge-assisted synthesis. The chromophore tetrakis(4-sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE) acts as an electron donor and (1R/S,2R/S)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine (R/S-DPEN) as an electron acceptor and chiral source. Water and methanol molecules connect the donor and acceptor and interact to build a 3D supramolecular framework. Notably, water and methanol molecules form independent hydrogen-bonding channels within the iHOF structural framework, providing a transfer path for the photoinduced electrons. Surprisingly, the formation of a continuous chiral supramolecular framework by R/S-DPEN while generating photo-induced radicals under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C imparts excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties to R/S-iHOF-19. The glum values reach &#8722;1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and&#160;+3.75&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and show an enhancement of the circular polarization of light with decreasing temperature. This CPL with unique low-temperature stimulus-responsive photochromism provides new guidance and perspectives for the development of information security and multiple encryption materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peripheral Engineering of Multiple&#8208;Resonance Framework Targeting Efficient Organic Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational peripheral engineering of multiple&#8208;resonance cores is shown to be critical for modulating molecular interactions, excited&#8208;state dynamics, and lasing performance. Extending &#960;&#8211;conjugation by introducing phenyl groups induces severe aggregation and broadens the excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA), whereas unconjugated tert&#8208;butyl groups suppress molecular aggregation and separate the ESA band away from the lasing region, leading to an optimal lasing performance.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as promising candidates for organic laser applications due to the potential for simultaneously achieving large oscillator strength and triplet utilization. In this study, we investigate the impact of peripheral tert&#8208;butyl (t&#8208;Bu)&#8208; and phenyl (Ph)&#8208;substituents on the typical 9&#8208;(phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;3&#8208;carbonitrile (CzBN) MR framework. Although these modifications preserve the frontier molecular orbital distribution with large oscillator strengths, they significantly influence excited&#8208;state dynamics and molecular aggregation even at low doping concentrations. Introducing Ph substituents extends the &#960;&#8211;conjugation extension of CzBN, promoting closer molecular packing, detrimental molecular aggregation, and significantly broadening the excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) band, which negatively impacts lasing performance. In contrast, CzBN&#8208;tBu, incorporating t&#8208;Bu groups as nonconjugated substituents, demonstrated reduced molecular aggregation and a distinct separation between the ESA band and stimulated emission region. Consequently, the optimal distributed feedback lasing performance is achieved by CzBN&#8208;tBu across various doping concentrations, resulting in the lowest lasing threshold of 3.4&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. These findings underscore the impact of inherent aggregation at low doping ratios on lasing activities, highlighting the crucial role of rational peripheral engineering in modulating molecular interactions and excited&#8208;state dynamics, offering design strategies for developing MR lasing molecules.

         <title>H2S Sensing with SnO2&#8208;Based Gas Sensors: Sulfur Poisoning Mechanism Revealed by Operando DRIFTS and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of sticky sulfite and sulfate surface species is identified as the root cause of the poisoning effect of H2S on SnO2&#8208;based sensors by the compelling results and detailed analyses from operando DRIFTS experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time detection of toxic and flammable H2S remains challenging for cost&#8208;effective semiconducting metal oxide (SMOX) sensors due to the insufficient focus on and inherently poor understanding of the sulfur&#8208;poisoning effect. This research, focusing on SnO2 as a model for SMOX sensors, identifies the formation of sticky sulfite and sulfate surface species as the root cause of poisoning through the detailed analyses of results obtained from operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The formation of the poisoning species is highly energetically favorable. Meanwhile, the decomposition of sulfite and sulfate appears unfavorable at the typical operating temperature of 300 &#176;C and is only feasible around the literature&#8208;reported 500&#160;&#176;C. The sulfur poisoning effect is also likely to occur with SO2 and other sulfur&#8208;containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Overcoming this issue is expected to require surface additives and/or alternative SMOX materials capable of providing different reaction pathways. The significance of metal&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxygen chemistry extends beyond SMOX gas sensors to desulfurization catalysts, denitration catalysts, and solid oxide fuel cells.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;Like (Cyclo)Addition of Small Organic Molecules to a Stable Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azomethine ylide is shown to activate a series of H&#9472;E (E&#9552;B, Si, Al, O) and B&#9472;B bonds in &#8220;Frustrated Lewis pair&#8221; (FLP)&#8208;like fashion. A transfer hydrogenation from NH3&#8226;BH3 is also accomplished. DFT analyses suggest each activation route to be mechanistically distinct than others. The ylide also undergoes 3+2&#8208;cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles, among which the facile insertion of CS2 but non&#8208;insertion of CO2 is compelling but justified by computing the associated energetics.








Abstract
Azomethine ylides are 1,3&#8208;dipolar zwitterions typically used for constructing N&#8208;heterocycles by 3+2&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. We report here a pyridyl&#8208;tethered isolable azomethine ylide (AY) that activates a series of H&#8722;E bonds (E&#9552;B, Si, Al, O) in FLP&#8208;like fashion. The reactions are probed mechanistically by DFT calculations and each case appears to be distinct from others. While the HBpin activation is stepwise, the same of PhSiH3 is concerted. The AlH3 activation is also stepwise but takes place across the 1,5&#8208;(C+/N&#8722;) dipole. The hydrolysis of AY fits better with a &#8220;relay&#8221; mechanism with two H2O molecules working in tandem. The B&#8722;B bond of B2pin2 is also cleaved but in an intriguingly different way, by delivering both the Bpin moieties at the carbenic site. Though the challenging H2 activation fails, a transfer hydrogenation of AY by NH3&#8226;BH3 is readily achieved. AY also undergoes cycloadditions with various dipolarophiles including unactivated alkene and alkynes. In this regard, AY makes an interesting distinction between CO2 and CS2 by staying inert to the former but easily cycloadding the latter. DFT analysis justifies this dichotomy by showing the cycloaddition of CO2 as thermodynamically disfavored.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens Enable Optical Logic Gates Toward Lighting, Scintillators, and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of pressure to non&#8208;emissive 0D metal halide (C25H22P)2SnCl6 ultimately resulted in bright emission. Note that the quenched (C25H22P)2SnCl6 after pressure treatment of 20.0&#160;GPa exhibited very bright blue&#8211;white emission. Pressure&#8208;triggered photoluminescence turn&#8208;on behavior can serve as a robust optical switchable logic gate from the initially dark state &#8220;0&#8221; to the bright state &#8220;1&#8221;. Furthermore, the pressure&#8208;treated (C25H22P)2SnCl6 exhibited an unexpected excitation&#8208;dependent emission.








Abstract

         <title>A Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces DNA Condensation in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleus&#8208;targeting RuC9, with its high charge, can induce intracellular DNA condensation, preventing DNA helicases, DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase, and transcription factors from binding to DNA. This ruthenium(II) complex hinders DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to the death of cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells.








Abstract
One of the conventional ways to eradicate tumor cells is to utilize chemotherapy agents, e.g., cisplatin, to induce DNA damage. However, DNA damage repair mechanisms can significantly limit the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. These mechanisms enable tumor cells to repair the DNA damage caused by the drug, leading to resistance. Cisplatin and similar drugs bind to specific DNA sites without significantly altering their conformation. As a result, DNA repair enzymes can still attach to and repair the damaged DNA. To address this issue, we designed four Ru(II) complexes (RuC3, RuC6, RuC9, and RuC12) with high positive charges of +8 valence and regulated their nuclear accumulation levels by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. RuC9 exhibits the highest nucleus accumulation level. DNA conformation was significantly altered by inducing DNA condensation through indiscriminately neutralizing the negative charge of the DNA backbone. This significant change prevents DNA&#8208;related enzymes from binding to DNA, ultimately leading to the efficient eradication of various tumor cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that kills tumor cells and overcomes cisplatin resistance through inducing DNA condensation.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Fast Li&#8208;Ion Channels in Ionic Plastic Crystal Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the structural design principles of ionic plastic crystals for solid&#8208;state electrolytes and prepared an ionic plastic crystal electrolyte with low self&#8208;mobility and high ionic conductivity. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with ionic plastic crystal electrolyte achieved stable cycling in a wide temperature range (0&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). 








Abstract
The practical use of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is hindered by the intractable electrolyte/electrode interfacial resistance and discontinuous ion transport networks within electrodes. Ionic plastic crystals offer a potential solution to these challenges due to their melt&#8208;permeable properties to the electrodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity restricts their application. Here, we propose a design principle for solid&#8208;state electrolytes based on an electric field&#8208;induced strategy by using ionic plastic crystals with low self&#8208;migrating and high conductivity toward target ions. Through the external potential difference, an ordered internal electric field is generated within the ionic plastic crystal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (IPCEs), which mitigates the coordination limitations of anions on target ions to facilitate rapid ion conduction. The prepared IPCE demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.08&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a Li+ transfer number (0.77), enabling the application of ASSBs over a wide temperature range (from 0 to 60&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the assembled Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 ASSBs exhibit stable cycling, maintaining 97.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a fresh perspective on the practical application of ASSBs, highlighting the potential of IPCEs in enhancing battery performance.

         <title>Controlled Catalysis Delivering High Molecular Weight Polyesters as Recyclable Alternatives to Polystyrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work exemplifies how to make high molar mass ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) polyesters as engineering plastics, informing upon their thermal and mechanical properties. Leading polyesters, prepared by epoxide/anhydride ROCOP, show high glass transition temperatures and tensile and flexural strengths, matching or exceeding polystyrene properties.








Abstract
An organometallic Al(III)K(I) catalyst shows exceptional control in the epoxide/anhydride ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP), producing high molecular weight polyesters (Mn &#8764; 100&#160;kg&#183;mol&#8722;1). The catalysis is highly effective using cyclohexene oxide, cyclopentane oxide, substituted cyclohexene oxide, and butylene oxide, each combined with phthalic anhydride. The polyesters show entanglement molecular weights, determined by oscillatory shear rheology, from 13 to 50&#160;kg&#183;mol&#8722;1 with cyclopentene and substituted cyclohexene moieties being particularly effective (highly entangled). The lead polyesters show high glass transition temperatures (94&#160;&#176;C&#160;&lt;&#160;Tg&#160;&lt;&#160;137&#160;&#176;C), high tensile strengths (40&#160;MPa&#160;&lt;&#160;&#963;&#160;&lt;&#160;47&#160;MPa) and tensile modulii (0.6&#160;GPa&#160;&lt;&#160;Ey&#160;&lt;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa); their properties are similar to polystyrene. The polyesters are all recyclable by repeated cycles of compression molding, and show equivalently high thermal&#8208;mechanical performances even over repeated recycles.

         <title>Isolable Three&#8208;Coordinate Base&#8208;Stabilized Alumylene: A Precursor of Persistent Acceptor&#8208;Free Monomeric Aluminum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric alumylene stabilized by two donor ligands (phosphine and NHC) has been successfully synthesized. This alumylene complex exhibits an enhanced nucleophilic character and a preserved ambiphilic reactivity compared to the monoligated complex. As a consequence, its oxidation by N2O proceeds even at &#8722;90 &#176;C, allowing the synthesis of an acceptor&#8208;free aluminum oxide persistent up to &#8722;70 &#176;C.








Abstract
An isolable monomeric alumylene 2 stabilized by two donating ligands (phosphine and NHC) has been synthesized. Experimental and theoretical analysis confirm that the NHC ligand in 2 is labile and reversibly dissociates from the AlI center above &#8722;20 &#176;C. Of particular interest, despite being thermodynamically stabilized by two donor ligands, alumylene complex 2 exhibits a high reactivity with a considerably higher nucleophilicity compared to the monophosphine&#8208;ligated complex 5. It is interesting to note that 2 reacts immediately with N2O at &#8722;90 &#176;C, allowing the synthesis of bis&#8208;ligated aluminum oxide 15, which is stable up to &#8722;70 &#176;C.

         <title>Modulating the Chromophores of Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with different chromophores were designed and synthesized, which exhibit efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 to HCOO&#8722;. Among which, MCOF&#8208;ANT with anthracene (ANT) group shows the highest HCOO&#8722; production rate of 1658&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, which is 7.2 and 2.1 times higher than those of MCOF&#8208;Ph and MCOF&#8208;Nap with phenyl (Ph) and naphthalene (Nap) groups, respectively.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert low&#8208;concentration CO2 into the value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is particularly interesting yet remains highly challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized three metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) through the Schiff&#8208;base condensation reactions between trinuclear copper complex and different BDP&#8208;based chromophores (BDP&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8722;. As a result, MCOF&#8208;ANT containing anthracene (ANT) groups achieves the highest HCOO&#8722; production rate of 1658&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (HCOO&#8722; selectivity, &#8764;100%) in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers under a laboratory light source, which is 7.2 and 2.1 times higher than those of MCOF&#8208;Ph and MCOF&#8208;Nap with phenyl (Ph) and naphthalene (Nap) groups, respectively. Furthermore, MCOF&#8208;ANT also exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8722; under natural sunlight, with a HCOO&#8722; production rate of 1239&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (HCOO&#8722; selectivity, &#8764;100%). Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the presence of ANT in MCOF&#8208;ANT is favorable to the visible&#8208;light harvesting and charge separation, as well as the formation of *OCO intermediate, which clearly accounts for its superior catalytic activity.

         <title>Reaction of Nitrate Radicals and DMPO in Non&#8208;Aqueous Media: A Novel Detection Tool to Highlight the Nitrate Radical Role in Photocatalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin trapping agent DMPO reacts with nitrate radicals in non&#8208;aqueous environment producing its oxidized adduct DMPOX. The peculiar EPR spectral features of DMPOX can be considered fingerprint of the presence of nitrate radicals. Results support in a more direct way the proposed generation and reactivity of nitrate radicals in heterogeneous photocatalysis.








Abstract
The reaction of DMPO as the spin trapping agent with nitrate radicals photocatalytically generated results in the formation of DMPOX showing a highly specific EPR spectrum. The method can be used as a semi&#8208;quantitative and convenient way to detect nitrate radicals in non&#8208;aqueous solutions/suspensions, which was never achieved up to now through EPR spectroscopy. Results support in a more direct way the proposed generation and reactivity of nitrate radicals in photocatalytic media and open a new chapter in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis.

A novel double boron&#8211;oxygen&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (dBON&#8208;PAH) emitter has been developed that shows ultraviolet emission with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) properties. A doped OLED exhibited a high color purity and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (&#955;EL&#160;=&#160;399&#160;nm, FWHM&#160;=&#160;37&#160;nm, CIEy&#160;=&#160;0.030, and EQEmax&#160;=&#160;18.6%), demonstrating a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for HLCT&#8208;based UV OLEDs with CIEy &lt;&#160;0.05.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;efficiency ultraviolet organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV OLEDs) remains challenging due to the need for efficient utilization of triplet excitons while maintaining a wide bandgap. In this study, we designed double boron&#8211;oxygen&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (dBON&#8208;PAHs) with rigid planar structures and developed a novel UV emitter, BO&#8208;N, featuring hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) properties. BO&#8208;N exhibited UV emission in toluene solution and 1,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene (mCP) film, with photoluminescence (PL) peaks of 391 and 400&#160;nm and narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 15 and 34&#160;nm, respectively. The device doped with 5 wt% BO&#8208;N achieved a narrowband UV emission with an FWHM of 37&#160;nm, an electroluminescence peak (&#955;EL) of 399&#160;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.166, 0.030). Moreover, the device attained a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 18.6% among reported HLCT&#8208;based UV OLEDs with CIEy &lt;&#160;0.05. These findings highlight the great potential of double BON&#8208;PAHs as robust emitters for high&#8208;performance UV OLEDs.

         <title>Expanding the Spectral Range in T2&#8208;Supertetrahedral Nonlinear Optical Chalcogenides via Incorporating Inorganic Polycations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>

The incorporation of the inorganic (Cl4K8Ba2)8+ salt cation instead of an organic ligand cation endowed [K4BaCl2][In6Se11] with a wide infrared transparency range (0.7&#8211;18.1&#160;&#181;m), which can be considered the finishing touch in advancing [K4BaCl2][In6Se11] as a viable IR NLO candidate.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;chalcogenide supertetrahedral clusters that exhibit significant hyperpolarizability are highly sought after as promising nonlinear optical (NLO) function modules. However, these &#8220;naked&#8221; anionic clusters are commonly coordinated with organic ligands to maintain electrical neutrality, which unfortunately limits their utility in the mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared (MFIR) region due to strong absorption. In this study, we successfully substituted the organic ligand with the unprecedented (X4K8Ba2)8+ supertetrahedral cations, which are suitable size and high charge, and integrated them with (In4Se10)8&#8722; supertetrahedral clusters to form 3D salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenides (SICs), [K4BaX2][In6Se11] (X&#160;=&#160;Cl 1,&#160;Br 2). As anticipated, the parallel arrangement of the (In4Se10)8&#8722; clusters yielded splendid second&#8208;harmonic generation intensities (2.2&#8211;2.4&#160;&#215;&#160;benchmark AgGaS2 @1910&#160;nm for 1 and 2, respectively), ranking among the top within the SICs category. Most importantly, the introduction of inorganic polycations with a broad cut&#8208;off IR edge is a key factor in enabling 1 to achieve an ultrawide transparency range (0.7 to 18.1&#160;&#181;m) that covers the crucial atmospheric windows (3&#8211;5 and 8&#8211;14&#160;&#181;m). Indeed, replacing the organic ligand with an inorganic polycation allows supertetrahedra&#8208;based chalcogenides to fulfill the broad&#8208;spectrum criteria of NLO materials.

         <title>Bright and Versatile Azetidinecarboxamide&#8208;Based Fluorophore&#8211;Ligand Conjugates for High&#8208;Resolution Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azetidinecarboxamide substitution enhances fluorophore brightness and provides an integrated reactive site for ligand conjugation. This dual&#8208;function design streamlines the synthesis of fluorophore&#8211;ligand conjugates, enabling rapid, efficient, and modular probe development for biological imaging.








Abstract
Fluorophore&#8211;ligand conjugates play a pivotal role in cellular imaging, providing high target specificity. However, simultaneously achieving conjugates with high brightness and ligand&#8208;targeting diversity presents significant challenges. Traditional strategies often require complex, multistep modifications for fluorophore enhancement and ligand conjugation. Here, we present an azetidinecarboxamide strategy that addresses these challenges by integrating brightness enhancement and ligand conjugation capabilities within a single molecular framework. The azetidinecarboxamide core suppresses twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thereby enhancing fluorescence quantum yield. Its carbonyl group provides a versatile site for conjugating a wide range of targeting ligands, enabling the rapid development of diverse and tunable fluorophore&#8211;ligand conjugates. This streamlined approach reduces synthetic complexity, accelerates probe development, and is compatible with a wide variety of fluorophores, such as coumarin, naphthalimide, NBD, rhodol, rhodamine, and silicon&#8211;rhodamine, facilitating the creation of high&#8208;performance, multifunctional probes for advanced cellular imaging.

         <title>Preparation of Thermally and Photochemically Immobilized N&#8208;type Conjugated Polymer Films via Quantitative Backbone Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A postpolymerization modification (PPM) of n&#8208;type conjugated polymers by nucleophilic aromatic substitution is reported, enabling precise tuning of solubility, ordering, and stability. The method allows the facile introduction of azide groups, which can undergo UV&#8208; or thermally induced crosslinking, to afford stable, insoluble films with retained electron transport in transistor devices.








Abstract
We report a series of n&#8208;type conjugated polymers based on PNDI&#8208;TfBTT and PNDIV&#8208;TfBTT backbones constructed from electron&#8208;deficient naphthalene diimide (NDI) and fluorinated benzothiadiazole (fBT) units, with PNDIV&#8208;TfBTT incorporating a vinylene spacer. Quantitative postpolymerization modification (PPM) via nucleophilic substitution replaced the fBT fluorine with thioether side chains, optionally containing azide groups. Thioether substitution improved solubility, while subtly changing the ordering of polymer films. Azide incorporation enabled both thermal and photochemical crosslinking, yielding insoluble and immobile films that retained good electron transport; although UV crosslinking initially reduced mobility, subsequent thermal annealing largely restored crystallinity and performance. This work underscores the utility of precise backbone editing to fine&#8208;tune the electronic and morphological properties of n&#8208;type polymers, offering new avenues for the fabrication of stable, patterned active layers in advanced organic electronic devices.

         <title>Hydrogenation of &#8220;Readily Activated Molecule&#8221; for Glycine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>

By recognizing the unique characteristics of the glyoxylate oxime intermediate, we introduce a brand&#8208;new concept of &#8220;readily activated molecule&#8221;, which empowers Ag as the ideal catalyst for glycine electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of glyoxylate oxime is the energy&#8208;intensive step in glycine electrosynthesis. To date, there has been a lack of rational guidance for catalyst design specific to this step, and the unique characteristics of the oxime molecule have often been overlooked. In this study, we initiate a theoretical framework to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of glycine electrosynthesis across typical transition metals. By comprehensively analyzing the competitive reactions, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes, and desorption steps, we identify the unique role of the glyoxylate oxime as a &#8220;readily activated molecule&#8221;. This inherent property positions Ag, featuring weak adsorption characteristics, as the &#8220;dream&#8221; catalyst for glycine electrosynthesis. Notably, a record&#8208;low onset potential of &#8722;0.09&#160;V versus RHE and an impressive glycine production rate of 1327&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 are achieved when using an ultralight Ag foam electrode. This process enables gram&#8208;scale glycine production within 20 h and can be widely adapted for synthesizing diverse amino acids. Our findings underscore the vital significance of considering the inherent characteristics of reaction intermediates in catalyst design.

         <title>A Ruthenium(II) Complex Inhibits BRD4 for Synergistic Seno&#8208; and Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>

A Ru(II) complex, Ru2c, was developed as a BRD4 inhibitor with a nanomolar binding constant. As the first Ru(II)&#8208;based BRD4 inhibitor, Ru2c achieved senotherapy and chemotherapy in cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells and was demonstrated to activate innate and acquired immunity in vivo.








Abstract
Drug resistance is a significant challenge for tumor therapy. Activating immunity is an effective method to combat drug&#8208;resistant tumors. Utilizing metallic chemotherapeutic agents to induce nonapoptotic programmed cell death is a practical approach to stimulate immunity. Besides, triggering tumor cell senescence, named senotherapy, is also an effective but often ignored method to induce immune responses. Despite some progress, reports on metallic immunotherapeutic stimuli are sparse and mainly delve into the level of organelle targeting, with vague drug&#8211;target mechanisms. Here, we report a Ru(II) complex (Ru2c) inhibits BRD4 with high affinity at a nanomolar constant. After encapsulation into biotin&#8208;DNA cage, Ru2c@biotin&#8208;DNA cage was demonstrated to kill drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells through a synergistic apoptosis&#8208;ferroptosis&#8208;senescence pathway, exhibiting 51&#8208;fold anticancer activity compared to the commercial inhibitor JQ&#8208;1. Ru2c effectively erased drug&#8208;resistant tumors and activated innate and acquired immunity in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, Ru2c is the first metal&#8208;based BRD4 inhibitor to achieve synergistic seno&#8208;immunotherapy and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;A Ru(II) complex, &lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt;, was developed as a BRD4 inhibitor with a nanomolar binding constant. As the first Ru(II)-based BRD4 inhibitor, &lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt; achieved senotherapy and chemotherapy in cisplatin-resistant tumor cells and was demonstrated to activate innate and acquired immunity in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug resistance is a significant challenge for tumor therapy. Activating immunity is an effective method to combat drug-resistant tumors. Utilizing metallic chemotherapeutic agents to induce nonapoptotic programmed cell death is a practical approach to stimulate immunity. Besides, triggering tumor cell senescence, named senotherapy, is also an effective but often ignored method to induce immune responses. Despite some progress, reports on metallic immunotherapeutic stimuli are sparse and mainly delve into the level of organelle targeting, with vague drug&#8211;target mechanisms. Here, we report a Ru(II) complex (&lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt;) inhibits BRD4 with high affinity at a nanomolar constant. After encapsulation into biotin-DNA cage, &lt;b&gt;Ru2c@biotin-DNA cage&lt;/b&gt; was demonstrated to kill drug-resistant cancer cells through a synergistic apoptosis-ferroptosis-senescence pathway, exhibiting 51-fold anticancer activity compared to the commercial inhibitor JQ-1. &lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt; effectively erased drug-resistant tumors and activated innate and acquired immunity in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, &lt;b&gt;Ru2c&lt;/b&gt; is the first metal-based BRD4 inhibitor to achieve synergistic seno-immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Dynamic Conjugated Oligomers Displaying Length&#8208;Dependent Configuration Metastability, State&#8208;Dependent Properties, and Helix Emergence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precision conjugated oligomer with alternating di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;arylsubstituted alkenes is designed and constructed via liquid&#8208;phase iterative synthesis, exhibiting a chain length&#8208;dependent conformation transition to induce helix assembly. The dynamic stereoisomeric system also shows distinct state&#8208;dependent responsiveness to light and thermal stimuli.








Abstract
The emergence of structure and function at the mesoscale is critical for the design of complex molecular materials. In this work, we report an iterative liquid&#8208;phase construction of precision conjugated oligomers with alternating di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;arylsubstituted alkene (DAA and TAA) building blocks. Due to the dynamically reversible isomerization of TAA building blocks in the backbone, this system exhibited a complex library of constitutional stereoisomers with configurational metastability, as characterized by HRMS, chiral HPLC, and 2D excitation&#8208;emission fluorescence mapping analysis. The dynamic oligomer system exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced absorption shifts and state&#8208;dependent fluorescence and shows constitutional responses to thermal and light stimuli. During the self&#8208;assembly process, mesoscale helicity emerges in the P5 oligomer and evolves into regular helices (40&#8211;66&#160;nm pitch) in the P9 oligomer, which can also be tuned by side group modulation. Experimental and computational studies suggest a dynamic transition of conjugated backbone conformations with increasing chain length from linear, rich in trans&#8208;alkenes, to twisted with alternating trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;alkenes, resulting in a stereoregular triangular chain segment for secondary structure generation and property emergence.

         <title>Fast and Autonomous Mannosylated Nanomotors for Dynamic Cancer Cell Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;loaded nanomotor decorated with mannose polymers shows a synergistic effect with respect to cell targeting. The mannose units interact with mannose receptors (MRs) on the cell surface, whereas the presence of the glycopolymer on the motor surface also leads to a more effective motile behavior in cell medium.








Abstract
An attractive strategy in cancer cell therapy is to employ motile nanoparticles that can actively search for their target. Herein, we introduce mannosylated compartmentalized cross&#8208;linked enzyme&#8208;driven nanomotors (c&#8208;CLEnM), which exhibit specific and efficient targeting of Hep G2 cells through elevated autonomous motion. In this design, we constructed biodegradable bowl&#8208;shaped stomatocytes encapsulating the enzymes glucose oxidase (GOx) and catalase (CAT) within their nanocavity. A subsequent enzyme crosslinking reaction was performed to guarantee their stability. Furthermore, the c&#8208;CLEnM were surface modified with a mannose&#8208;functional glycopolymer, enabling binding with receptors expressed on Hep G2 cells. Interestingly, the targeting ligands on the nanomotors not only improved their specificity toward cancer cells but also enhanced motility. Compared to the non&#8208;mannosylated nanomotors, mannosylated c&#8208;CLEnM exhibited enhanced motion and higher targeting efficiency to cells in glucose&#8208;containing ionic environments. The unexpected acceleration in speed resulted from the surface modification of these nanomotors with a glycopolymer layer, which increased the zeta potential and created a shielding effect that mitigated the influence of the surrounding ions. This nanomotor design highlights the synergistic effect of functional glycopolymer modification on cellular uptake, adding an additional level of control to nanomotors for application in cancer therapy.

         <title>Nonclassical Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Based Efficient Solid&#8208;State Organic Emitters Enabled by a Synergistic Anion and Mechanical Bond Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotaxane&#8208;based anion compounds demonstrate excellent photophysical properties that can be attributed to the synergistic effect of an anion and a mechanical bond. The universality of this synergistic effect has facilitated the exploration of novel applications, including the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) promoted by chiral anions and a fluorescence switchable rotaxane shuttle&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive material.








Abstract
Traditional fluorophores often face aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), limiting their efficacy in high&#8208;concentration applications. We demonstrate that a combined effect of anion and mechanical bond can significantly increase fluorescence intensity, up to 14&#8208;fold, and a quantum yield of 97.0%. A large number of crystal analyses reveal that this enhancement is primarily driven by nonclassical hydrogen bonds, which stabilize the structure and restrict molecular motion. The versatility of this synergistic effect opens up new avenues for applications, including circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) facilitated by chiral anions and the development of a fluorescence switchable rotaxane shuttle&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive material.

         <title>Tubular Nanostructures from Large&#8208;Pore 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavy mesoporous 2D covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized with a 6&#8208;nm hexagonal pore lattice. This COF forms non&#8208;covalent tubular domains that can be separated by mild sonication, yielding a family of tubular COF nanostructures that combine a 1D morphology with accessible mesopores.








Abstract
The synthesis of a wavy mesoporous 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with a 6&#8208;nm hexagonal pore lattice (Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1) is reported. This has been achieved by the synthesis of a terpyrenyl linker of approximately 2.7&#160;nm in length and its subsequent condensation with a 3&#8208;connected non&#8208;planar cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exists as non&#8208;covalent tubular domains composed of &#960;&#8208;stacked 4 to 5 pores in 2D COF sections that can be separated by mild sonication, resulting in a family of tubular COF nanostructures that combine a 1D morphology with accessible mesopores.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Heterometallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ Hybrid Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterotrimetallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ lantern&#8208;type cage has been synthesized in a single self&#8208;assembly step from a low&#8208;symmetry heterotopic ligand containing terminal groups with different metal coordination preferences, hybridizing the metallosupramolecular motifs of Cu4L4 and Pd2L4 cages.








Abstract
Traditional methods of assembling low&#8208;symmetry heterometallic cage architectures are limited to stepwise construction and combinations of inert and labile metal ions, affording complex, anisotropic cage structures by sacrificing synthetic ease. Herein, a heterometallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ lantern&#8208;type cage has been assembled in a single self&#8208;assembly step through the use of a heteroditopic ligand with two different metal&#8208;binding groups. The resultant cage complex is a fusion of two common lantern&#8208;type cage motifs&#8212;carboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic Cu4L4 cages and pyridyl&#8208;based Pd2L4 coordination cages. Evidence for heterometallic cage formation in solution was provided by 1H and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data, whereas circular dichroism (CD) spectra confirmed the helical nature of the assembly. The heterometallic cage was then exploited in binding heterotopic guests. It is envisioned that the simple design strategy presented herein will ease the assembly of other structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry cage architectures.

         <title>Engineering Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites in Ordered Macroporous Architectures for Enhanced C2H4 Production from CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was constructed by in situ creating Cu&#9472;In active sites within the three&#8208;dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) In2O3, which demonstrates a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating 3DOM architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically enhance C2H4 production in photocatalytic CO2 and H2O conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic C2H4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O by utilizing solar energy represents a promising sustainable process, yet its efficiency remains significantly limited. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically promote the photocatalytic C2H4 production. As an example, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was synthesized by in situ incorporating Cu single atoms (Cu SAs) into 3DOM In2O3 through a template&#8208;assisted pyrolysis process. The strong interaction between Cu SAs and In2O3 resulted in the formation of charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#9472;In active sites along with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs). 3DOM architectures serving as special nanoreactors displayed significant advantages in promoting CO2 enrichment and confining key intermediates, thereby increasing *CO coverage. Meanwhile, the charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#9472;In active sites effectively mitigated electrostatic repulsion and promoted the formation of *CO&#160;+&#160;*CHO intermediates, resulting in a thermodynamically spontaneous C&#9472;C coupling step. Therefore, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst exhibited robust CO2 reduction to C2H4, achieving high C2H4 evolution rates under various CO2 concentrations, including pure CO2, 10% CO2 in Ar (simulated flue gas), and 0.04% CO2 in Ar (simulated air). This work offers a novel strategy for the construction of photocatalysts with tailored microstructures and specific active sites to promote the conversion of CO2 and H2O into multicarbon products.

         <title>Electron Acceptors Based on Resonant N&#9472;B&#8592;N Unit with Improved Exciton Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of high&#8208;performance electron acceptors for short&#8208;wavelength infrared organic photodetectors (SWIR OPDs) has been demonstrated, following a strategy that is distinctly different from the general quinoidal and donor&#8211;acceptor strategies. The acceptor utilizes four thiophene&#8208;fused BODIPY units to achieve SWIR absorption, while pentafluorophenyl end groups enable efficient exciton dissociation.








Abstract
Device performance of photodiode&#8208;type short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) is largely limited by poor exciton dissociation. In this work, we reported that downshifted highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) and increased electrostatic potential (ESP) of electron acceptor lead to improved exciton dissociation and consequently enhanced SWIR OPD device performance. Tetramers of thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TF&#8208;BODIPY) unit represent a new kind of electron acceptors with SWIR photoresponse. By endcapping the TF&#8208;BODIPY tetramer with electron&#8208;deficient pentafluorophenyl groups, we downshift the EHOMO of the electron acceptor by 0.06&#160;eV and increase the ESP of the electron acceptor by 89&#160;meV. As a result, the OPD devices of the electron acceptor exhibit SWIR photoresponse in the wavelength range of 0.3&#8211;1.3&#160;&#181;m with a maximum specific detectivity (D*) of 1.04&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones and a responsivity (R) of 0.16 A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 1.12&#160;&#181;m. This performance is among the highest reported for SWIR OPDs.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allenylic Substitution via Kinetic Resolution Enabled by New Monodentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetic resolution of allenylic alcohols by asymmetric allenylic substitution has been achieved, which was enabled by the design of a new chiral ligand that altered the energetic profiles of the previously established pathways. Both secondary and tertiary alcohols were suitable substrates. Mechanism studies indicated that the reaction proceeds by an SN1 pathway.








Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic substitution represents a useful method for the construction of allenes bearing an allenylic central chirality, but current success has uniformly relied on only one specific chiral bidentate ligand. Herein, we address the limitation by the design of a new type of monodentate ligands leading to not only excellent enantiocontrol in allenylic substitution but also efficient kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;allenylic alcohols, a new phenomenon never observed before in iridium&#8208;catalyzed allenylic substitution. This is also a rare demonstration of the non&#8208;enzymatic kinetic resolution of &#945;&#8208;allenylic alcohols. A range of highly enantioenriched allenylic diarylmethanes and &#945;&#8208;allenylic alcohols could be accessed under mild conditions. Control experiments and DFT studies indicated that this process proceeds by an SN1 pathway featuring a rate&#8208;determining ionization step followed by ligand&#8208;controlled enantiodetermining nucleophilic addition. The newly designed rigid and bulky ligands modified from SPHENOL were believed to assemble the key iridium&#8208;bound allenylic carbocation intermediate in a different complexation mode, thus serving as the origin of enantiocontrol and the unprecedented kinetic resolution.

         <title>Geminiarene&#8208;Based Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystals with Dichromatic Variants and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Structural Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer cocrystal system has been developed that uses the dual conformations of geminiarene to achieve dichromatic stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. The system forms two color variants, enables solvent detection, and exhibits a loop&#8208;locked structural transition, thus offering a new strategy for responsive materials in sensing and adsorption applications.








Abstract
The construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals is a challenging frontier in organic crystal engineering. Here, we introduce a gemini CT cocrystal system with dichromatic stimuli&#8208;responsiveness by utilizing the unique dual/gemini conformational feature of geminiarene. Geminiarene binds with the electron&#8208;deficient guest 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene through exo&#8208;wall interactions to form two types of gemini CT cocrystals with distinct colors. Single&#8208;crystal structures, along with theoretical calculations and spectral analyses, reveal that the color differences are primarily due to the dual molecular conformations of geminiarene and their distinct electronic properties. Notably, the gemini CT cocrystal system can be used to develop a novel dichromatic sensing material capable of distinguishing commonly used organic solvents. Moreover, the stimuli&#8208;responsive interconversion between the two conformations of geminiarene enables a loop&#8208;locked structural transition in the cocrystal system. This work expands CT cocrystal engineering and offers a new strategy for designing intelligent responsive materials for sensing and adsorption applications.

Concise total syntheses of five leuconoxine alkaloids have been achieved using a pyrrole&#8208;centered strategy, which features a newly developed palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed pyrrole double C&#9472;H functionalization method, a divergent late&#8208;stage oxidative dearomatization tactic, and no use of protecting groups.








Abstract
Concise total syntheses of five leuconoxine&#8208;type alkaloids, i.e., chloromelodinine, leuconodine A, leuconodine F, melodinine E, and leuconoxine, are achieved through a pyrrole&#8208;centered strategy. The approach features a newly developed palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed pyrrole double C&#9472;H functionalization reaction to generate the core skeleton and a divergent oxidative dearomatization to complete the end game. In addition, no protecting group was employed, and the strategic use of a chloro substituent offers a number of advantages in these syntheses, which could have implications beyond this work. The discovery of an unusual chloro 1,2&#8208;migration reaction enabled the first total synthesis of chloromelodinine E. This work represents the shortest syntheses of these natural products to date with 10&#8211;11 total steps.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Dehydrofluorination of Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Binder on the Failure of Graphite Anode in Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrofluorination reaction of PVDF triggered by potassium ethoxide (EtOK) was deciphered in PIBs; the reaction not only corrodes the binder but also releases detrimental ethanol into the electrolyte. The released ethanol will dissolve the organic components of the SEI and result in a more serious electrolyte decomposition. The reaction is the key factor leading to the inferior Coulombic efficiency of graphite and the rapid failure of PVDF.








Abstract
The poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder has been successfully employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but it unexpectedly exhibits detrimental effects on the anode performance in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). The PVDF&#8208;based graphite electrode shows a low Coulombic efficiency and even fails to maintain the electrode integrity after several cycles in the 0.8&#160;M KPF6 ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate electrolyte. In this study, we unveil that the dehydrofluorination reaction of PVDF initiated by potassium ethoxide may be the key factor causing the above issues. The dehydrofluorination not only disables the binder but also releases detrimental ethanol into the electrolyte. The released ethanol can dissolve the organic components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and deplete the potassium resource, thereby resulting in a reduction of Coulombic efficiency and a more severe accumulation of SEI. The crowding of more accumulated SEI coupled with the large volume expansion of intercalated graphite results in the failure of PVDF&#8208;based graphite electrodes. This fundamental finding may provide a deeper insight into the failure mechanism of PVDF as a binder in PIBs, and meanwhile, give valuable guidance for the use of PVDF in battery communities containing sodium&#8208;ion batteries and LIBs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Carbonized Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Supported on Lignin&#8208;Functionalized Phenolic Resin for Potent Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Lignin&#8208;Derived Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;functionalized lignin&#8208;based phenolic resin with a nano&#8208;chain&#8208;like structure was produced via a non&#8208;carbonation strategy with lignin and NH3&#183;H2O. This structure provides abundant &#8208;NH2 groups, enabling N coordination with Pd sites. Such interactions stabilize the Pd sites and optimize their catalytic environment, enhancing aldehyde adsorption and significantly improving the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic transfer hydrogenation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) depend significantly on their support properties, and organic polymers have emerged as promising candidates due to their tunable physicochemical properties and diverse functional groups. However, the high&#8208;temperature carbonization commonly required for conventional organic polymer&#8208;supported SAC fabrication often leads to the loss of these functional groups, thus weakening metal&#8208;support interactions and catalytic performance accordingly. Herein, we report a sustainable strategy to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;functionalized lignin&#8208;based phenolic resin (N&#8208;LPR) supports for stabilizing atomically dispersed palladium (Pd) without carbonization. Using ammonia solution (NH3&#183;H2O) as both the nitrogen source and catalyst, high molecular weight lignin fractions (L3) were transformed into N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% supports with a unique nano&#8208;chain&#8208;like structure, high surface area, and abundant amine groups, which can directly anchor Pd sites under room temperature. The resulting Pd@N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% catalyst achieved approximately 100% vanillin conversion and 97.91% selectivity for 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol at 80&#160;&#176;C with excellent cycle stability and adaptability to lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes, benefiting from the stable Pd&#8208;N coordination and the good adsorption capacity provided by the N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% support. Consequently, this work not only demonstrates a straightforward non&#8208;carbonation strategy to prepare lignin&#8208;based SACs for potent biomass&#8208;derived chemical transformations but also provides a novel avenue for the application of conventional multifunctional organic polymers as support for SACs.

         <title>Antifreeze Protein Mimics Realizing Stable Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Water Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidized quasi&#8208;carbon nitride quantum dots (OQCNs), acting as mimics of antifreeze proteins, have been developed to regulate ice crystal formation and inhibit recrystallization. When incorporated into zinc&#8208;ion electrolytes, OQCNs effectively suppress ice growth in frozen electrolytes, thereby facilitating ion transpot. This regulation significantly enhances the low&#8208;temperature tolerance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries under high&#8208;moisture conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous metal batteries offer inherent safety and low cost due to the predominance of water in their aqueous electrolytes, yet their practical applications are severely limited by electrolyte freezing under subzero conditions. Drawing inspiration from the mechanism of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that protect living organisms from freezing damage, we synthesize oxidized quasi&#8208;carbon nitride quantum dots (OQCNs) featuring a regularly in&#8208;plane structure commensurate with the prism face of hexagonal ice crystal. At an ultralow concentration, the as&#8208;synthetic OQCNs effectively mimic AFP functionalities by controlling ice crystal morphology, suppressing ice growth kinetics, and inhibiting ice recrystallization. This synergistic mechanism preserves continuous ion transport pathways while mitigating physical damage to battery components caused by ice crystal growth. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the Gibbs&#8211;Thomson effect underpins the suppression of ice growth, avoiding complete solidification of the electrolyte under subzero conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Oxidized quasi-carbon nitride quantum dots (OQCNs), acting as mimics of antifreeze proteins, have been developed to regulate ice crystal formation and inhibit recrystallization. When incorporated into zinc-ion electrolytes, OQCNs effectively suppress ice growth in frozen electrolytes, thereby facilitating ion transpot. This regulation significantly enhances the low-temperature tolerance of aqueous zinc-ion batteries under high-moisture conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable aqueous metal batteries offer inherent safety and low cost due to the predominance of water in their aqueous electrolytes, yet their practical applications are severely limited by electrolyte freezing under subzero conditions. Drawing inspiration from the mechanism of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that protect living organisms from freezing damage, we synthesize oxidized quasi-carbon nitride quantum dots (OQCNs) featuring a regularly in-plane structure commensurate with the prism face of hexagonal ice crystal. At an ultralow concentration, the as-synthetic OQCNs effectively mimic AFP functionalities by controlling ice crystal morphology, suppressing ice growth kinetics, and inhibiting ice recrystallization. This synergistic mechanism preserves continuous ion transport pathways while mitigating physical damage to battery components caused by ice crystal growth. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the Gibbs&#8211;Thomson effect underpins the suppression of ice growth, avoiding complete solidification of the electrolyte under subzero conditions. The OQCNs-modified electrolyte exhibits exceptional cryogenic performance at &#8722;30 &#176;C, with Zn||Zn symmetric cell maintaining stable cycling of 1000 h and Zn||NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

This work unveils a bioinspired paradigm that significantly enhances the performance of eco-friendly, high-moisture electrolytes, paving the way for robust, low-temperature-resistant zinc-ion batteries and related aqueous electrolyte-based technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Equilibrium in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Supported Transition Metal Complexes: Selective Isolation of Multinuclear Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes containing bis(NHC) ligand were found to exist in a temperature&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent slow equilibrium between tri&#8208; and tetranuclear forms in solution. This was leveraged for the exclusive isolation of the tetranuclear species by dissolving the equilibrium through strong and stable H&#8208;bonding interactions. In contrast, the use of ClO4 as a guest, led to the exclusive formation of the guest encapsulated trinuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complex.








Abstract
The AgI&#8211;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes (3a,b) derived from bis(NHC) ligand 1, which exhibit a temperature&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium between the trinuclear and tetranuclear forms, has been successfully isolated, which is slow on NMR time scale. Intriguingly, by freezing this slow equilibrium, facilitated by strong and stable H&#8208;bonding, we could achieve selective isolation of the tetranuclear species (3a,b&#8208;II). On the other hand, encapsulation of an anionic guest, ClO4, led to exclusive formation of the guest encapsulated trinuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complex, 3a&#8208;I. This is unprecedented and marks the first instance where selective isolation of both the species involved in an equilibrium using a C&#8208;donor ligand could be attained. In contrast, distinct behavior was observed with the AuI ion, possessing the same linear geometry, however, with stronger M&#8211;CNHC bonds. In this context, a stable non&#8208;exchangeable&#160;&#8776;1:1 mixture (4a,b) of the tri&#8208; and tetranuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complexes were obtained via transmetalation of both equilibrating (3a,b) and the H&#8208;bonded tetranuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complexes (3a,b&#8208;II). Moreover, by aptly adjusting the reaction parameters of transmetalation process, the trinuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complex (4a,b&#8208;I) could indeed be obtained selectively. Overall, this study highlights a pioneering approach for the control of an equilibrium between different nuclearity metallo&#8208;supramolecular species engaging C&#8208;donor ligands.

         <title>Biomimetic Hierarchical Construction of Anti&#8208;Tumor Polyoxopalladates for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of lacunary polyoxopalladates resulted in a hierarchical assembly that resembles the construction of biomacromolecules. An ordered structural evolution from monomer via dimer to supramolecular aggregates was achieved by cooperative covalent and supramolecular bonding effects, resulting in enhanced anti&#8208;tumor activity via DNA damage.








Abstract
Inspired by the construction scheme of biomacromolecules, a hierarchical assembly based on the lacunary polyoxopalladate (POP) of [SrPd12O6(OH)3(PhAsO3)6(OAc)3]4&#8722; (SrPd12) has been achieved. As a structurally programmable molecular building block, SrPd12 is used to evolve from monomer via dimer to supramolecular aggregates in a controlled manner. In such process, the open&#8208;shell&#8208;type monomers are covalently integrated into bowl&#8208; or cage&#8208;like dimers via a direct or indirect splicing strategy. Upon that, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic effects are further hired to fabricate supramolecular aggregates of varied host&#8211;guest archetypes, thereby completing a hierarchical construction. In consideration of the combined advantages of noble metals and polyoxometalates in cancer treatment, both in vitro and in vivo&#160;anti&#8208;tumor assays of these SrPd12&#8208;derived POPs were studied in detail. A structure&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;tumor activitywas observed, originating from an imbalance of damage and repair of DNA as anti&#8208;tumor mechanism.

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Anthraquinones via J&#8208;Type Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 23, June 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces the torsional angle of anthraquinone compared to the nonacetylene control compound (1.81&#176; versus 33.4&#176;). This adjustment in torsional connectivity facilitates J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization in point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, presenting a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance CPL materials through the simultaneous optimization of emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency. 








Abstract
Circularly
polarized luminescence materials based on cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;chiral luminophores are highly desirable; however, their performance is often hindered by weak exciton&#8211;chirality coupling between the luminophore and its adjacent stereocenters. Here, we introduce J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization as an effective strategy to address this challenge. By attaching amide groups to point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, the formation of directional hydrogen bonds facilitates efficient chirality transfer from peripheral stereocenters to anthraquinones, resulting in supramolecular polymers with amplified chiroptical asymmetry. More importantly, the incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces torsional angle of the anthraquinone core compared to the nonacetylene control compound (1.81&#176; versus 33.4&#176;), promoting J&#8208;aggregation and increasing emission intensity. This structural optimization enables the supramolecular polymers to achieve a circularly polarized luminescence brightness of 13.8 M&#8315;&#185;cm&#8315;&#185;, marking a significant advancement in point&#8208;chiral luminophore systems. Furthermore, the integration of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into these supramolecular polymers allows for the fabrication of color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized electroluminescent devices. Overall, J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization represents a promising approach for developing high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials by simultaneously optimizing emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency.

         <title>Energetics Modulation for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operational stability of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under heat, air and humidity have notably improved over recent years. Yet, performance degradation under light and voltage bias remains a concern for their commercial deployment. One of the main causes of such degradation relates to mobile ions in the perovskite film, which can trigger ion migration and self&#8208;accelerating chemical degradation. Here, we propose an energetics modulation strategy by developing the electron&#8208;withdrawing Pyridinecarboxaldehyde oxime (PO) ligand for FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The introduction of PO ligands increases the ionization potential of the perovskite, inhibiting the generation of mobile ions during the crystallization process and subsequent device operation. Furthermore, this additive promotes the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts, which can help to regulate the energy level of perovskite and facilitate charge transport to the contact stacks. As a result, the optimized n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs exhibit a high efficiency of 26.13% and maintain over 88% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 h maximum power point (MPP) tracking test under one sun illumination. This work underlines the importance of energetics modulation for inhibiting intrinsic perovskite degradation that cannot be achieved by mere device encapsulation.</dc:description>

The introduction of PO ligands increases the ionization potential of the perovskite, inhibiting the generation of mobile ions during the crystallization process and subsequent device operation. Furthermore, this additive promotes the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts, which can help to regulate the energy level of perovskite and facilitate charge transport to the contact stacks. As a result, the optimized n-i-p PSCs exhibit a high efficiency of 26.13% and maintain over 88% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 h maximum power point (MPP) tracking test under one sun illumination. This work underlines the importance of energetics modulation for inhibiting intrinsic perovskite degradation that cannot be achieved by mere device encapsulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Lithium Metal in Cubic Wulff Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrodeposition of lithium (Li) metal is a crucial process for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable Li batteries. The morphology of Li deposits during electrodeposition governs the reversibility of the deposition/dissolution reaction, thereby significantly affecting the performance and safety of Li metal batteries. Various morphologies, including hemispherical, granular, columnar and whisker&#8208;like structures have been realized by modulating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the deposition process. However, the intrinsic Li deposition structure matching the body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) structure remains unexplored. In this work, we first successfully achieved precise control over cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating the anodic interface and optimizing the deposition pressure, while demonstrated kinetic&#8208;driven morphology evolution and substrate&#8208;engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. These findings integrate the thermodynamic theory of crystal growth with interface engineering, not only completing the missing piece in the cubic Wulff construction of Li metal but also providing a new paradigm for controlling the morphology of metal electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>NPA6: A Molecule for Non&#8208;Covalently Linked Radical&#8208;Enhanced ISC and High&#8208;Performance Photopolymerization with Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To harness electron spin exchange for radical&#8208;enhanced inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC), a typical strategy involves covalently attaching stable radicals to chromophores. Here, we introduce NPA6, synthesized by attaching heptanamide to N,N&#8208;diphenylnaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;amine (NPA). NPA6 maintains the phosphorescent properties of NPA and exhibits unique photo&#8208;generated radical behavior that is absent in NPA. These radicals can further adsorb neutral molecules to form supramolecular assemblies. Compared to pristine NPA6, these assemblies exhibit nearly complete NMR proton signal suppression in the aromatic region, enhanced absorption near 400 nm, and reduced fluorescence intensity. Phosphorescence measurements at 77K reveal stronger phosphorescence in the assemblies, with delayed excitation spectra confirming phosphorescence originating exclusively from neutral molecules, indicating successful non&#8208;covalent radical&#8208;enhanced ISC. As a photosensitizer in N,N&#8208;Dimethylacrylamide polymerization, NPA6 achieves nearly 100% conversion at 100 ppm under 410nm light and ambient conditions, exhibiting superior polymerization performance. Additionally, its afterglow makes it suitable as an in&#8208;situ quality indicator for transparent coatings, suggesting its potential applications in photolithography.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanoactivated Celite as a catalyst for C&#8210;H bond perfluoroalkylation and other radical reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report that Celite (diatomaceous earth) commonly viewed as an innocent filter aid or support material, or Earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic metal oxides are efficient mechanoactivated catalysts for arene and heteroarene C&#8210;H bond radical trifluoromethylation and pentafluoroethylation, with the activity comparable with previously reported mechanochemical methods utilizing piezoelectric materials. Celite was also applied for mechanochemical dibromination of a double bond with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, eliminating the need to use of lithium titanate as a piezoelectric mechanoredox catalyst. Mechanoactivation via ball milling in the presence of minimal amount of solvent was crucial to observe the reactivity, while sonication or using a pre&#8208;ground suspension in a bulk solvent were not efficient. The EDX studies and comparison with individual metal oxides suggest a possible role of trace metal oxides in mechanoinduced reactivity. Celite could be recycled and reused several times without significant loss activity. This approach offers environmentally benign, biocompatible and inexpensive Nature&#8208;inspired materials as efficient mechanocatalyts and conceptually broadens the scope of mechanoactivated solids to the materials previously deemed inert.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Alterations of Protein Polyubiquitination Revealed by Mass&#8208;Spectrometric Ubiquitome Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules which alter protein ubiquitination are emerging as therapeutics due to their ability to modulate targets previously deemed undruggable. These compounds comprise PROTACs, molecular glue degraders and DUB inhibitors, among others. However, methods for the proteome&#8208;wide monitoring of compound&#8208;induced changes in protein polyubiquitination, which may also detect non&#8208;degradative modifications, are lacking. Here, we report the utilization of polyubiquitin enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry to monitor small molecule&#8208;induced changes in cellular protein ubiquitination. We established enrichment through tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs) following semi&#8208;denaturing cell lysis and devised an elution protocol compatible with downstream LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. We demonstrate broad applicability of the workflow by assessing ubiquitination changes induced by a PROTAC, a p97 inhibitor and deubiquitinase inhibitors. Application of the assay to compounds inhibiting the deubiquitinase USP7 revealed the induction of non&#8208;degradative ubiquitination on the UBE3A E3 ligase. Collectively, we established a versatile proteomics method to facilitate the direct investigation of cellular polyubiquitination, with high relevance for the identification and characterization of protein degraders, stabilizers and other molecules with ubiquitin&#8208;mediated bioactivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electric vehicles and electric aircraft demand all&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, the interaction mechanism between charge transfer in solvation sheath and interfacial evolution is not yet clear. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#8221; strategy by introducing an amide polymer encapsulation matrix (APEM) to construct local charge&#8208;transfer channels to solvents for tuning the negative charge center. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron X&#8208;ray tomography reveal that the APEM drags out the polar solvent and promotes cation&#8208;anion coordination in the primary solvation sheath, contributing to AGGs&#8208;dominated interfacial solvation chemistry. The designed electrolyte improves the cyclability of Li|LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 up to 300 cycles at 4.6 V and high&#8208;temperature capability at 80 &#176;C. Even at &#8208;40 &#176;C, it still delivers a high capacity of 87.9 mAh g&#8722;1 with negligible capacity decay for 160 cycles. Industrial 3Ah&#8208;level pouch cells over 490 Wh kg&#8208;1 exhibit 91.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles, manifesting high potential in extreme applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Allene C&#8208;H Functionalization via Carbanion Sampling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds represents a direct and practical avenue to upgrade simple organic molecules to value&#8208;added products, whereas the reaction selectivity is largely governed by the acidity and bond dissociation energy (BDE) of C&#8208;H bonds. Developing a novel strategy to break these constrains is highly desirable, as it would open a new horizon for conventionally challenging molecules. Herein, we disclosed a carbanion sampling strategy that enables unconventional selectivity in the allene C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization harnessing chromium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen evolution. The electrochemical protocol provides in&#8208;situ access to diverse allene carbanions and facilitates a dynamic carbanion sampling process to give thermodynamic&#8208;unfavored products. 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted allenes were precisely functionalized at the less acidic and stronger C(sp2)&#8208;H site to yield abnormal site&#8208;selective allene products, while the 1,1&#8208;subitituted allenes proceeded isomerization to deliver functionalized alkynes. All of the products presented in this work are unprecedented and exhibit remarkable versatility in late&#8208;stage derivatization. The superiority of the carbanion sampling strategy was demonstrated in the convergent synthesis of functionalized allenes from alkyne or mixed substrates. More importantly, we conducted a series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments to rationalize the unconventional selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Rigid Exterior, Soft Interior&#8221;&#160;Design Enables High&#8208;Voltage Polyether Electrolytes for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State&#160;Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Polyether electrolytes&#160;with high Li+&#160;conductivity and excellent interfacial contact&#160;have garnered significant attention. Yet further applications of such electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries&#160;are severely hindered by the instability of the electrolyte and electrolyte/electrodes interphases. Here, we report a novel high&#8208;voltage&#160;polyether electrolyte&#160;with a &#8220;rigid exterior, soft interior&#8221; design, which involves a&#160;3D F&#8208;contained network as rigid exterior framework, and a unique solvation structure with intensified Li+&#8208;anion coordination as soft interior within the framework. The&#160;achieved&#160;electrolyte&#160;demonstrates an ionic conductivity of 1.13 mS/cm at 25 &#176;C, a Li+&#160;transference number of 0.85,&#160;and an extending electrochemical stability&#160;window of over 5 V. Besides, such designed polyether&#160;electrolyte further induces salt&#8208;philic, solvent&#8208;phobic interfacial films&#160;for stabilizing electrolyte/electrode&#160;interphases.&#160;An exceptional cyclability in a Li||Li cell for over 4000 hours,&#160;and a preferable capacity and cyclability in&#160;even&#160;4.6&#160;V Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;(NCM811) quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;(QSSBs) are demonstrated. Meanwhile, the resulting&#160;4.3&#160;V Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2&#160;QSSB&#160;shows a Coulombic efficiency of ~100% and an extremely high capacity retention of 95.4% after 600 cycles at 3C. A&#160;capacity retention of over 96.3% after 400 cycles at 1C are further realized in 4.5&#160;V Li||NCM811&#160;QSSB.</dc:description>

         <title>NbGa2S4(S2): A Rare Linear [S2]2&#8208; Coordination to Niobium Resulting in Simultaneously Large SHG Effect and Giant Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel niobium thiogallate, NbGa2S4(S2), featuring a rare linear [S2]2&#8208; coordination to niobium, which simultaneously exhibits a strong second harmonic generation effect (1.5 &#205; benchmark AgGaS2 (AGS)), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (5.7 &#205; AGS), and a giant birefringence (0.29 at 2 um, the largest among all reported 3D chalcogenides). Theoretical studies reveal that the polarizability anisotropy and hyperpolarizability are significantly enhanced due to the unique alignment of [S2]2&#8208; dimer within the crystal lattice. Additionally, the compound demonstrates exceptional chemical bond flexibility, which leads to significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion, one order of magnitude smaller than that of the benchmark AGS. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation functional materials with tailored optical and thermal characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Polarization&#8208;Driven Defect Engineering in Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) Cathode: Fast Charging and Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode material faces the challenge of coordinating the improvement of high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This study proposes an ion polarization&#8208;driven defect engineering strategy, which regulates the electronic structure and Na+ transmission dynamics of NFPP through Bi3+ doping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that Bi3+ with (18+2) electron configuration significantly enhances the crystal structure stability of NFPP by strengthening the covalency of Bi&#8208;O bonds. Meanwhile, the heterovalent Bi3+ doping optimizes the bandgap of the material (from 3.29 eV to 0.16 eV) and promotes Na+ diffusion, while introducing lattice defects to provide additional sodium storage sites. The optimized 0.02Bi&#8208;NFPP cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as the half&#8208;cell only takes 31.6 minutes to charge to 80% at a rate of 1 C, and the capacity decay is only 0.000495 mA h g&#8208;1 per cycle (86.9% capacity retention) over 20,000 cycles at 20 C. The full battery based on hard carbon anode maintains 95.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C. This study reveals the synergistic mechanism between ion polarization effect and lattice defects, and provides a new strategy for designing SIBs cathode materials with both fast charging/discharging capabilities and ultra&#8208;long life.</dc:description>

         <title>Bone&#8208;Inspired&#160;Sustainable Hydrogel Electrolytes for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are promising electrolytes for use in aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs). However, the problems associated with the Zn anodes cannot be eliminated using current hydrogel electrolytes, and their poor sustainability has also been neglected. We have developed a bone&#8208;inspired hydrogel electrolyte (Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel) composed of Zn&#8208;doped hydroxyapatite (Zn&#8208;HA) nanofibers and a gelatin matrix derived from animal bones. The bone&#8208;like structure and strong molecular interactions in the biodegradable, recyclable, and biocompatible components endow Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel with excellent sustainability, water retention, and mechanical properties, which solves the problems currently associated with Zn anodes. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;HA superionic conductor exhibits an ultrahigh intrinsic ionic conductivity and accelerated Zn2+ desolvation process. The dual&#8208;channels for Zn2+ transport in Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel result in high ionic conductivity (32.5 mS cm&#8208;1) and transference number (0.80), facilitating uniform Zn plating/stripping and durable working stability. As a result, Zn&#8208;HA&#8208;Gel ensures ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance with a cumulative capacity of 5 Ah cm&#8208;2 at 5 mA cm&#8208;2/5 mAh cm&#8208;2 for Zn/Zn cells, and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 82.4% after 2000 cycles for full cells, surpassing the capabilities of current hydrogel electrolytes, and has potential applications in sustainable and functional energy&#8208;storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Chirality Inversion in Propeller&#8208;Shaped PDI Oligomers with Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has the potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications. One of the major challenges in this field is the development of CPL emitters whose emission properties can be modulated by external stimuli, such as solvents. However, CPL&#8208;active materials are often synthetically demanding and typically require chiral separation. To address these limitations, we have synthesized a propeller&#8208;shaped molecule, (R/S)&#8208;Bz&#8208;6PDI 1, via a one&#8208;pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, using a chiral pyrrole&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) 4 as the blade. The introduction of a chiral auxiliary into the blade enabled the induction of propeller chirality without the need for chiral chromatographic separation. (R)&#8208;Bz&#8208;6PDI 1 exhibited high CPL brightness in solution (BCPL = 103&#8211;369 M&#8211;1cm&#8211;1). Furthermore, the propeller chirality proved highly sensitive to the solvent environment, leading to significant modulation of both the sign and intensity of the CD and CPL signals, including complete signal inversion in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. CD spectral analysis combined with DFT calculations revealed that the propeller chirality is governed by the orientation of the hydrogen atom in the chiral auxiliary.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoexcited Hole&#8208;Enabled Synthesis of Surface High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Oxo Species with Water as the Oxygen Atom Source for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo species (CoIV=O) are key intermediates in catalytic chemistry but suffer a great challenge in their efficient and mild synthesis due to the strong electronic repulsion between the cobalt center and the oxygen ligand. Herein, we report a new approach to synthesizing surface CoIV=O on the Co3O4/BiVO4 (CoBi) catalyst via a photoexcited hole&#8208;induced process using water as the oxygen atom source. The interfacial Co2+&#8208;O&#8208;Bi3+ bonds act as the atomic&#8208;level channels to directionally transport photoexcited holes driven by the internal electric field effect. It has been found that H2O was photolyzed to cobalt&#8208;coordinated hydroxyls that were turned to CoIV=O via a photoexcited hole&#8208;induced deprotonation. The isotopic labeling experiments confirmed that the oxygen atom source of CoIV=O was derived from water rather than chlorite. A synergistic effect was formed between photocatalysis and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed chlorite activation, which enhanced the degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and elevated the conversion ratio of chlorite to ClO2 from 40% to 60%. The present work has elucidated the essential role of H2O and photoexcited holes in the formation of CoIV=O and provides a viable strategy to synthesize surface high&#8208;valent metal species utilizing ubiquitous water and sunlight for water purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Bond Covalency in Superionic Halide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising superionic conductors with high oxidative stability and ionic conductivity, making them attractive for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, most studies have focused on ion&#8208;stacking structures, overlooking the role of bond characteristics in ionic transport. Here, we investigate bond dynamics and the superionic transition (SIT) in bromide electrolyte, Li3InBr6, using synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We demonstrate that the SIT in halide SSEs is driven by a thermally induced transition in bonding character (ionic to covalent) rather than a change in crystal phase. AIMD simulations further reveal enhanced Li&#8314; diffusion and collective anion motion at elevated temperatures. Expanding our study to Li3LnBr6 (Ln = Gd, Tb, Ho, Tm, Lu), we confirm the widespread occurrence of SIT in this material class, with Li3GdBr6 exhibiting the highest ionic conductivity (5.2 mS cm&#8208;1 at 298 K). More importantly, the ionic&#8208;covalent transition is highly tunable through electrolyte modifications, such as cation/anion substitution and synthesis methods. Our findings provide a new perspective on ionic transport, highlighting the critical role of chemical bond characteristics in halide SSEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissected MACl Involved Reaction Pathway for Low Temperature Fabrication of High&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are highly promising due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the formation of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 requires annealing at temperature of at least 150 &#176;C, which can induce significant residual stress and make the process incompatible with plastic substrates, resulting in poor crystal quality and compromised mechanical properties. To address these issues, we present a novel approach using methylammonium chloride (MACl) vapor&#8208;assistance of lead iodide (PbI2) to form homogeneous intermediate phases (MAPbCl3 and Pb3I8). This method optimizes the reaction pathway, accordingly pure &#945;&#8208;phase perovskite can be completely formed at 100 &#176;C, contrasting with conventional MACl component engineering in organic amine salt solution. We have intensively deciphered the reaction pathway leading to intermediate phases formation, as well as the nucleation and phase transition processes into the photoactive perovskite at 100 &#176;C. Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive study on temperature&#8208;dependent residual stress and cations reaction competition, meanwhile extensively dissected the competitive implication of interface mismatch and lattice defects leading to residual stress and cations component inhomogeneity. Consequently, the modified flexible&#8208;PVSCs have achieved a remarkable efficiency of 24.46% (25.50% for rigid PVSCs). The devices also exhibit significantly improved long&#8208;term and mechanical stability.</dc:description>
