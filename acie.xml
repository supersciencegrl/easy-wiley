         <title>Redoxdivergent Construction of (Dihydro)thiophenes with DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiophene&#8208;based rings are one of the most widely used building blocks for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Inspired by the redox diversity of nature&#8217;s feature, we demonstrate herein a redoxdivergent construction of dihydrothiophenes, thiophenes and bromothiophenes respectively from readily available allylic alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and HBr. The redoxdivergent selectivity could be manipulated mainly through controlling the dosage of DMSO and HBr. Mechanistic studies suggest that DMSO simultaneously acts as an oxidant and a sulfur donor. The synthetic potentials of the products as platform molecules have also been demonstrated by various derivatizations, including the preparation of bioactive and functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscale interfacial polymerization on a chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are powerful materials for inclusion in microfluidic devices. Forming hydrogels with precise geometries is however challenging and mostly done using photopolymerization, which involves toxic chemicals, rinsing steps, solvents and a bulky optical equipment. Here, we introduce a new method for in situ formation of hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined geometry in a sealed microfluidic chip by interfacial polymerization. The geometry of the hydrogel is programmed by microfluidic design using capillary pinning structures and bringing into contact solutions containing hydrogel precursors from vicinal channels. The characteristics of the hydrogel (mesh size, molecular weight cut&#8208;off) can be readily adjusted. This method is compatible with capillary&#8208;driven microfluidics, fast, uses small volumes of reagents and samples, and does not require specific laboratory equipment. Our approach therefore creates new opportunities for filtration, hydrogel functionalization, and hydrogel&#8208;based assays, as exemplified by a rapid and compact competitive immunoassay that does not require a rinsing step.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole hemithioindigo antimitotics with near&#8208;quantitative&#160;bidirectional photoswitching photocontrol cellular microtubule dynamics with single&#8208;cell precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchably bioactive reagents promise powerful applications to high&#8208;precision biological research. Yet, as most photoswitch scaffolds cannot be quantitatively bidirectionally photoisomerised, they suffer from residual background activity that can confound experiments. We report the first cellular application of the emerging near&#8208;quantitative photoswitch pyrrole hemithioindigo, by rationally designing photopharmaceutical "  PHTub  " inhibitors of the cytoskeletal protein tubulin.  PHTubs  allow simultaneous visible&#8208;light imaging and photoswitching in live cells, delivering cell&#8208;precise photomodulation of microtubule dynamics, and photocontrol over cell cycle progression and cell death. This is the first acute use of a hemithioindigo photopharmaceutical for high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution biological control in live cells. It additionally demonstrates the utility of near&#8208;quantitative photoswitches, by enabling a dark&#8208;active design to overcome residual background activity during cellular photopatterning. This work opens up new horizons for high&#8208;precision microtubule research using  PHTubs  ; and shows the cellular applicability of pyrrole hemithioindigo as a valuable scaffold for photocontrol of a range of other biological targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Li2MTeO6 (M=Ti, Sn): Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Wide Transparency Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide crystals have been widely used in the nonlinear optical (NLO) field in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible and near&#8208;infrared region. Most of the traditional oxide crystals are restricted in the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their narrow transmission window. Hence, attempting to extend infrared cutoff wavelength of oxide has attracted much attention. In our work, we reported two new tellurate Li  2  TiTeO  6  (LTT) and Li  2  SnTeO  6 &#173;  (LST) with broad transparent region 0.38&#8208;6.72 and 0.38&#8208;6.86 &#956;m, respectively, which could be excellent candidates for the mid&#8208;infrared NLO application. Both LTT and LST are crystallized in the orthorhombic space group  P  nn  2. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder second&#8208;order generation efficiency (26&#215;KDP) under the fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. The first&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder second&#8208;harmonic generations based on the crystal structures. Our results provide a novel oxide NLO crystal with a strong SHG and wide transparency range. It also paves a way to design new oxide mid&#8208;IR NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;NHC Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 2&#8208;Quinolones to Chiral 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds to generate chiral three&#8208;dimensional motifs is one of the most straightforward and important approaches in synthetic chemistry. We realized the Ru(II)&#8208;NHC catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild reaction conditions. Alkyl, aryl and halogen substituted optically active dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones were obtained in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The reaction provides an efficient and atom economic pathway to construct simple chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones. The desired products could be further reduced to tetrahydroquinolines and octahydroquinolones.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade in an Ultrastable Mesoporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the first example that using mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) as the protecting scaffold to organize the biocatalytic cascade. The confined microenvironment of MHOFs has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient transport of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates. This new MHOF&#8208;confined cascades system shows superior activity, extended scope of catalytic substrate and ultrahigh stability  that enables to operate complex chemical transformations  in a porous carrier. In addition, the advantages of MHOFs&#8208;confined cascades system for point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensing are also demonstrated. This study highlights the advantages of HOFs as scaffold of multiple enzymes assemblies, which has huge potential to mimic complex cellular transformations networks in a controllable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Record&#8208;High Electroluminescence Efficiency of 31.5% for Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) hold an advantage of high exciton utilization in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, robust TADF materials with emission peaks over 600 nm are still insufficient due to strong non&#8208;radiative decay according to energy&#8208;gap law.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purely organic molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) hold an advantage of high exciton utilization in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, robust TADF materials with emission peaks over 600 nm are still insufficient due to strong non-radiative decay according to energy-gap law. Herein, tailor-made red TADF molecules comprised of an electron-withdrawing pyrazino[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthroline-2,3-dicarbonitrile core and various electron-donating triarylamines are developed. These molecules can form intramolecular hydrogen-bonding, which is conducive to improving emission efficiency and promoting horizontal orientation by increasing molecular rigidity and planarity.

Abstract
Efficient organic emitters in the deep&#8208;red region are rare due to the &#8220;energy gap law&#8221;. Herein, multiple boron (B)&#8208; and nitrogen (N)&#8208;atoms embedded polycyclic heteroaromatics featuring hybridized &#960;&#8208;bonding/ non&#8208;bonding molecular orbitals are constructed, providing a way to overcome the above luminescent boundary. The introduction of B&#8208;phenyl&#8208;B and N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N structures enhances the electronic coupling of those para&#8208;positioned atoms, forming restricted &#960;&#8208;bonds on the phenyl&#8208;core for delocalized excited states and thus a narrow energy gap. The mutually ortho&#8208;positioned B&#8208; and N&#8208;atoms also induce a multi&#8208;resonance effect on the peripheral skeleton for the non&#8208;bonding orbitals, creating shallow potential energy surfaces to eliminate the high&#8208;frequency vibrational quenching. The corresponding deep&#8208;red emitters with peaks at 662 and 692&#8197;nm exhibit narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums of 38&#8197;nm, high radiative decay rates of ca. 108&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#8776;100&#8201;% photo&#8208;luminescence quantum yields and record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiencies of ca. 28&#8201;% in a normal planar organic light&#8208;emitting diode structure, simultaneously.

         <title>Twofold C&#8722;H Activation&#8208;Based Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8722;H Arylation Using Diarylacetylenes as Rare Arylating Reagents</title>

Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of phosphinamides and diarylacetylenes has been realized for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral biaryls bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center. The reaction proceeded via twofold C&#8722;H bond activation, with the alkynes being an arylating reagent.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond activation has been established as an attractive strategy to access axially chiral biaryls, and the most straightforward method is direct C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. However, the arylating source has been limited to several classes of reactive and bulky reagents. Reported herein is rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of diarylphosphinic amides and diarylacetylenes for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of biaryls with both central and axial chirality. This twofold C&#8722;H activation reaction stays contrast to the previously explored Miura&#8211;Satoh type 1:2 coupling of arenes and alkynes in terms of chemoselectivity and proceeded under mild conditions with the alkyne acting as a rare arylating reagent. Both C&#8722;H activation events are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control, with the 2nd C&#8722;H activation being diastereo&#8208;determining in a remote fashion. Analysis of the stereochemistry of the major and side products suggests moderate enantioselectivity of the initial C&#8722;H activation&#8211;desymmetrization process. However, the minor (R) rhodium vinyl intermediate is consumed more readily in undesired protonolysis, eventually resulting in high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the major product.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillating Actuators with Phototactic Locomotion Based on Black Phosphorus Heterostructure</title>

A new type of photoactuator based on a heterostructured black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid presents high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven reversible actuation. By using the BP&#8208;based actuator as the working unit, together with the self&#8208;oscillating configuration and asymmetric structure design, an inchworm&#8208;like soft actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed.







Abstract
Developing self&#8208;oscillating soft actuators that enable autonomous, continuous, and directional locomotion is significant in biomimetic soft robotics fields, but remains great challenging. Here, an untethered soft photoactuators based on covalently&#8208;bridged black phosphorus&#8208;carbon nanotubes heterostructure with self&#8208;oscillation and phototactic locomotion under constant light irradiation is designed. Owing to the good photothermal effect of black phosphorus heterostructure and thermal deformation of the actuator components, the new actuator assembled by heterostructured black phosphorus, polymer and paper produces light&#8208;driven reversible deformation with fast and large response. By using this actuator as mechanical power and designing a robot configuration with self&#8208;feedback loop to generate self&#8208;oscillation, an inchworm&#8208;like actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed. Moreover, due to the anisotropy and tailorability of the actuator, an artificial crab robot that can simulate the sideways locomotion of crabs and simultaneously change color under light irradiation is also realized.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Regulated Electron Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Enhanced Reactivity in Fe4S4&#8208;Mediated Redox Reaction of the Dph2 Enzyme During the Biosynthesis of Diphthamide</title>

We uncovered that the spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer and exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity are involved in Fe4S4&#8208;mediated reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond in Dph2, and that the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block may act as the redox site to mediate the electron donation and reception during the redox catalysis.







Abstract
The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;dependent radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8211;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe&#8208;4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low&#8208;energy and a high&#8208;energy groups, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the driving force of Fe4&#8722;C(&#947;) bonding, the net spin on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the opposite spin electron from the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer results in the exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity in the lower&#8208;energy group compared with those in the higher&#8208;energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in RS enzymes.

&lt;p&gt;The [4Fe-4S]-dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8211;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state-dependent reactivity of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state-dependent reactivity of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;(&#947;)&lt;/sub&gt; bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe-4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low-energy and a high-energy groups, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the driving force of Fe4&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;(&#947;)&lt;/sub&gt; bonding, the net spin on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the opposite spin electron from the Fe1-Fe2-Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin-regulated electron transfer results in the exchange-enhanced reactivity in the lower-energy group compared with those in the higher-energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe-4S] cluster in RS enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural Changes during the Growth of Atomically Precise Metal Oxido Nanoclusters from Combined Pair Distribution Function and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering Analysis</title>

The development of tools for combined, automated analysis of pair distribution function (PDF) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data enabled the identification of intermediate species in the formation of atomically precise [Bi38O45] nanoclusters (see picture). By studying cluster&#8211;solvent interactions it was also found that the solvent can affect the metal oxido structure.







Abstract
The combination of in situ pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) enables analysis of the formation mechanism of metal oxido nanoclusters and cluster&#8211;solvent interactions as they take place. Herein, we demonstrate the method for the formation of clusters with a [Bi38O45] core. Upon dissolution of crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O in DMSO, an intermediate rapidly forms, which slowly grows to stable [Bi38O45] clusters. To identify the intermediate, we developed an automated modeling method, where smaller [BixOy] structures based on the [Bi38O45] framework are tested against the data. [Bi22O26] was identified as the main intermediate species, illustrating how combined PDF and SAXS analysis is a powerful tool to gain insight into nucleation on an atomic scale. PDF also provides information on the interaction between nanoclusters and solvent, which is shown to depend on the nature of the ligands on the cluster surface.

         <title>Non&#8208;invasive Regulation of Cellular Morphology Using a Photoswitchable Mechanical DNA Polymer</title>

We created a photoswitchable DNA polymer containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides with photoirradiation. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells. This study presents a general strategy to explore nanoscale interactions between stem cells and stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanostructures.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) in which the cells reside provides a dynamic and reversible environment. Spatiotemporal cues are essential when cells are undergoing morphogenesis, repair and differentiation. Emulation of such an intricate system with reversible presentation of nanoscale cues can help us better understand cellular processes and can allow the precise manipulation of cell function in&#8197;vitro. Herein, we formulated a photoswitchable DNA mechanical nanostructure containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides using a photoswitchable DNA polymer with photoirradiation. We found that the DNA polymer reversibly forms two different structures, a relaxed linear and shrunken compact form, observed by AFM. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells between a round shape and spindle shape, thus providing a tool to decipher the language of the ECM better.

         <title>Photoinduced Charge Separation Prompted Intervalence Charge Transfer in a Bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole Bridged Donor&#8208;TCBD Push&#8208;Pull System</title>

Occurrence of intervalence charge transfer in a newly synthesized multi&#8208;modular donor&#8211;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl) diketopyrrolopyrrole hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene entities on the opposite sides is demonstrated. The near&#8208;infrared IVCT band has been used as a diagnostic marker to probe photoinduced electron transfer.







Abstract
Intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), a phenomenon observed in molecular systems comprised of two redox centers differing in oxidation states by one unit, is reported in a novel, newly synthesized, multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (PTZ&#8208;TCBD) entities on the opposite sides. One&#8208;electron reduction of TCBD promoted electron exchange between the two TCBD resulting in IVCT transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. The stabilization energy, &#8722;&#916;Gcom and comproportionation equilibrium constant, Kcom calculated from peak potentials of the split reduction waves were found to be 1.06&#215;104&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and 72.3&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. Further, the IVCT transition was also witnessed during the process of thermodynamically feasible electron transfer upon excitation of the TDPP entity in the system, and served as a diagnostic marker to characterize the electron transfer product. Subsequent transient absorption spectral studies and data analysis by Global and Target analyses revealed occurrence of ultrafast charge separation (kcs&#8776;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1) owing to the close proximity and good communication between the entities of the multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system. The role of central TDPP in promoting IVCT is borne out from the present investigation.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Efficient Capture and Purification of Propylene</title>

A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with free COOH groups and suitable pore confinement demonstrates excellent performance for the important and challenging C3H6/C3H8 separation. 







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) mixture is desired for its potential energy saving on replacing currently deployed and energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Realizing efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation in the emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is very challenging owing to the lack of functional sites for preferential gas binding. By virtue of crystal engineering, we herein report a functionalized HOF (HOF&#8208;16) with free &#8208;COOH sites for the efficient separation of C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. Under ambient conditions, HOF&#8208;16 shows a significant C3H6/C3H8 uptake difference (by 76&#8201;%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to other carboxylic acid&#8208;based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free &#8208;COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high&#8208;density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of HOF&#8208;16 was validated by breakthrough experiments. HOF&#8208;16 is stable towards strong acidity and water.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Protoboration of CF3&#8208;Containing 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
The novel copper&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;dienes with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry afforded the CF3&#8208;containing borated products with good selectivity and efficiency.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing conjugated diene with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry could suppress the well&#8208;known defluorination and provide borated reagents with an intact CF3&#8208;group. Further studies indicated that the functional group tolerance of this chemistry is very well, and the products could be used as versatile precursors for different types of transformations. Importantly, using chiral diphosphine ligand, we have developed the first example for using such starting material to synthesis allylic boron&#8208;reagents which bearing a CF3&#8208;containing chiral center. Notably, the reaction mechanism was intensively studied by DFT calculations, which could reveal the reason that defluorination was inhibited.

         <title>Electrodeposition of Zinc onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the Ionic Liquid [MPPip][TFSI]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20461-20468, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differences of the electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide are presented. The clearly different structures of the deposits on both gold single crystal electrodes reveal a strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc.







Abstract
The improvement of rechargeable zinc/air batteries was a hot topic in recent years. Predominantly, the influence of water and additives on the structure of the Zn deposit and the possible dendrite formation were studied. However, the effect of the surface structure of the underlying substrate was not focused on in detail, yet. We now show the differences in electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. The fundamental processes were initially characterized via cyclic voltammetry and in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. Bulk deposits were then examined using Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Different structures of Zn deposits are observed during the initial stages of electrocrystallisation on both electrodes, which reveals the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc on gold.

         <title>Chromoselective Synthesis of Sulfonyl Chlorides and Sulfonamides with Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20543-20550, September 6, 2021. </description>

Photons are traceless reagents in the photocatalytic system, able to control the reaction pathway. Herein, the carbon nitride photocatalyst is used to obtain three products from the same reaction mixture only varying the excitation light. The developed method is optimized for the synthesis of sulfonyl chlorides and amides. Finally, through different physico&#8208;chemical methods, the rationale behind the chromoselective synthesis is explained.







Abstract
Among external stimuli used to promote a chemical reaction, photocatalysis possesses a unique one&#8212;light. Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S&#8208;arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi&#8208;electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.

         <title>Benchmark Acetylene Binding Affinity and Separation through Induced Fit in a Flexible Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material</title>

We introduce the new flexible physisorbent sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn and reveal that it exhibits an induced fit structural change that results in extraordinary affinity for C2H2 that in turn enables high selectivity for separation of C2H2 over C2H4 and CO2.







Abstract
Structural changes at the active site of an enzyme induced by binding to a substrate molecule can result in enhanced activity in biological systems. Herein, we report that the new hybrid ultramicroporous material sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn exhibits an induced fit binding mechanism when exposed to acetylene, C2H2. The resulting phase change affords exceptionally strong C2H2 binding that in turn enables highly selective C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separation demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments. sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn was observed to exhibit at least four phases: as&#8208;synthesised (&#945;); activated (&#946;); and C2H2 induced phases (&#946;&#8242; and &#947;). sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; exhibited strong affinity for C2H2 at ambient conditions as demonstrated by benchmark isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) of 67.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 validated through in situ pressure gradient differential scanning calorimetry (PG&#8208;DSC). Further, in situ characterisation and DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of the C2H2 induced fit transformation, binding positions and the nature of host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photoredox Catalysis Enables Self&#8208;Reporting Nitric Oxide Release for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20452-20460, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis for self&#8208;reporting nitric oxide release is reported in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin. The NO&#8208;releasing platform eradicates Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treats bacterial infection in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) serves as a key regulator of many physiological processes and as a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non&#8208;invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO&#8208;releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near&#8208;UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity.

This NO&#8208;releasing platform with ciprofloxacin loading can eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treat cutaneous abscesses in&#8197;vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Red-light-mediated photoredox catalysis for self-reporting nitric oxide release is reported in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin. The NO-releasing platform eradicates &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treats bacterial infection in&#8197;vivo.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) serves as a key regulator of many physiological processes and as a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non-invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO-releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near-UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity. We report that coumarin-based NO donors with maximal absorbances at 328&#8197;nm can be activated under (deep) red-light (630 or 700&#8197;nm) irradiation in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin, enabling stoichiometric and self-reporting NO release with a photolysis quantum yield of 8&#8201;% via photoredox catalysis. This NO-releasing platform with ciprofloxacin loading can eradicate &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treat cutaneous abscesses in&#8197;vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

Different aggregation structures of three BDOPV&#8208;based polymers in solution were obtained via subtle adjustment of the molecular structures. By employing contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we directly reveal that the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains highly consistent.







Abstract
The role of solution aggregates on the charge transport process of conjugated polymers in electronic devices has gained increasing attention; however, the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains elusive. Herein, three polymers, FBDOPV&#8208;2T, FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T, and FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T, are designed and synthesized with distinct aggregation behavior in solution. By combining contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor measurements, we track the charge carrier mobility of the aggregates of these polymers from the solution to the thin&#8208;film state. Remarkably, the mobility of these three polymers is found to follow nearly the same trend (FBDOPV&#8208;2T&gt;FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T&#8811;FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T) in both solutions and thin&#8208;film states. The quantitative mobility correlation indicates that the charge transport properties of solution aggregates play a critical role in determining the thin&#8208;film charge transport properties and final device performance. Our results highlight the importance of investigating and controlling solution aggregation structures towards efficient organic electronic devices.

Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized for a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst. In&#8197;situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of the catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process.







Abstract
The multimetallic sulfur&#8208;framework catalytic site of biological nitrogenases allows the efficient conversion of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions. Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized as a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst by sulfur substitution of the surface of FeWO4 nanoparticles. Thus prepared FeWSx@FeWO4 catalysts exhibit a relatively high NH3 production rate of 30.2&#8197;ug&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 16.4&#8201;% at &#8722;0.45&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell; these results have been confirmed via purified 15N2&#8208;isotopic labeling experiments. In situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of the bimetallic sulfide catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process. Therefore, this work can provide guidance for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relationship of NRR catalysts.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical strategy to locally synthesize carbon monoxide (CO), a gaseous messenger molecule, with tunable kinetics is devised. By integrating this strategy with fiber&#8208;based fabrication, diverse CO&#8208;dependent signaling pathways in genetically engineered cells or neurons can be modulated at the microscale.







Abstract
Despite the critical role played by carbon monoxide (CO) in physiological and pathological signaling events, current approaches to deliver this messenger molecule are often accompanied by off&#8208;target effects and offer limited control over release kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an electrochemical approach that affords on&#8208;demand release of CO through reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in the extracellular space. Electrocatalytic generation of CO by cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalysts modulates signaling pathways mediated by a CO receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase. Furthermore, by tuning the applied voltage during electrocatalysis, we explore the effect of the CO release kinetics on CO&#8208;dependent neuronal signaling. Finally, we integrate components of our electrochemical platform into microscale fibers to produce CO in a spatially&#8208;restricted manner and to activate signaling cascades in the targeted cells. By offering on&#8208;demand local synthesis of CO, our approach may facilitate the studies of physiological processes affected by this gaseous molecular messenger.

         <title>Glycopolymer Microarrays with Sub&#8208;Femtomolar Avidity for Glycan Binding Proteins Prepared by Grafted&#8208;To/Grafted&#8208;From Photopolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20350-20357, September 6, 2021. </description>

Sub&#8208;femtomolar avidity with glycan binding protein is achieved in a glycan microarray architecture that controls precisely carbohydrate density and valency. The biomimetic glycopolymers are prepared via a new surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, termed &#8220;grafted&#8208;to/grafted&#8208;from radical photopolymerization&#8221; that was optimized using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization.







Abstract
We report a novel glycan array architecture that binds the mannose&#8208;specific glycan binding protein, concanavalin&#8197;A (ConA), with sub&#8208;femtomolar avidity. A new radical photopolymerization developed specifically for this application combines the grafted&#8208;from thiol&#8211;(meth)acrylate polymerization with thiol&#8211;ene chemistry to graft glycans to the growing polymer brushes. The propagation of the brushes was studied by carrying out this grafted&#8208;to/grafted&#8208;from radical photopolymerization (GTGFRP) at &gt;400 different conditions using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization on surfaces. The effect of brush height and the grafting density of mannosides on the binding of ConA to the brushes was studied systematically, and we found that multivalent and cooperative binding account for the unprecedented sensitivity of the GTGFRP brushes. This study further demonstrates the ease with which new chemistry can be tailored for an application as a result of the advantages of hypersurface photolithography.

         <title>Green Conversion of CO2 and Propargylamines Triggered by Triply Synergistic Catalytic Effects in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

A mixed valence copper&#8208;based cationic framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n was synthesized. The material realized the efficient and green conversion of propargylamine with CO2 in flue gas under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst free conditions.







Abstract
Cyclization of propargylamines with CO2 to obtain 2&#8208;oxazolidone heterocyclic compounds is an essential reaction in industry but it is usually catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal catalysts with organic bases as co&#8208;catalysts under harsh conditions. We have synthesized a unique CuI/CuII mixed valence copper&#8208;based framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n (1) with good solvent and thermal stability, as well as a high density of uncoordinated amino groups evenly distributed in the large nanoscopic channels. Catalytic experiments show that 1 can effectively catalyze the reaction of propargylamines with CO2, and the yield can reach 99&#8201;%. The turnover frequency (TOF) reaches a record value of 230&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of reported noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Importantly, this is the first report of heterogeneously catalyzed green conversion of propargylamines with CO2 without solvents and co&#8208;catalysts under low temperature and atmospheric pressure. A mechanistic study reveals that a triply synergistic catalytic effect between CuI/CuII and uncoordinated amino groups promotes highly efficient and green conversion of CO2. Furthermore, 1 directly catalyzes this reaction with high efficiency when using simulated flue gas as a CO2 source.

Integration of a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework on a conductive indium tin oxide surface affords an electrochemical sensor, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO. Thanks to detecting several inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO demonstrates multifaceted sensing with low detection limits. Benchmark sensing performances are set not only across several single components, but also in the corresponding binary and ternary mixtures.







Abstract
Electrochemical sensors are indispensable in clinical diagnosis, biochemical detection and environmental monitoring, thanks to their ability to detect analytes in real&#8208;time with direct electronic readout. However, electrochemical sensors are challenged by sensitivity&#8212;the need to detect low concentrations, and selectivity&#8212;to detect specific analytes in multicomponent systems. Herein, a porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic framework (PP&#8208;MOF), Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222 is deposited on a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) surface. It affords Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO, a versatile voltammetric sensor able to detect redox&#8208;active analytes such as inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, including nitroaromatics, phenolic and quinone&#8208;hydroquinone toxins, heavy metal ions, biological species, as well as azo dyes. As a working electrode, the high surface area of Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO enables high currents, and therefore leverages highly sensitive analysis. The metalloporphyrin centre facilitates analyte&#8208;specific redox catalysis to simultaneously detect more than one analyte in binary and ternary systems allowing for detection of a wide array of trace pollutants under real&#8208;world conditions, most with high sensitivity.

         <title>Reversible Ligand Exchange in Atomically Dispersed Catalysts for Modulating the Activity and Selectivity of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20528-20534, September 6, 2021. </description>

Coordination environments of atomically dispersed catalysts are important for their catalytic performances. We report the reversible control of the metal coordination environment in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via simple ligand exchange reactions, which could reversibly modulate the catalytic reactivity of the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Rational control of the coordination environment of atomically dispersed catalysts is pivotal to achieve desirable catalytic reactivity. We report the reversible control of coordination structure in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via ligand exchange reactions to reversibly modulate their reactivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CO&#8208;ligated atomically dispersed Rh catalyst exhibited ca. 30&#8208;fold higher ORR activity than the NHx&#8208;ligated catalyst, whereas the latter showed three times higher H2O2 selectivity than the former. Post&#8208;treatments of the catalysts with CO or NH3 allowed the reversible exchange of CO and NHx ligands, which reversibly tuned oxidation state of metal centers and their ORR activity and selectivity. DFT calculations revealed that more reduced oxidation state of CO&#8208;ligated Rh site could further stabilize the *OOH intermediate, facilitating the two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron pathway ORR. The reversible ligand exchange reactions were generalized to Ir&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Understanding the Roles of Electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ in Selectivity&#8208;Tuned 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20535-20542, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism for cobalt&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation is revealed. A combined experimental and theoretical study shows that a Co3+ species is capable of oxidizing the formyl group to produce carboxylate but remains inert towards oxidation of the hydroxyl group. In contrast, a Co4+ species is required for the initial oxidation of the hydroxyl group in HMF.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is among the most promising candidates for electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the intrinsic active sites and detailed mechanism of this catalyst remains unclear. We combine experimental evidence and a theoretical study to show that electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ species act as chemical oxidants but with distinct roles in selective HMF oxidation. It is found that Co3+ is only capable of oxidizing formyl group to produce carboxylate while Co4+ is required for the initial oxidation of hydroxyl group with significantly faster kinetics. As a result, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co&#8208;catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20443-20451, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed controlled alternating terpolymerization of perfluorinated vinyl ethers has been established, enabling the on&#8208;demand synthesis of various fluorinated terpolymers driven by light. This method offers a versatile and convenient platform to tailor fluoropolymers, which facilitates the preparation of novel block copolymers and engineering of high&#8208;performance solid terpolymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Polymerizations of perfluorinated vinyl ethers (PFVEs) provide an important category of fluoropolymers that have received considerable interests in applications. In this work, we report the development of an organocatalyzed controlled radical alternating terpolymerization of PFVEs and vinyl ethers (VEs) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method not only enables the synthesis of a broad scope of fluorinated terpolymers of low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity, facilitating tuning the chemical compositions by rationally choosing the type and/or ratio of comonomers, but also allows temporal control of chain&#8208;growth, as well as the preparation of a variety of novel fluorinated block copolymers. To showcase the versatility of this method, fluorinated alternating terpolymers have been synthesized and customized to simultaneously display a variety of desirable properties for solid polymer electrolyte design, creating new opportunities in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Synergistical Dipole&#8211;Dipole Interaction Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20437-20442, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipole&#8211;dipole interaction induced self&#8208;assembly of phenoxazine&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting material, N01, is achieved by introducing a hexyl bromide side&#8208;chain to tune its self&#8208;assembling properties. N01 exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, extraction and perovskite growth, with a conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;% to be realized in an inverted PSC.







Abstract
Delicately designed dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor&#8208;&#960; linker&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) HTMs, N01 and N02, which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8&#8208;di(n&#8208;hexyloxy)&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene as a &#960; linker, with 10&#8208;bromohexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine and 10&#8208;hexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine as donors, respectively. The N01 molecules form a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated network governed by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three&#8208;dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. Consequently, N01 as a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;%.

         <title>Cooperative Effects in Switchable Catalysis: Enhancing Double&#8208;Click Reaction Yield of Symmetrical Rotaxanes</title>

Like an eagle spreading its wings wide, the closed structure opens its hidden catalytic sites upon addition of an iron trigger thus furnishing a cavity for a double&#8208;click conversion toward rotaxanes. Surprisingly, a close distance match is not needed for double activation.







Abstract
Reversible switching between the closed cyclic dimeric assembly [Cu2(1)2]2+ (OFF state) and the extended dimeric homoleptic complex [FeCu2(1)2]4+ (ON State) by addition/removal of Fe2+ triggered catalysis of a double&#8208;click reaction and high yield preparation of [2]rotaxanes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide valuable general insight for double&#8208;click strategies by revealing cooperative effects in the second cycloaddition step due to a distance&#8208;tolerant preorganization of the first&#8208;click product by the two copper(I)&#8208;loaded phenanthroline subunits of [FeCu2(1)2]4+.

A dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which shows excellent charge collection properties and multisite defect&#8208;healing effects. All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. All&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibit an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.

DFT calculation reveals the beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the ligand and the substrate in the turnover&#8208;limiting migration insertion step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a [5+2] cycloaddition between readily accessible 1&#8208;indanones and internal alkynes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed activation of less strained C&#8722;C bonds. The reaction is enabled by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligand and a carefully modified temporary directing group. A wide range of functional groups is tolerated, and the method provides straightforward access to diverse benzocycloheptenones that are hard to access otherwise. DFT studies of the reaction mechanism imply the migration insertion as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and suggest beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the transition states.

A one&#8208;pot green approach for in situ implanting of single tungsten sites (up to 12.7&#8197;wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free conditions is reported. The W/UiO&#8208;66(Zr) SSCs display extraordinary ODS activity under very mild condition, achieving complete oxidation of sulfur compounds (1000&#8197;ppm S) at room temperature within 30&#8197;min by using diluted H2O2 as oxidant.







Abstract
Design of single&#8208;site catalysts with catalytic sites at atomic&#8208;scale and high atom utilization, provides new opportunities to gain superior catalytic performance for targeted reactions. In this contribution, we report a one&#8208;pot green approach for in situ implanting of single tungsten sites (up to 12.7&#8197;wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free condition. The catalysts displayed extraordinary activity for the oxidative removal of sulfur compounds (1000&#8197;ppm S) at room temperature within 30&#8197;min. The turnover frequency (TOF) value can reach 44.0&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, which is 109.0, 12.3 and 1.2 times higher than that of pristine UiO&#8208;66(Zr), WO3, and WCl6 (homogeneous catalyst). Theoretical and experimental studies show that the anchored W sites can react with oxidant readily and generate WVI&#8208;peroxo intermediates that determine the reaction activity. Our work not only manifests the application of SSCs in the field of desulfurization of fuel oil but also opens a new solvent&#8208;free avenue for fabricating MOFs based SSCs.

         <title>Physicochemical Understanding of the Impact of Pore Environment and Species of Adsorbates on Adsorption Behaviour</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20504-20510, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative strength of intermolecular interaction between adsorbates and substrate influences adsorption behaviour. For Ar, the capillary condensation of ZIF&#8208;412 starts at lower pressure than for MOF&#8208;205 due to different adsorbate&#8211;substrate interactions. However, this effect becomes negligible for adsorbates with strong interaction among adsorbates (CO2).







Abstract
For a better design of adsorbents, it is important to know the intermolecular interaction among adsorbates and host material, leading to improved guest selectivity and uptake capacity. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of the interaction among adsorbates and substrate, controlled by the pore environment and species of adsorbates, on the adsorption behaviour. We report the unique CO2 adsorption behaviour of MOF&#8208;205 due to distinct pore geometry. The precise analysis through gas&#8208;adsorption crystallography with molecular simulation shows that capillary condensation of CO2 in MOF&#8208;205 occurs preferentially in the large dodecahedral pore rather than the small tetrahedral pore, because the interaction of CO2 with MOF&#8208;205 framework is weaker than that among CO2 molecules, while Ar and N2 are sequentially filled into two different pores of MOF&#8208;205 according to their size. Comparison of the materials with different pore environments reveals that the relative strength of the adsorbate&#8211;adsorbate and adsorbate&#8211;substrate interaction gives rise to different shapes of isotherms.

The first sodium hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a new deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], are optimally aligned to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with O&#8722;H bonds, which makes Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] have a large birefringence and band gap.







Abstract
Maximizing the optical anisotropy in birefringent materials has emerged as an efficient route for modulating the polarization&#8208;dependent light propagation. Currently, the generation of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) polarized light below 200&#8197;nm is essential but challenging due to the interdisciplinary significance and insufficiency of high&#8208;performing birefringent crystals. Herein, by introducing multiple heteroanionic units, the first sodium difluorodihydroxytriborate&#8208;boric acid Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a novel deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], optimally align to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with hydrogens, which results in an extremely large birefringence and band gap. The well&#8208;ordered OH/F anions in [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3] were identified and confirmed by various approaches, and also the origin of large birefringence was theoretically discussed. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing hydrogen involved heteroanionic units to design crystals with large birefringence, and also expand the alternative system of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals with new hydroxyfluorooxoborates.

         <title>Kinetic Selection in the Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Autocatalytic Reaction Networks that Produce Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20366-20375, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical system is presented where polymerization of peptide monomers results in predominantly macrocyclic oligomers. Using this system, we make a clear demonstration of how the combination of autocatalysis, diversity of products, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions results in the selection of complex products.







Abstract
Autocatalytic reaction networks are instrumental for validating scenarios for the emergence of life on Earth and for synthesizing life de novo. Here, we demonstrate that dimeric thioesters of tripeptides with the general structure (Cys&#8208;Xxx&#8208;Gly&#8208;SEt)2 form strongly interconnected autocatalytic reaction networks that predominantly generate macrocyclic peptides up to 69 amino acids long. Some macrocycles of 6&#8211;12 amino acids were isolated from the product pool and were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. We studied the autocatalytic formation of macrocycles in a flow reactor in the presence of acrylamide, whose conjugate addition to thiols served as a model &#8220;removal&#8221; reaction. These results indicate that even not template&#8208;assisted autocatalytic production combined with competing removal of molecular species in an open compartment could be a feasible route for selecting functional molecules during the pre&#8208;Darwinian stages of molecular evolution.

     alt="Kinetic Selection in the Out-of-Equilibrium Autocatalytic Reaction Networks that Produce Macrocyclic Peptides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemical system is presented where polymerization of peptide monomers results in predominantly macrocyclic oligomers. Using this system, we make a clear demonstration of how the combination of autocatalysis, diversity of products, and out-of-equilibrium conditions results in the selection of complex products.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autocatalytic reaction networks are instrumental for validating scenarios for the emergence of life on Earth and for synthesizing life de novo. Here, we demonstrate that dimeric thioesters of tripeptides with the general structure (Cys-Xxx-Gly-SEt)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form strongly interconnected autocatalytic reaction networks that predominantly generate macrocyclic peptides up to 69 amino acids long. Some macrocycles of 6&#8211;12 amino acids were isolated from the product pool and were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray analysis. We studied the autocatalytic formation of macrocycles in a flow reactor in the presence of acrylamide, whose conjugate addition to thiols served as a model &#8220;removal&#8221; reaction. These results indicate that even not template-assisted autocatalytic production combined with competing removal of molecular species in an open compartment could be a feasible route for selecting functional molecules during the pre-Darwinian stages of molecular evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hydroxylation and Alkoxylation of Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20391-20399, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation of aryl fluorides via &#951;6&#8208;coordination was achieved. This method was also applicable in the alkoxylation. A Meisenheimer&#8208;type intermediate was successfully isolated and well characterized. Density functional theory calculations and mechanistic studies suggested a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile for the SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is a powerful strategy for incorporating a heteroatom into an aromatic ring by displacement of a leaving group with a nucleophile, but this method is limited to electron&#8208;deficient arenes. We have now established a reliable method for accessing phenols and phenyl alkyl ethers via catalytic SNAr reactions. The method is applicable to a broad array of electron&#8208;rich and neutral aryl fluorides, which are inert under classical SNAr conditions. Although the mechanism of SNAr reactions involving metal arene complexes is hypothesized to involve a stepwise pathway (addition followed by elimination), experimental data that support this hypothesis is still under exploration. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest either a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile. Notably, we isolated a rhodium &#951;5&#8208;cyclohexadienyl complex intermediate with an sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon bearing both a nucleophile and a leaving group.

         <title>Transformation Pathway from CdSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters with Absorption Doublets at 373/393&#8197;nm to Clusters at 434/460&#8197;nm</title>

Magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) have their own unique precursor compounds (PCs). A PC&#8208;enabled pathway has been proposed for the transformation from photoluminescent (PL) CdSe displaying one absorption doublet at 373/393 (dMSC&#8208;393) to 433/460 (dMSC&#8208;460). This pathway contains three key steps with monomer addition (Step&#8197;2) transferring PC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;460.







Abstract
Divergent interpretations have appeared in the literature regarding the structural nature and evolutionary behavior for photoluminescent CdSe nanospecies with sharp doublets in optical absorption. We report a comprehensive description of the transformation pathway from one CdSe nanospecies displaying an absorption doublet at 373/393&#8197;nm to another species with a doublet at 433/460&#8197;nm. These two nanospecies are zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) with 3D quantum confinement, and are labeled dMSC&#8208;393 and dMSC&#8208;460, respectively. Synchrotron&#8208;based small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) returns a radius of gyration of 0.92&#8197;nm for dMSC&#8208;393 and 1.14&#8197;nm for dMSC&#8208;460, and indicates that both types are disc shaped with the exponent of the SAXS form factor equal to 2.1. The MSCs develop from their unique counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are labeled PC&#8208;393 and PC&#8208;460, respectively. For the dMSC&#8208;393 to dMSC&#8208;460 transformation, the proposed PC&#8208;enabled pathway is comprised of three key steps, dMSC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;393 (Step&#8197;1), PC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;460 (Step&#8197;2 involving monomer addition), and PC&#8208;460 to dMSC&#8208;460 (Step&#8197;3). The present study provides a framework for understanding the PC&#8208;based evolution of MSCs and how PCs enable transformations between MSCs.

         <title>Holistic View on Materials Development: Water Electrolysis as a Case Study</title>

In the context of a circular economy, the design process of new materials has to change. The performance&#8208;based mindset must be replaced by a holistic approach to efficient materials. For this transition, the collaboration between materials science and sustainability assessment must be improved, and new ways of including assessments into design processes and standardized figures of sustainable merit must be defined.







Abstract
In view of rising ecological awareness, materials development is primarily aimed at improving the performance and efficiency of innovative and more elaborate materials. However, a materials performance figure of merit should include essential aspects of materials: environmental impact, economic constraints, technical feasibility, etc. Thus, we promote the inclusion of sustainability criteria already during the materials design process. With such a holistic design approach, new products may be more likely to meet the circular economy requirements than when traditional development strategies are pursued. Using catalysts for water electrolysis as an example, we present a modelling method based on experimental data to holistically evaluate processes.

The transformation pathway for magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) with absorption doublets has remained unknown so far. Meng Zhang, Jianrong Zeng, Kui Yu et&#8197;al. propose in their Research Article on page&#8197;20358 that the transformation from the MSCs with characteristic optical absorption at 373/393&#8197;nm (dMSC&#8208;393) to those at 433/460&#8197;nm (dMSC&#8208;460) occurs via the addition reaction of the CdSe monomers to the precursor compound of dMSC&#8208;393.

By combining X&#8208;ray total scattering and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to obtain unique insight into the formation of atomically precise nanoclusters. In a study of bismuth oxide clusters on page&#8197;20407, Michael Mehring, Kirsten&#8197;M.&#8197;&#216;. Jensen et&#8197;al. investigate the formation of&#160;[Bi38O45] clusters from&#160;[Bi6O8], and show that an intermediate structure of [Bi22O26] plays an important role in the process. This intermediate structure was identified through a new automated modelling&#160;approach.

Studies of proton conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have focused on increasing the charge carrier density. Of equal importance is the correlation of intrinsic properties (porosity and surface functionalization) of MOFs with conductivity. In their Communication on page&#8197;20173, Jihan Kim, Dae&#8208;Woon Lim, Hiroshi Kitagawa et&#8197;al. establish a correlation for proton conduction in MOFs with porosity and surface functionality. The confinement effect is essential for strengthening the hydrogen bonds leading to high proton conductivity.

1D hollow nanostructures have been considered as promising electrode materials for different electrochemical energy storage applications. This Minireview gives an overview of recent achievements in the rational design and engineering of 1D hollow nanostructures as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. This unique class of electrodes offers significant advantages for boosting the electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hollow nanostructures result in intriguing physicochemical properties and wide applications, especially for electrochemical energy storage applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of recent developments in the rational design and engineering of various kinds of 1D hollow nanostructures with well&#8208;designed architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and enhanced electrochemical properties for different kinds of electrochemical energy storage applications (i.e. lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, lithium&#8208;selenium sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes, metal&#8208;air batteries, supercapacitors). We conclude with prospects on some critical challenges and possible future research directions in this field. It is anticipated that further innovative studies on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications will be stimulated.

This Review summarizes the use of oils and fats as a renewable raw material by covering novel examples, such as selective oxidation or cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds in fatty acids, isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarbonylation, and the use of these renewables for polymer chemistry. Further topics include biocatalysis, the optimization of microorganisms by metabolic engineering, and the generation of new oil qualities in existing crop plants.







Abstract
Oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin remain an important renewable feedstock for the chemical industry. Their industrial use has increased during the last 10&#8197;years from 31 to 51 million tonnes annually. Remarkable achievements made in the field of oleochemistry in this timeframe are summarized herein, including the reduction of fatty esters to ethers, the selective oxidation and oxidative cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds, the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;branched fatty compounds, the isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarbonylation, and olefin metathesis. The use of oleochemicals for the synthesis of a great variety of polymeric materials has increased tremendously, too. In addition to lipases and phospholipases, other enzymes have found their way into biocatalytic oleochemistry. Important achievements have also generated new oil qualities in existing crop plants or by using microorganisms optimized by metabolic engineering.

Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses chemical energy stored in molecules to sustain non&#8208;equilibrium structures. This Review describes how chemical energy can be used to control the self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules. The ability of chemists to implement the described strategies in a synthetic context will permit the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high&#8208;energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified according to a distinguishable physical&#8208;organic basis. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities they offer. Specific attention is paid to the discussion of chemically fueled non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly. We discuss the meaning of non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly, its kinetic origin, and strategies to develop synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems.

         <title>Sequential Pd0&#8208; and PdII&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations: Enantioselective Heck and Nucleopalladation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20231-20236, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successive cyclization and cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl aryl iodides and alkyne&#8208;appended nucleophiles via an enantioselective domino&#8208;Heck and regioselective nucleopalladation is reported. Heterocycles originated from N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles were successful in conjunction with the enantioselective formation of dihydrobenzofurans, indolines, chromans, indanes, and polycyclic indolines.







Abstract
An enantioselective consecutive cyclization/coupling process, catalyzed by palladium is reported. Stereoinduction arises from an enantioselective carbopalladation, generating an intermediate which promotes a nucleopalladation step. The dual cyclization sequence was compatible with a variety of alkyne&#8208;tethered oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles, and a variety of alkenyl&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, to forge numerous bisheterocycles in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

Two racemic compounds are combined to form a stable conglomerate system. Both compounds are simultaneously resolved through a single preferential cocrystallization process, showing excellent enantiopurity towards both compounds.







Abstract
We tap into an unexplored area of preferential crystallization, being the first to develop simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization. We highlight how the two racemic compounds RS&#8208;mandelic acid (MAN) and RS&#8208;etiracetam (ETI) can be combined together as enantiospecific R&#8208;MAN&#8901;R&#8208;ETI and S&#8208;MAN&#8901;S&#8208;ETI cocrystals forming a stable conglomerate system and subsequently develop a cyclic preferential crystallization allowing to simultaneous resolve both compounds. The developed process leads to excellent enantiopurity both for etiracetam (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) and mandelic acid (ee&#8776;95&#8201;%) enantiomers.

         <title>Controlling the Covalent Reactivity of a Kinase Inhibitor with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20178-20183, September 6, 2021. </description>

To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, we introduce the combination of covalent inhibitors, targeting a cysteine in the vicinity of the ATP binding site of the c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) and diazocine photoswitches. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that our lead inhibitor is a poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitor in the dark and undergoes proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Covalent kinase inhibitors account for some of the most successful drugs that have recently entered the clinic and many others are in preclinical development. A common strategy is to target cysteines in the vicinity of the ATP binding site using an acrylamide electrophile. To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, it could be advantageous to control the reactivity of these electrophiles with light. Here, we introduce covalent inhibitors of the kinase JNK3 that function as photoswitchable affinity labels (PALs). Our lead compounds contain a diazocine photoswitch, are poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitors in the dark, and become effective covalent inhibitors after irradiation with visible light. Our proposed mode of action is supported by X&#8208;ray structures that explain why these compounds are unreactive in the dark and undergo proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following exposure to light.

         <title>Understanding and Engineering the Stereoselectivity of Humulene Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20308-20312, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
AsR6 is a type I sesquiterpene cyclase with very low homology to other terpene cyclases. It has a unique bi&#8208;magnesium diphosphate binding site and thus lacks the canonical terpene cyclase aspartate&#8208;rich signature sequences. One magnesium is replaced by the &#1013;&#8208;ammonium ion of a conserved lysine. AsR6 can use FPP and both enantiomers of NPP as substrate. In addition, a single mutation directs formation of 2E or 2Z humulene with very high selectivity.







Abstract
The non&#8208;canonical terpene cyclase AsR6 is responsible for the formation of 2E,6E,9E&#8208;humulene during the biosynthesis of the tropolone sesquiterpenoid (TS) xenovulene A. The structures of unliganded AsR6 and of AsR6 in complex with an in crystallo cyclized reaction product and thiolodiphosphate reveal a new farnesyl diphosphate binding motif that comprises a unique binuclear Mg2+&#8208;cluster and an essential K289 residue that is conserved in all humulene synthases involved in TS formation. Structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AsR6 and its homologue EupR3 identify a single residue, L285/M261, that controls the production of either 2E,6E,9E&#8208; or 2Z,6E,9E&#8208;humulene. A possible mechanism for the observed stereoselectivity was investigated using different isoprenoid precursors and results demonstrate that M261 has gatekeeping control over product formation.

Two benzo&#8208;fused tri[8]annulenes were synthesized via cyclotrimerization reactions, introducing two valid model compounds of the yet elusive carbon allotrope cubic graphite. Both conformers do not interconvert via temperature&#8208; or light&#8208;induced stimuli.







Abstract
Cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[3,4:7,8]cycloocta[1,2&#8208;l]phenanthrene with potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in the presence of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst afforded two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon stereoisomers consisting of three cyclooctatetraene (COT) moieties connected via a central benzene ring. Both isomeric tri[8]annulenes were obtained selectively through the choice of the catalyst: The &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;form (Ru catalyst) displayed a threefold symmetrywith the COT subunits forming the side walls of a (chiral) molecular cup. In the thermodynamically more stable &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;isomer (Pd catalyst), one of the three boat&#8208;shaped COTs was flipped over and faced the opposite molecular hemisphere with respect to the central benzene ring as evidenced by crystal structure analysis. Both title compounds are small segments of &#8220;cubic graphite&#8221;, an elusive carbon allotrope.

Interfacial assemblies are spontaneously formed on various substrates in aqueous conditions via simultaneous covalent and noncovalent interactions using tannic acid and the small aromatic molecule benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. The robust and colorless coatings enable the subsequent on&#8208;surface synthesis or modification for the development of various multifunctional coatings and nanosystems.







Abstract
Interfacial modular assembly has emerged as an adaptable strategy for engineering the surface properties of substrates in biomedicine, photonics, and catalysis. Herein, we report a versatile and robust coating (pBDT&#8208;TA), self&#8208;assembled from tannic acid (TA) and a self&#8208;polymerizing aromatic dithiol (i.e., benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol, BDT), that can be engineered on diverse substrates with a precisely tuned thickness (5&#8211;40&#8197;nm) by varying the concentration of BDT used. The pBDT&#8208;TA coating is stabilized by covalent (disulfide) bonds and supramolecular (&#960;&#8208;&#960;) interactions, endowing the coating with high stability in various harsh aqueous environments across ionic strength, pH, temperature (e.g., 100&#8197;mM NaCl, HCl (pH&#8197;1) or NaOH (pH&#8197;13), and water at 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as surfactant solution (e.g., 100&#8197;mM Triton X&#8208;100) and biological buffer (e.g., Dulbecco's phosphate&#8208;buffered saline), as validated by experiments and simulations. Moreover, the reported pBDT&#8208;TA coating enables secondary reactions on the coating for engineering hybrid adlayers (e.g., ZIF&#8208;8 shells) via phenolic&#8208;mediated adhesion, and the facile integration of aromatic fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine B) via &#960; interactions without requiring elaborate synthetic processes.

         <title>Mechanistic Study of the Aqueous Reaction of Organic Peroxides with HSO3&#8722; on the Surface of a Water Droplet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20200-20203, September 6, 2021. </description>

The organic peroxide&#8211;HSO3&#8722; reaction at the aqueous surface proceeds through two pathways, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. The results have important atmospheric implications.







Abstract
Aqueous reactions between organic peroxides and SO2 are of intense interest in atmospheric science because of their ubiquitous implications for sulfate formation in secondary aerosols. However, the relative yields of the reaction products (inorganic vs. organic sulfates) remain controversial (i.e., 90&#8201;% vs. 40&#8211;70&#8201;% for inorganic sulfate) due in part to the lack of understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, our computational results suggest that the reactions of HSO3&#8722; (dissolved SO2) with organic peroxides are initiated on the surface of water nanodroplets and then proceed under two reaction pathways, in which the S atom of HSO3&#8722; attacks either the O1 or O2 atom of the peroxide group &#8208;O(O2)O(O1)H, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. Notably, we find that thse reaction initiated by O1 atom exhibits a relatively low energy barrier and high reaction rate, which favours the formation of inorganic sulfate.

Catalytic formation of N&#8722;B bonds from atmospheric N2, chloroboranes and electrons is achieved with (triphosphine)molybdenum complexes.







Abstract
Catalytic formation of borylamines from atmospheric N2 is achieved for the first time using a series of homogenous (triphosphine)Mo complexes. Stepwise functionalization of the (triphosphine)Mo&#8208;nitrido complex with chloroborane led to the synthesis of the imido complex. Electrochemical characterization of the (PPP)Mo&#8208;nitrido and (PPP)Mo&#8208;borylimido complexes showed that the latter is much more easily reduced.

         <title>Tuning Electrostatic Gating of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes by Controlling Protein Orientation in Biosensing Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20184-20189, September 6, 2021. </description>

Nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations allowed the control of local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulation of the conductance gating effect upon sensing protein targets.







Abstract
The ability to detect proteins through gating conductance by their unique surface electrostatic signature holds great potential for improving biosensing sensitivity and precision. Two challenges are: (1) defining the electrostatic surface of the incoming ligand protein presented to the conductive surface; (2) bridging the Debye gap to generate a measurable response. Herein, we report the construction of nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations; this allowed us to control the local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulate the conductance gating effect upon binding incoming protein targets. Using a &#946;&#8208;lactamase binding protein (BLIP2) as the capture protein attached to carbon nanotube field effect transistors in different defined orientations. Device conductance had influence on binding TEM&#8208;1, an important &#946;&#8208;lactamase involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Conductance increased or decreased depending on TEM&#8208;1 presenting either negative or positive local charge patches, demonstrating that local electrostatic properties, as opposed to protein net charge, act as the key driving force for electrostatic gating. This, in turn can, improve our ability to tune the gating of electrical biosensors toward optimized detection, including for AMR as outlined herein.

A facile and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin staple construction is introduced, where the dipyrrin moiety serves as a novel multifunctional staple linker for targeted protein imaging and selective metal sensing.







Abstract
We introduce a new and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin construction, with full scope of proteinogenic amino acids and different ring sizes. Various bicyclic peptides can be created by dipyrrin&#8208;based crosslinking and double dipyrrin&#8208;ring formation. The embedded dipyrrin can be either transformed to fluorescent BODIPY and then utilized as cancer&#8208;selective targeted protein imaging probe in vitro, or directly employed as a selective metal sensor in aqueous media. This work provides a valuable addition to the peptide macrocyclization toolbox, and a blueprint for the development of multifunctional dipyrrin linkers in cyclopeptides for a wide range of potential bioapplications.

Enantioselective synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkyne&#8208;bearing malononitrile and terminal alkynes using a desymmetrization strategy. The regioselectivity of pyridine is controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.







Abstract
A Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition for synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed. The regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities are controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Pyridines with 5&#8208;substitutents could be obtained with &gt;20:1 regioselectivity and up to 94&#8201;% ee when terminal alkyl, alkenyl or silyl alkynes and DTBM/Ph&#8208;based NPN* ligand L6 were used. Terminal aryl alkynes and Ph/Bn&#8208;based ligand L4 leads to formation of pyridines with 6&#8208;substitutents in up to 99&#8201;% ee.

Disclosed herein for the first time is the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene. A portfolio of strategically designed, easily accessible dual&#8208;function reagents are applied to a radical docking&#8208;migration cascade. The protocol has broad substrate scope and efficiently increases the degree of unsaturation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated difunctionalization of alkenes provides a promising approach to introduce one alkenyl or alkynyl group to target compounds. However, simultaneous installation of two unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds via alkene difunctionalization remains elusive, attributable to the high instability and transient lifetimes of alkenyl and alkynyl radicals. Herein, we report the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes for the first time, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene. A portfolio of strategically designed, easily accessible dual&#8208;function reagents are applied to a radical docking&#8208;migration cascade. The protocol has broad substrate scope and efficiently increases the degree of unsaturation.

A nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms was developed as a narrowband sky&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitter for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A design concept for inducing a synergetic effect on the luminescence function by exquisite multi&#8208;heteroatom hybridization is presented.







Abstract
Developing organic luminophores with unique capability of strong narrowband emission is both crucial and challenging for the further advancement of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system (BSBS&#8208;N1), which was strategically embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, was developed as a new multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. Narrowband sky&#8208;blue emission with a peak at 478&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum of 24&#8197;nm, and photoluminescence quantum yield of 89&#8201;% was obtained with BSBS&#8208;N1. Additionally, the spin&#8208;orbit coupling was enhanced by incorporating two sulfur atoms, thereby facilitating the spin&#8208;flipping process between the excited triplet and singlet states. OLEDs based on BSBS&#8208;N1 as a sky&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter achieved a high maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 21.0&#8201;%, with improved efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich High&#8208;Entropy Oxide Nanosheets for Efficient 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20253-20258, September 6, 2021. </description>

Defect&#8208;rich high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) nanosheets with high surface area are synthesized through a plasma strategy under low&#8208;temperature. The unique structural and compositional advantages endow the HEOs nanosheets with superior electrocatalytic activity for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron&#8208;scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here we report a low&#8208;temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect&#8208;rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 nanosheets deliver improved activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high&#8208;temperature method. Our method opens new opportunities for synthesizing nanostructured HEOs with great potential applications.

         <title>Void Space versus Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20173-20177, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Void space and pore surface functionalization are important structural factors for the design of proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. The priority of these factors was studied systematically, and a MOF with lower porosity and high pore surface functionalization was found to have remarkably high proton conductivity. On the other hand, high porosity proved inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity (see picture).







Abstract
Void space and functionality of the pore surface are important structural factors for proton&#8208;conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnated with conducting media. However, no clear study has compared their priority factors, which need to be considered when designing proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. Herein, we demonstrate the effects of void space and pore&#8208;surface modification on proton conduction in MOFs through the surface&#8208;modified isoreticular MOF&#8208;74(Ni) series [Ni2(dobdc or dobpdc), dobdc=2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and dobpdc=4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate]. The MOF with lower porosity with the same surface functionality showed higher proton conductivity than that with higher porosity despite including a smaller amount of conducting medium. Density functional theory calculations suggest that strong hydrogen bonding between molecules of the conducting medium at high porosity is inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity.

         <title>Selective C&#8211;F Bond Allylation of Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20237-20242, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By capitalizing on the unique fluorine effects, a mono&#8208;selective C&#8722;F bond allylation of trifluoromethylalkenes, which proceeds through a cascade of nucleophilic SN2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and Cope rearrangement, was achieved under operationally convenient conditions.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of CF3 group represents an appealing strategy for the incorporation of pharmaceutically privileged difluoromethylene moiety. Despite the recent significant advancement attained in the functionalization of Ar&#8208;CF3 molecules, prescriptions amenable for alkenyl&#8208;CF3 congeners remain sufficiently inadequate. Herein, we report a strategically novel protocol for the C&#8722;F bond elaboration of trifluoromethylalkene derivatives. By using readily available allyl metallics as nucleophilic coupling partner, the present reaction enables an expedient construction of structurally diversified CF2&#8208;bridged 1,5&#8208;dienes. Furthermore, the exquisite selectivity observed in this transformation is revealed to be based on the underlying mechanism that consists of a cascade of nucleophilic SN2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and electronically promoted Cope rearrangement.

Furthermore, the exquisite selectivity observed in this transformation is revealed to be based on the underlying mechanism that consists of a cascade of nucleophilic S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and electronically promoted Cope rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis as Efficient Tool for the Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydroxamic Acids for Acyl Nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>

Hydroxamic acids were electrochemically oxidised to initiate acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with 1,3&#8208;dienes. By using alternating current, their often encountered electrochemically induced decomposition could be suppressed to generate the desired cycloaddition products in up to 96&#8201;% yield. The optimisation of this reaction was performed using the Design of Experiments approach.







Abstract
The acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with electrochemically oxidised hydroxamic acids is described. By using alternating current electrolysis, their typical electro&#8208;induced decomposition could be suppressed in favour of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine cycloaddition products. The reaction was optimised using Design of Experiments (DoE) and a sensitivity test was conducted. A mixture of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol served as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane, thus giving products of high purity after evaporation of the volatiles without further purification. The optimised reaction conditions were applied to various 1,3&#8208;dienes and hydroxamic acids, giving up to 96&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of Enterocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20269-20273, September 6, 2021. </description>

Entering Nature's Design Office: The highly oxygenated natural product enterocin, which has so far resisted total synthetic attempts, was obtained in a biomimetic key step from triketone 1, which in turn was assembled from an L&#8208;arabinose&#8208;derived core fragment with a defined absolute configuration.







Abstract
The first chemical total synthesis of the highly oxygenated polyketide enterocin has been accomplished. The key step of the synthesis was a late&#8208;stage biomimetic reaction cascade involving two intramolecular aldol reactions in which each step proceeded in 52&#8201;% yield (averaged) and which established four of the seven stereogenic centers. The pivotal precursor for the cascade reaction was assembled from three readily available building blocks. A chiral dithioacetal with two stereogenic centers originating from L&#8208;arabinose represented the core fragment to both ends of which the other building blocks were attached by aldol reactions. The remaining stereogenic center was installed by Davis oxygenation immediately prior to the key step.

         <title>HPM&#8208;16, a Stable Interrupted Zeolite with a Multidimensional Mixed Medium&#8211;Large Pore System Containing Supercages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20249-20252, September 6, 2021. </description>

HPM&#8208;16 is a new interrupted zeolite with 3D intersecting 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8197;MR channels containing 30&#8197;&#197; long supercages. The structure, with a very long b&#8208;axis (&gt;50&#8197;&#197;), was solved by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D&#8197;electron diffraction. Degermanated HPM&#8208;16 is stable up to 800&#8201;&#176;C. Several derived structures were studied, including a recently reported one.







Abstract
HPM&#8208;16 is a highly porous germanosilicate zeolite with an interrupted framework that contains a three&#8208;dimensional system of 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8208;membered ring (MR) pores. The 10(12)&#8197;MR pore in the b&#8197;direction is a 10&#8197;MR pore with long 12&#8197;MR stretches forming 30&#8197;&#197; long tubular supercages. Along one direction the 10&#8197;MR pores are fused, meaning that the separation between adjacent pores consists of a single tetrahedron that is, additionally, connected to only three additional tetrahedra (a Q3). These fused pores are thus decorated by T&#8208;OH groups along the whole diffusion path, creating a hydrophilic region embedded in an otherwise essentially hydrophobic environment. The structure is built from highly porous 12&#215;12&#215;12&#8197;MR uninterrupted layers that are connected to each other through Q3 producing a second system of 10&#215;10&#215;10&#8197;MR pores. This zeolite can be extensively degermanated yielding a material with high thermal stability, despite its interrupted nature.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on MoS2 Enables Large Interlayers and Unlocked Basal Planes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20286-20293, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ molecular engineering of structure defect manufacturing and O&#8208;doping unlocks the MoS2 basal plane and simultaneously upgrades its interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity. These merits enable highly efficient 3D Zn&#8208;ion transport in the MoS2 lattice along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus leading to fast reaction kinetics and the exceptional rate performance in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;storage behaviors of MoS2&#8208;based cathodes mainly rely on the ion&#8208;(de)intercalation at edge sites but are limited by the inactive basal plane. Herein, an in&#8208;situ molecular engineering strategy in terms of structure defects manufacturing and O&#8208;doping is proposed for MoS2 (designated as D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O) to unlock the inert basal plane, expand the interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), and produce abundant 1T&#8208;phase. The tailored D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O with excellent hydrophilicity and high conductivity allows the 3D Zn2+ transport along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus achieving the exceptional high rate capability. Zn2+ diffusion through the basal plane is verified by DFT computations. As a proof of concept, the wearable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn battery employing the D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O cathode operates stably even under severe bending conditions, showing great application prospects. This work opens a new window for designing high&#8208;performance layered cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Alkyl Transposition in Allylic Alcohols Enabled by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20190-20195, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is described for the isomerization of acyclic allylic alcohols into &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones via 1,3&#8208;alkyl transposition. This reaction proceeds via light&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of the O&#8722;H bond in an allylic alcohol substrate, followed by C&#8722;C &#946;&#8208;scission of the resulting alkoxy radical to form an enone and an alkyl radical that may recombine via radical conjugate addition.

A method is described for the isomerization of acyclic allylic alcohols into &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones via 1,3&#8208;alkyl transposition. This reaction proceeds via light&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of the O&#8722;H bond in the allylic alcohol substrate, followed by C&#8722;C &#946;&#8208;scission of the resulting alkoxy radical. The transient alkyl radical and enone acceptor generated in the scission event subsequently recombine via radical conjugate addition to deliver &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketone products. A variety of allylic alcohol substrates bearing alkyl and acyl migratory groups were successfully accommodated. Insights from mechanistic studies led to a modified reaction protocol that improves reaction performance for challenging substrates.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Biomimetic Aldol Reaction of Glycinates and Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20166-20172, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient biomimetic aldol reaction of glycinate and trifluoromethyl ketones was developed with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee) without protection of the active NH2 group. The reaction proceeds via a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis pathway similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinates represents an intriguing and straightforward strategy to make biologically significant chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid derivatives. But it is not easy to realize the transformation due to the disruption of the reactive NH2 group of glycinates. Inspired by the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine, we successfully developed an asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinate 5 and trifluoromethyl ketones 4 with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral N&#8208;methyl pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing chiral &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields (for the syn&#8208;diastereomers) with up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee under very mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine. Pyridoxal catalyst 7&#8201;a activates both reactants at the same time and brings them together in a specific spatial orientation, accounting for the high efficiency as well as excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Noncovalently Functionalized Commodity Polymers as Tailor&#8208;Made Additives for Stereoselective Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20243-20248, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy to fabricate &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives by attaching chiral small molecules onto achiral commodity polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions is developed. These supramolecular additives were used in the stereoselective crystallization of various racemates and yielded enantiopure crystals with opposite configurations to the chiral moieties.







Abstract
Stereoselective inhibition of the nucleation and crystal growth of one enantiomer aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient method to obtain enantiopure compounds. However, the conventional preparation of polymeric additives from chiral monomers are laborious and limited in structures, which impedes their rapid optimization and applicability. Herein, we report a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; strategy to facilitate synthesis by using commercially available achiral polymers as the platform to attach various chiral small molecules as the recognition side&#8208;chains through non&#8208;covalent interactions. A library of supramolecular polymers made up of two vinyl polymers and six small molecules were applied with seeds in the selective crystallization of seven racemates in different solvents. They showed good to excellent stereoselectivity in yielding crystals with high enantiomeric purities in conglomerates and racemic compound forming systems. This convenient, low&#8208;cost modular synthesis strategy of polymeric additives will allow for high&#8208;efficient, economical resolution of various racemates on different scales.

A high mobility organic lasing semiconductor of 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) with crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission is demonstrated. The light emitting transistor based on an individual LD&#8208;1 nanowire crystal gives typical electrically induced emission. This work provides a new concept for developing superior organic lasing semiconductors to advance research of electrically&#8208;driven ultrasmall integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.







Abstract
The development of high mobility organic laser semiconductors with strong emission is of great scientific and technical importance, but challenging. Herein, we present a high mobility organic laser semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) showing unique crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission guided by elaborately modulating its crystal growth process. The obtained one&#8208;dimensional nanowires of LD&#8208;1 show outstanding integrated properties including: high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching 80&#8201;%, high charge carrier mobility of 0.08&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Fabry&#8208;Perot lasing characters with a low threshold of 86&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high&#8208;quality factor of &#8776;2400. Furthermore, electrically induced emission was obtained from an individual LD&#8208;1 crystal nanowire&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting transistor due to the recombination of holes and electrons simultaneously injected into the nanowire, which provides a good platform for the study of electrically pumped organic lasers and other related ultrasmall integrated electrical&#8208;driven photonic devices.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Gradient Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel Membranes as High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20294-20300, September 6, 2021. </description>

Benefitting from an inherent high conductivity, excellent ion selectivity of 3D charged polymer networks, and a charge&#8208;induced ionic&#8208;diode gradient effect, all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel gradient membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion.







Abstract
Emerging asymmetric ionic membranes consisting of two different porous membranes show great superiority in harvesting clean and renewable osmotic energy. The main barriers constraining their applications are incompatible interfaces and a low interfacial ionic transport efficiency, which are detrimental to the long&#8208;term stability and improvement of the power density. Here, continuous&#8208;gradient all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. Besides an inherent high ion conductivity and excellent ion selectivity, the anti&#8208;swelling polyelectrolyte gradient membranes preserve the ionic diode effect of the asymmetric membranes to facilitate one&#8208;way ion diffusion but circumvent adverse interfacial effects. In consequence, they can present ultrahigh power densities of 7.87&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing seawater and river water, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.

In consequence, they can present ultrahigh power densities of 7.87&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; by mixing seawater and river water, far superior to state-of-the-art membranes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20196-20199, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a better understanding of the interaction between allosteric and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of Abl. Using a protease accessibility assay we developed, we determined the global conformation of Abl when bound to Abl inhibitors. We found that synergy between ATP&#8208;competitive and allosteric inhibitors of Abl required a &#8220;matched&#8221; kinase conformation.







Abstract
Allosteric inhibitors of Abl kinase are being explored in the clinic, often in combination with ATP&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl kinase. However, there are conflicting data on whether both ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and myristoyl&#8208;site allosteric inhibitors can simultaneously bind Abl kinase. Here, we determine whether there is synergy or antagonism between ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors of Abl. We observe that clinical ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors are not synergistic with allosteric ABL inhibitors, however, conformation&#8208;selective ATP&#8208;site inhibitors that modulate the global conformation of Abl can afford synergy. We demonstrate that kinase conformation is the key driver to simultaneously bind two compounds to Abl kinase. Finally, we explore the interaction of allosteric and conformation selective ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors in a series of biochemical and cellular assays.

         <title>Multistage Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Host&#8211;Guest Doping Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20259-20263, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of different conjugation degrees on the quantum yield and lifetime of room temperature phosphorescence in a host&#8211;guest system is discussed. Multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved by introducing a pyridine group into the guest molecule. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing.







Abstract
Compared with inorganic long&#8208;lasting luminescent materials, organic room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) ones show several advantages, such as flexibility, transparency, solubility and color adjustability. However, organic RTP materials close to commercialization are still to be developed. In this work, we developed a new host&#8211;guest doping system with stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics, in which triphenylphosphine oxide (OPph3) acted host and benzo(dibenzo)phenothiazine dioxide derivatives as guests. Turn&#8208;on RTP effect was realized by mixing them together through co&#8208;crystallization or grinding, in which the efficient energy transfer from host to guest and the strong intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the guest have played significant role. Further on, multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved via introducing pyridine group into the guest molecule. In addition, the anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized for these materials through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing, which brings RTP materials closer to commercialization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;phase reactions play an important role in the conversion of methane under non&#8208;oxidative conditions into olefins and aromatics over iron&#8208;modified silica catalysts. Herein, we used operando photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to disentangle the elusive C2+  radical intermediates participating in the complex reaction network. Our experiments pinpointed different C2&#8208;C5  radical species that allow for a stepwise growth of the hydrocarbon chains. Herein, propargyl radicals (H2C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;H) are identified as essential precursors for the formation of aromatics, which contribute with the formation of heavier hydrocarbon products via hydrogen abstraction &#8208; acetylene addition routes (HACA mechanism). These results provide comprehensive mechanistic insights that are relevant for development of methane valorization processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the utility of Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) for background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized biomolecules. We performed hyperpolarization of ~0.3 M ethyl acetate via pairwise parahydrogen addition to vinyl acetate. Proton NMR signal with signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio exceeding 100,000 was detected without radio&#8208;frequency excitation at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 1.4 T using a standard (non&#8208;cryogenic) inductive detector with quality factor of Q = 68. No proton background signal was observed from protonated solvent (methanol) or other added co&#8208;solvents such as ethanol, water or bovine serum. Moreover, we demonstrate RASER detection without radio&#8208;frequency excitation of a bolus of hyperpolarized contrast agent in biological fluid.&#160; Completely background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized contrast agents in biological media paves the way to new applications in the areas of high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and in vivo spectroscopy and imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metastable metal hydrides such as AlH  3  have many attractive features as hydrogen storage media, but generally require complex reaction schemes for regeneration following H  2  release. Here, we demonstrate that the highly unfavorable thermodynamics of direct aluminum hydrogenation can be overcome by stabilizing alane within a nanoporous bipyridine&#8208;functionalized Covalent Triazine Framework (AlH  3  @CTF&#8208;bipyridine). This material and the counterpart AlH  3  @CTF&#8208;biphenyl rapidly desorb H  2  between 95 and 154 &#176;C, with desorption complete at 250 &#176;C. Sieverts measurements,  27  Al MAS NMR and  27  Al{  1  H} REDOR experiments, and computational spectroscopy reveal that AlH  3  @CTF&#8208;bipyridine dehydrogenation is reversible at 60 &#176;C under 700 bar hydrogen, &gt;10 times lower pressure than that required to hydrogenate bulk aluminum. DFT calculations and EPR measurements support an unconventional mechanism whereby strong AlH  3  binding to bipyridine results in single&#8208;electron transfer to form AlH  2  (AlH  3  )  n  clusters. The resulting size&#8208;dependent charge redistribution alters the dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation thermochemistry, suggesting a novel strategy to enable reversibility in high&#8208;capacity metal hydrides.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Grown Chloride Perovskite Crystal of Red Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide&#8208;based afterglow materials were usually produced through high&#8208;temperature treatment (&gt; 1000 &#176;C), which brought both considerable energy consumption and safety risk to manufacturer. Here, we report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs  2  Na  x  Ag  1&#8208;x  InCl  6  :y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180 &#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na  +  and Mn  2+  , the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (~ 100%) and a long duration time (&gt; 5400 s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals. The energy transfer (ET) process between self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) and activators was investigated through time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, which suggested an ET efficiency up to 41%. Importantly, the nominal concentration of dopants, especially in the case of Na  +  , was found a useful tool to control both energy level and number distribution of traps. Cryogenic afterglow measurements suggested that the afterglow phenomenon was likely governed by thermal&#8208;activated exciton diffusion and electron tunneling process. Our work provided a convenient access to a new class of afterglow materials with low lattice energy, representing a paradigm for low&#8208;temperature synthesis of afterglow crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium Nitride Nanozyme for pH&#8208;Responsive and Irradiation Enhanced Cascade Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozyme&#8208;based tumor catalytic therapy is an emerging therapeutic method with high reactivity in response to tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome the current limitations of deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes, we studied the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on non&#8208;metallic atom doping and irradiation. Except for the chemical state of transition metal element, we demonstrated that nitrogen doping significantly enhanced the peroxidase (POD) activity of Ti&#8208;based nanozymes experimentally and theoretically for the first time. Based on the excellent NIR adsorption induced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and photothermal effect, the enzymatic activity of TiN NPs was further improved under NIR laser irradiation. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and irradiation mediated cascade nanocatalyst (TLGp) is presented by using TiN NPs encapsulated liposomes linked with pH&#8208;responsive PEG&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive GOx&#8208;mediated H  2  O  2  self&#8208;supply, nitrogen&#8208;doping and irradiation enhanced enzymatic activity of TiN NPs, and mild&#8208;photothermal therapy, endow TLGp effective tumor inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Metathesis Cascade&#8208;Triggered Depolymerization of Enyne Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) capable of metathesis cascade&#8208;triggered depolymerization is reported. Studies on model compounds established 1,6&#8208;enyne structures for efficient metathesis cascade reactions. SIPs incorporating the optimized 1,6&#8208;enyne motif were prepared via both polycondensation and iterative exponential growth approaches. These SIPs demonstrated excellent stability in strong acid,&amp;nbsp;base, nucleophiles, or at elevated temperatures, and can undergo efficient and complete depolymerization once triggered by a metathesis catalyst. Further studies revealed that introducing a terminal alkene to the chain end of the enyne SIPs improved the depolymerization efficiency, and established their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Enhanced Antimicrobial Activity of Polymers Containing an Embedded Photosensitiser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work presents the synthesis of a novel photosensitive acrylate monomer for use as both a self&#8208;catalyst in the photoinduced electron/energy transfer &#8211; reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation process and a photosensitiser (PS) for antibacterial applications. A range of hydrophilic, cationic, and antimicrobial formulations are explored to compare the antibacterial effects between charged and non&#8208;charged polymers. Covalent attachment of catalyst to well&#8208;defined linear polymer chains has no effect on polymerisation control, or singlet oxygen generation. The addition of PS to polymers provides activity against gram&#8208;positive  S. aureus  for all polymer formulations, resulting in up to a 99.99999% killing efficacy in 30 min. Of note is that antimicrobial peptide mimetic polymers previously active against  P. aeruginosa  , but not  S. aureus  , gain significant bactericidal activity against  S. aureus  through the inclusion of PS groups, with 99.998% killing efficiency after 30 min incubation with light. In essence, a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity is achieved using two distinct mechanisms of bactericidal activity via the incorporation of a photosensitiser monomer into an antimicrobial polymer.</dc:description>

Under net reductive conditions using commercial Hantzsch ester, the &#945;&#8208;amino radical species underwent a single stereoselective cyclisation to give trans&#8208;configured amino&#8208;indane structures in good yield, whereas using a substituted Hantzsch ester as a milder reductant afforded cis&#8208;fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline frameworks, resulting from two consecutive radical cyclisations. Judicious choice of the reaction conditions allowed libraries of both single and dual cyclisation products to be synthesised with high selectivity, notable predictability, and good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.

         <title>Allosteric Switching of Calmodulin in a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) Nanopore&#8208;Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments concerning large protein nanopores suggest a new approach to structure profiling of native folded proteins. In this work, the large vestibule of Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) and calmodulin (CaM), a Ca2+&#8208;binding protein were used in the direct observation of the protein structure. Three conformers including the Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound and target peptide&#8208;bound states of CaM were unambiguously distinguished. A disease related mutant, CaM D129G was also discriminated by MspA, revealing how a single amino acid replacement can interfere with the Ca2+ binding capacity of the whole protein. The binding capacity and aggregation effect of CaM induced by different ions (Mg2+/Sr2+/Ba2+/Ca2+/Pb2+/Tb3+) were also investigated and the stability of MspA in extreme conditions was evaluated. This work demonstrates the most systematic single molecule investigation of different allosteric conformers of CaM, acknowledging the high sensing resolution offered by the MspA nanopore trap.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) moieties is promising for efficient electrochemical CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, it is essential but still challenging to steer the coordination environment of Ni centers for promoting the CO formation kinetics. Here, we show a strategy by introducing alien sulfur atoms to tune the local electronic density of unsaturated NiN  2  species. A coordinated structure evolution is detected and S vacancies are generated at high overpotentials, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The sulfur&#8208;dopants enhance CO selectivity and activity over normal unsaturated NiN  2  structure, reaching a high CO Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a large CO current density of 40.3 mA cm  &#8208;2  in a H&#8208;cell at &#8208;0.8 V and &#8208;0.9 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal both doped S atoms and evolved S vacancies in the NiN  2  coordination environment contribute to the reduced energy barriers for CO  2  electroreduction to CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of ammonia to hydrazine induced by high frequency ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazine is a chemical of outmost importance in our society, either for organic synthesis or energy purpose. The direct conversion of NH  3  to hydrazine is highly appealing but it remains a very difficult task because the degradation of hydrazine is thermodynamically more feasible than the cleavage of the N&#8208;H bond of NH  3  . As a result, any catalyst capable of activating NH  3  will thus unavoidably decompose N  2  H  4  . Here we show that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous NH  3  at a high frequency, act as micro&#8208;reactors to activate and convert NH  3  to NH species, without assistance of any catalyst, yielding hydrazine at the bubble&#8208;liquid interface. The compartmentation of  in situ  produced hydrazine in the bulk solution, which is maintained close to 30&#176;C, advantageously prevents its thermal degradation, a recurrent problem faced by previous technologies. This work also points towards a path to scavenge &#8226;OH radicals by adjusting the NH  3  concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Design and Crystal Structure of a Highly Efficient Benzoylecgonine Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for cocaine&#8208;induced long&#8208;term toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. We computationally identified, re&#8208;designed, and crystallized a novel BZEase. The obtained BZEase mutant shows a 427&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency toward BZE compared to WT BZEase. In vivo tests prove that the BZEase mutant is a promising treatment for BZE detoxification.







Abstract
Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for the long&#8208;term cocaine&#8208;induced toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. BZE is also the main contaminant following cocaine consumption. Here, we identified the bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) as a BZE&#8208;metabolizing enzyme (BZEase), which can degrade BZE into biological inactive metabolites (ecgonine and benzoic acid). CocE was redesigned by a reactant&#8208;state&#8208;based enzyme design theory. An encouraging mutant denoted as BZEase2, presented a &gt;400&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency against BZE compared with wild&#8208;type (WT) CocE. In vivo, a single dose of BZEase2 (1&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme has the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was also determined.

         <title>Saucer[n]arenes: Synthesis, Structure, Complexation, and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes named saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) are synthesized by one&#8208;pot and templated methods. Saucer[n]arenes show strong fluorescence properties and form 1:1 complexes with various ammonium salts. Moreover, the chiral guests can induce the chirality of dynamically racemic saucer[n]arenes in the host&#8211;guest systems, which provides a new way to construct CPL organic materials.







Abstract
Macrocycles denoted as saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) were easily synthesized by the one&#8208;pot condensation of 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene (2,7&#8208;DMN) and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TFA or catalytic BF3&#8901;OEt2. With 1,1&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ium as the template, saucer[4]arene was selectively obtained. Crystal structures show that saucer[n]arenes are all composed of 2,7&#8208;DMN moiety bridged by the methylene groups at 1,6&#8208;positions: all of the 7&#8208;methoxy groups lie on one face, and all of the 2&#8208;methoxy groups lie on the other. Saucer[n]arenes exhibit strong fluorescence properties with the quantum yields of 19.6&#8201;% and 23.4&#8201;%. They form 1:1 complexes with ammonium salts in both solution and solid state (association constant up to 105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CDCl3). Chiral quaternary ammonium salts can induce the chirality of the dynamically racemic inherently chiral saucer[n]arenes in solution, and thus show mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Enantiopure Pyrrolidines by C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple hydrocarbons such as alkanes are shown to be useful building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of heterocycles. They are converted in only two steps to pyrrolidines by application of stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reactions. Symmetrical and non&#8208;symmetrical enantiopure 2,5&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolidines are isolated in good yields.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure pyrrolidines is reported via a streamlined strategy relying on two sequential C&#8722;H functionalizations of simple hydrocarbons. The first step is a regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalytic nitrene C&#8722;H insertion. Then, a subsequent diastereoselective cyclization involving a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a N&#8208;centered radical leads to the formation of pyrrolidines that can then be converted to their free NH&#8208;derivatives.

         <title>Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Methanol through Atomically Dispersed Sn Coupled with Defective CuO Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared atomically dispersed Sn catalysts on defective CuO for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. The Faradaic efficiency of methanol could reach 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The catalyst was beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The *CO was then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.







Abstract
Using renewable electricity to drive CO2 electroreduction is an attractive way to achieve carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle and produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. As an important platform molecule and clean fuel, methanol requires 6&#8208;electron transfer in the process of CO2 reduction. Currently, CO2 electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity. Herein, we report the first work to design atomically dispersed Sn site anchored on defective CuO catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. It exhibits high methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability in a H&#8208;cell, which is the highest FE(methanol) with such high current density compared with the results reported to date. The atomic Sn site, adjacent oxygen vacancy and CuO support cooperate very well, leading to higher double&#8208;layer capacitance, larger CO2 adsorption capacity and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Operando experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the catalyst is beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The obtained key intermediate *CO is then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nanobodies Allow Dual&#8208;Color Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy in Untransfected Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;permeable nanobodies equipped with a fluorophore and a photostabilizer are introduced as powerful tools for live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By using intramolecular photostabilization dynamic processes can be monitored in untransfected living cells.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy in living cells can be restricted by the availability of small molecule probes, which only exist against few targets and genetically encoded tags. Here, we expand the applicability of live&#8208;cell STED by engineering cell&#8208;permeable and highly fluorescent nanobodies as intracellular targeting agents. To ensure bright fluorescent signals at low concentrations we used the concept of intramolecular photostabilization by ligating a fluorophore along with the photostabilizer trolox to the nanobody using expressed protein ligation (EPL). Furthermore, these semi&#8208;synthetic nanobodies are equipped with a cleavable cell&#8208;penetrating peptide for efficient cellular entry, which enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP and mCherry, as well as two endogenous targets, nuclear lamins and the DNA replication and repair protein PCNA. We monitored cell division and DNA replication via confocal and STED microscopy thus demonstrating the utility of these new intracellular tools for functional analysis.

         <title>Double proton transfer across a table: theformic acid dimer &#8211; fluorobenzene complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton transfer proceeding via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon.Here we report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in thecomplex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The assignment of the spectrumindicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#8208; stacked structure. Each rotationaltransition of the parent isotopologue exhibits a splitting feature. Isotopic substitution experimentsreveal that the spectral splitting results from double&#8208;proton transfer tunnelingin the formic acid dimer. The results demonstrate that the presence of fluorobenzene asa neighboring molecule does not quench the double proton transfer in the formic aciddimer but decreases its tunneling splitting from 341(3) MHz to 267.608(1) MHz. Thetheoretical calculations suggest that the presence of the weakly bounded fluorobenzenedoes not influence the activation energy of the proton transfer. The observed decrease ofthe tunneling rate in the complex with respect to the formic acid dimer is explained usingthe concept of the molecular environment reorganization energy (Marcus energy).The fluorobenzene is reoriented with respect to the formic acid dimer during the courseof the reaction, which slows down the proton transfer motion.</dc:description>

         <title>Can One Measure Resonance Raman Optical Activity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Measured resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) often did not agree with theoretical predictions. We uncover a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, that explains some of these inconsistencies. This combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman has also immense potential as a sensitive technique for applications in chemistry or biology.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) is commonly measured as the difference in intensity of Raman scattered right and left circularly polarized light, IR&#8722;IL, when a randomly polarized light is in resonance with a chiral molecule. Strong and sometimes mono&#8208;signate experimental RROA spectra of several chiral solutes were reported previously, although their signs and relative intensities could not be reproduced theoretically. By examining multiple light&#8208;matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite&#8208;lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by eCP&#8208;Raman, without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of eCP&#8208;Raman spectroscopy and for extracting true RROA experimentally.

         <title>Electrochemical Potential&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Throughput Molecular Electronic and Spintronic Devices: From Molecules to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review describes recent advances in the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven preparation of nanometric molecular films of various molecules on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena. We hope to encourage the design of a facile and efficient route for molecular optoelectronic and flexible electronic applications.







Abstract
Molecules are fascinating candidates for constructing tunable and electrically conducting devices by the assembly of either a single molecule or an ensemble of molecules between two electrical contacts followed by current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) analysis, which is often termed &#8220;molecular electronics&#8221;. Recently, there has been also an upsurge of interest in spin&#8208;based electronics or spintronics across the molecules, which offer additional scope to create ultrafast responsive devices with less power consumption and lower heat generation using the intrinsic spin property rather than electronic charge. Researchers have been exploring this idea of utilizing organic molecules, organometallics, coordination complexes, polymers, and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, oligopeptides, DNA) in integrating molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Although several methods exist to prepare molecular thin&#8208;films on suitable electrodes, the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven technique has emerged as highly efficient. In this Review we describe recent advances in the electrochemical potential driven growth of nanometric various molecular films on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena.

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Induced Defects in MOF&#8208;Derived Single Cobalt Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylation gives Co&#8208;N4 catalysts with rich defects for use in the oxygen reduction reaction. The defect near the Co&#8208;N4 site weakens the adsorption free energy of OOH on the cobalt active center, which significantly improves the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Co&#8208;N4 site and leads to a remarkable turnover frequency.







Abstract
Developing transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we report a decarboxylation&#8208;induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed&#8208;linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas&#8208;transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF&#8208;8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;900), Co@DMOF&#8208;900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double&#8208;layer capacitance show better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.

         <title>Reversible and Irreversible [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions of Heteroallenes to a Gallaphosphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene 1 with carbodiimides and isocyanates yield four&#8208;membered metallaheterocyles 2&#8211;6. The carbodiimide cycloadditions are fully reversible at elevated temperature, as was also observed in reactions of compounds 4&#8211;6 with CO2.







Abstract
[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)]2) with carbodiimides [C(NR)2; R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy] and isocyanates [RNCO; R=Et, i&#8208;Pr, Cy] yielded four&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(X)NR]GaL (X=NR, R=i&#8208;Pr 2, Cy 3; X=O, R=Et 4, i&#8208;Pr 5, Cy 6). Compounds 4&#8211;6 reversibly react with CO2 via [2+2] cycloaddition at ambient temperature to the six&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(O)O]&#8208;&#956;&#8208;C(O)N(R)GaL (R=Et 7, i&#8208;Pr 8, Cy 9). Compounds 2&#8211;9 were characterized by IR and heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, while quantum chemical calculations provided a deeper understanding on the energetics of the reactions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Construction of Chiral Azepine Skeleton Bearing Multiple&#8208;Stereogenic Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution was developed. With this methodology, four types of stereogenic elements including chiral nitrogen center, C&#8722;N axial chirality, C&#8722;C axial chirality and conformational behavior of the seven&#8208;membered ring were stereoselectively constructed.







Abstract
Enantioselective construction of molecules bearing multiple stereogenic elements is increasingly related to the synthesis of enantiopure natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. However, atom&#8208;economical and enantioselective approaches to install multiple stereogenic elements in a small molecular template by limited chemical transformation remain challenging. We describe an organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules bearing four types of stereogenic elements in fused azepines via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution. This method was proved robust with a wide range of substrate scope (46&#8211;92&#8201;% yield), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) and enantioselectivity achieved (up to 97&#8201;% ee). Optical properties and Ru3+&#8208;induced fluorescence responses of these compounds suggest their potential applications in optoelectronic materials and heavy metal ion detection.

         <title>Charge Transfer from Donor to Acceptor in Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Enhanced Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy to trigger charge transfer for improving photosensitization is the covalent modification of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Charge transfer from the PAH donor to the Bodipy acceptor in CMPs can facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8211;hole separation, leading to excellent performance for both energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer reactions.







Abstract
Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron&#8208;transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP&#8208;1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP&#8208;2&#8211;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8208;hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP&#8208;2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92&#8201;% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP&#8208;1 (32&#8201;%). Experiments and theory calculations demonstrate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of these CMPs, opening a new horizon for developing HAF heterogeneous photosensitizers with highly efficient sensitizing activity by rational structure regulation at a molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron-transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy-atom-free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP-1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP-2&#8211;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron-hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy-/electron-transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP-2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92&#8201;% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP-1 (32&#8201;%).

         <title>Implanting Numerous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in a Cu&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Nanosheet to Boost CH4 Selectivity in Neutral&#8208;Media CO2 Electroreduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based large&#8208;scale, ultrathin nanosheet with numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks was developed for the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 under neutral conditions. This catalyst exhibits a superior FE
 of 70&#8201;% with a high current density (&#8722;183.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V under rarely reported neutral conditions and maintains FE
&gt;51&#8201;% over a wide potential range (&#8722;1.5 to &#8722;1.7&#8197;V) in a flow cell.







Abstract
The exploration of novel systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the production of hydrocarbons like CH4 remains a giant challenge. Well&#8208;designed electrocatalysts with advantages like proton generation/transferring and intermediate&#8208;fixating for efficient CO2RR are much preferred yet largely unexplored. In this work, a kind of Cu&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based large&#8208;scale (&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin nanosheet (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) has been successfully applied in electrochemical CO2RR. It exhibits a superior FE
 of 70&#8201;% with a high current density (&#8722;183.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V under rarely reported neutral conditions and maintains FE
&gt;51&#8201;% over a wide potential range (&#8722;1.5 to &#8722;1.7&#8197;V) in a flow cell. The high performance can be attributed to the construction of numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through the integration of diaminotriazine with Cu&#8208;porphyrin, which is beneficial for proton migration and intermediate stabilization, as supported by DFT calculations. This work paves a new way in exploring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based materials as efficient CO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Grotthuss Proton&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly crystalline, robust covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were fabricated with intrinsic Grotthuss proton conductivity. The assembled covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based pseudocapacitors displayed both high energy density and high power density that surpassed that of all other reported COF&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the synthesis of two highly crystalline, robust, hydrophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that display intrinsic proton conduction by the Grotthuss mechanism. The enriched redox&#8208;active azo groups in the COFs can undergo a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making the COFs ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in situ hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three&#8208;electrode specific capacitance of 440&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, among the highest for COF&#8208;based supercapacitors, and can retain 90&#8201;% capacitance even after 10&#8201;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. This is the first example using Grotthuss proton&#8208;conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two&#8208;electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a maximum power density of 42&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, surpassing that of all reported COF&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Glycine from Oxalic Acid and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By electrochemical method, stable oxalic acid and nitrate substrates were coupled into an amino acid, glycine. Insertion of electrons resulted in their conversion into nucleophile and electrophile, respectively, which led to C=N bond formation between them, as well as the conversion of the reversible C=N double bond to a stable C&#8722;N single bond.







Abstract
In manufacturing C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing compounds, it is an important challenge to alternate the conventional methodologies that utilize reactive substrates, toxic reagents, and organic solvents. In this study, we developed an electrochemical method to synthesize a C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing molecule avoiding the use of cyanides and amines by harnessing nitrate (NO3&#8722;) as a nitrogen source in an aqueous electrolyte. In addition, we utilized oxalic acid as a carbon source, which can be obtained from electrochemical conversion of CO2. Thus, our approach can provide a route for the utilization of anthropogenic CO2 and nitrate wastes, which cause serious environmental problems including global warming and eutrophication. Interestingly, the coreduction of oxalic acid and nitrate generated reactive intermediates, which led to C&#8722;N bond formation followed by further reduction to an amino acid, namely, glycine. By carefully controlling this multireduction process with a fabricated Cu&#8211;Hg electrode, we demonstrated the efficient production of glycine with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of up to 43.1&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl (current density&#8776;90&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Heterostructured SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 with High&#8208;Valence Mn3+/4+ for Improved Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An epitaxially grown SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 heterostructure has been developed for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the effect of interfacial chemistry on ORR performance, the formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial in promoting the positive shift of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and improving catalytic activity.







Abstract
Heterostructured catalysts show outstanding performance in electrochemical reactions owing to their beneficial interfacial properties. However, the rational design of heterostructured catalysts with the desired interfacial properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics is challenging. Herein, we developed a SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 (SMOx&#8208;SMO) heterostructure through epitaxial growth, which demonstrated excellent electrocatalyst performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial for promoting a positive shift in the position of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and resulting in improved catalytic activity. When SMOx&#8208;SMO was applied as an air&#8208;electrode catalyst in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, a high output voltage and power density was achieved, with performance comparable to a battery prepared with Pt/C&#8208;IrO2 air&#8208;electrode catalysts, albeit with much better cycling stability.

The permeation of ZnIIPPIX functionalized nanowires into the malignant TNBC cells leads to a selective cytotoxicity and an effective photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) treatment toward cancer cells.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides powerful tools for developing cancer theranostics. Here we introduce the autonomous surface&#8208;nucleolin&#8208;guided HCR that leads to the polymerization of G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, in which the ZnII&#8208;protoporphyrin IX is intercalated. We demonstrate that MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 (Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells, TNBC) with overexpressed surface nucleolin were able to induce HCR leading to the formation of the ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, while the M10 epithelial breast cells served as control. The ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded nanowires allow the selective imaging of TNBC, and their permeation into the TNBC leads to selective cytotoxicity and guided photodynamic therapy toward the cancer cells due to structural perturbation of the membranes. The aptamer&#8208;guided HCR&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains may serve as a versatile tool to target TNBC featuring poor prognosis and high pathological risk of recurrence, thus offering a promising theranostic platform.

         <title>Revealing Ammonia Quantification Minefield in Photo/Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The analytical methods for the detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2&#8197;ppm in photo/electrocatalytic N2 fixation are evaluated rigorously, reliably, and insightfully. The low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification minefield was indicated and a rigorous ammonia detection flowchart as well as another reference standard to achieve a more accurate and responsible ammonia detection in photo/electrocatalysis was concluded.







Abstract
Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis has recently developed fast while the ammonia yields over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH3 brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error&#8208;prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorogenic Probe for Monitoring Ethylene in Living Cells and Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic probes were developed for rapid (&lt;2&#8197;min), highly selective, and quantitative detection of ethylene. Among the coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes developed, CEP&#8208;1 has the capacity to detect endogenous ethylene gas in living cells and plants.







Abstract
Ethylene (ET) is an important gaseous plant hormone. It is highly desirable to develop fluorescent probes for monitoring ethylene in living cells. We report an efficient RhIII&#8208;catalysed coupling of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides to ethylene in the presence of an alcohol. The newly discovered coupling reaction exhibited a wide scope of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides and excellent regioselectivity. We successfully developed three fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes (CEPs) using this strategy for the selective and quantitative detection of ethylene. CEP&#8208;1 exhibited the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of ethylene at 52&#8197;ppb in air. Furthermore, CEP&#8208;1 was successfully applied for imaging in living CHO&#8208;K1 cells and for monitoring endogenous&#8208;induced changes in ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana plants. These results indicate that CEP&#8208;1 has great potential to illuminate the spatiotemporal regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction in living biological systems.

         <title>Enabling the Use of Alkyl Thianthrenium Salts in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of thianthrenium salts have been developed that can undergo C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage and be used as reliable alkyl reagents. This ability has been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira and Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Alkyl groups are one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Here, a a series of thianthrenium salts have been synthesized that act as reliable alkylation reagents and readily engage in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira reactions to build C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under mild photochemical conditions. Diverse alkyl thianthrenium salts, including methyl and disubstituted thianthrenium salts, are employed with great functional breadth, since sensitive Cl, Br, and I atoms, which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches, are compatible. The generality of the developed alkyl reagents has also been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Kumada reactions.

         <title>Smart 131I&#8208;Labeled Self&#8208;Illuminating Photosensitizers for Deep Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel responsive nanoparticles based on Cerenkov resonance energy transfer are suitable for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of deep tumors without the need for exogenous light. The nanoparticles have low toxicity and few harmful side effects on normal tissue.







Abstract
Stimulating photosensitizers (PS) by Cerenkov radiation (CR) can overcome the light penetration limitation in traditional photodynamic therapy. However, separate injection of radiopharmaceuticals and PS cannot guarantee their efficient interaction in tumor areas, while co&#8208;delivery of radionuclides and PS face the problem of nonnegligible phototoxicity in normal tissues. Here, we describe a 131I&#8208;labeled smart photosensitizer, composed of pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (photosensitizer), a diisopropylamino group (pH&#8208;sensitive group), an 131I&#8208;labeled tyrosine group (CR donor), and polyethylene glycol, which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (131I&#8208;sPS NPs). The 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed low phototoxicity in normal tissues due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, but could self&#8208;produce reactive oxygen species in tumor sites upon disassembly. Upon intravenous injection, 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed great tumor inhibition capability in subcutaneous 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing Balb/c mice and orthotopic VX2 liver tumor bearing rabbits. We believed 131I&#8208;sPS NPs could expand the application of CR and provide an effective strategy for deep tumor theranostics.

         <title>Exporting Metal&#8208;Carbene Chemistry to Live Mammalian Cells: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intracellular Synthesis of Quinoxalines Enabled by N&#8722;H Carbene Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that catalytic processes involving metal&#8211;carbene intermediates can be exported to the crowded magma of a live mammalian cell. In particular, reactions involving copper carbenes can be used for the synthesis of fluorescent cyclic products in cellular media, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8722;H carbene insertion. The method also allows the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions.







Abstract
Implementing catalytic organometallic transformations in living settings can offer unprecedented opportunities in chemical biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the number of biocompatible reactions so far discovered is very limited, and essentially restricted to uncaging processes. Here, we demonstrate the viability of performing metal carbene transfer reactions in live mammalian cells. In particular, we show that copper (II) catalysts can promote the intracellular annulation of alpha&#8208;keto diazocarbenes with ortho&#8208;amino arylamines, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8208;H carbene insertion. The potential of this transformation is underscored by the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions, and by demonstrating cell selective biological responses using targeted copper catalysts.

     alt="Exporting Metal-Carbene Chemistry to Live Mammalian Cells: Copper-Catalyzed Intracellular Synthesis of Quinoxalines Enabled by N&#8722;H Carbene Insertions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates that catalytic processes involving metal&#8211;carbene intermediates can be exported to the crowded magma of a live mammalian cell. In particular, reactions involving copper carbenes can be used for the synthesis of fluorescent cyclic products in cellular media, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8722;H carbene insertion. The method also allows the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing catalytic organometallic transformations in living settings can offer unprecedented opportunities in chemical biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the number of biocompatible reactions so far discovered is very limited, and essentially restricted to uncaging processes. Here, we demonstrate the viability of performing metal carbene transfer reactions in live mammalian cells. In particular, we show that copper (II) catalysts can promote the intracellular annulation of alpha-keto diazocarbenes with ortho-amino arylamines, in a process that is initiated by an N-H carbene insertion. The potential of this transformation is underscored by the &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions, and by demonstrating cell selective biological responses using targeted copper catalysts. Considering the wide reactivity spectrum of metal carbenes, this work opens the door to significantly expanding the repertoire of life-compatible abiotic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intrinsic ORR Activity Enhancement of Pt Atomic Sites by Engineering the d&#8208;Band Center via Local Coordination Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;coordinated atomic Pt&#8208;Nx sites are theoretically predicted and experimentally realized, offering enhanced kinetics for four&#8208;electron electrochemical oxygen reduction. Exceptional activity is attributed to the tuning of the d&#8208;band electron center via local coordination asymmetry. This chemistry provides an effective guideline for atomic Pt catalysts in batteries and fuel cells.







Abstract
A considerable amount of platinum (Pt) is required to ensure an adequate rate for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Thus, the implementation of atomic Pt catalysts holds promise for minimizing the Pt content. In this contribution, atomic Pt sites with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co&#8208;coordination on a carbon matrix (PtNPC) are conceptually predicted and experimentally developed to alter the d&#8208;band center of Pt, thereby promoting the intrinsic ORR activity. PtNPC with a record&#8208;low Pt content (&#8776;0.026&#8197;wt&#8201;%) consequently shows a benchmark&#8208;comparable activity for ORR with an onset of 1.0 VRHE and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 VRHE. It also features a high stability in 15&#8201;000&#8208;cycle tests and a superior turnover frequency of 6.80&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.9 VRHE. Damjanovic kinetics analysis reveals a tuned ORR kinetics of PtNPC from a mixed 2/4&#8208;electron to a predominately 4&#8208;electron route. It is discovered that coordinated P species significantly shifts d&#8208;band center of Pt atoms, accounting for the exceptional performance of PtNPC.

         <title>Quick and Easy Method to Dramatically Improve the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of an Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical CO2 reduction activity of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, is dramatically enhanced by a simple one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction. The resulting complex, FeTPP, shows improved solubility. Its turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile is 7.3&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of relevant molecular catalysts.







Abstract
The development of artificial molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction is the key to solving energy and environmental problems. Although chemical modifications can generally improve the catalytic activity of this class of compounds, they often require complicated synthetic procedures. Here, we report a simple procedure that dramatically enhances electrochemical CO2 reduction activity. A one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction increased the solubility of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, in a variety of solvents, allowing the investigation of its catalytic performance under various conditions. Surprisingly, the turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) reached 7&#8201;300&#8201;000&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of current best&#8208;in&#8208;class molecular catalysts. This excellent catalytic activity originates from the unique reaction between the generated FeI species and CO2 in MeCN during catalysis. The present study offers a &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; method for obtaining an efficient catalytic system for electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Chemical Genetics Reveals a Role of Squalene Synthase in TGF&#946; Signaling and Cardiomyogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis. Chemical genetics of KY02111 identified squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling and recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes an inherited heart disease.







Abstract
KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis of the mesoderm cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, yet its molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. The present study resolves the initially perplexing effects of KY02111 on Wnt signaling and subsequently identifies squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111 and its optimized version, KY&#8208;I. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946; signaling, but not Wnt signaling, and thereby recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited heart disease that involves a substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role of SQS in TGF&#946; signaling and cardiomyogenesis. KY02111 may find its use in ARVC modeling as well as serve as a chemical tool for studying TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Formation of Polymer Janus Discs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs were fabricated from ABC triblock terpolymers through cross&#8208;linking and disassembly of prolate ellipsoidal particles. By varying the pore diameter of a Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane, the size of prolate ellipsoidal particles and the corresponding Janus discs can be well controlled.







Abstract
A straightforward method is presented for the preparation of nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs with controlled shape, size, and aspect ratio. The method relies on cross&#8208;linkable ABC triblock terpolymers and involves first the preparation of prolate ellipsoidal microparticles by combining Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane emulsification with evaporation&#8208;induced confinement assembly (EICA). By varying the pore diameter of the SPG membrane, we produce Janus discs with controlled size distributions centered around hundreds of nanometers to several microns. We further transferred the discs to water by mild sulfonation of PS to polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) and verified the Janus character by subsequent labelling with cationic nanoparticles. Finally, we show that the sulfonated Janus discs are amphiphilic and can be used as efficient colloidal stabilizers for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) emulsions.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;dominated stable N97 respirators for airborne virus capture based on nanofibrous membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The worldwide COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has led to an extensive attention on the usage of N95&#8208;grade face respirators(N95 FFRs), which are dominated by external electrostatic charged polypropylene meltblown fabrics. However, their longevity and reusability are limited by consecutive donning and disinfection treatments. Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin&#8208;film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long&#8208;lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42 Pa  &#8208;1  (filtration efficiency: over 97%; pressure drop: around 10 Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10&#8208;0.41 Pa  &#8208;1  ) tested with a flow rate of 5 L/min and the 0.26 &#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.</dc:description>

Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin-film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long-lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42 Pa  -1  (filtration efficiency: over 97%; pressure drop: around 10 Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10-0.41 Pa  -1  ) tested with a flow rate of 5 L/min and the 0.26 &#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biochemistry&#8208;guided prediction of the absolute configuration of fungal reduced polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly reducing polyketide synthases (HR&#8208;PKSs) produce structurally diverse polyketides (PKs). The PK diversity is constructed by a variety of factors, including the b&#8208;keto processing, chain length, methylation pattern, and relative and absolute configurations of the substituents. In this study, we examined the stereochemical course of the PK processing for the synthesis of polyhydroxy PKs such as phialotides, phomenoic acid, and ACR&#8208;toxin. Heterologous expression of a HR&#8208;PKS gene, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase gene, and a truncated non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase gene resulted in the formation of a linear PK with multiple stereogenic centers. The absolute configurations of the stereogenic centers were determined by chemical degradation followed by comparison of the degradation products with synthetic standards. A stereochemical rule was proposed to explain the absolute configurations of other reduced PKs and highlights an error in the absolute configurations of a reported structure. The present work demonstrates that focused functional analysis of functionally related HR&#8208;PKSs leads to a better understanding of the stereochemical course.</dc:description>

         <title>Subsurface Carbon&#8208;Induced Local Charge of Copper for On&#8208;Surface Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal carbides have sparked unprecedented enthusiasm as high&#8208;performance catalysts in recent years. Still, the catalytic properties of copper (Cu) carbide remain unexplored. By introducing subsurface carbon (C) to Cu(111), displacement reaction of proton in carboxyl acid group with single Cu atom is demonstrated at the atomic scale and room temperature. Its occurrence is attributed to the C&#8208;doping induced local charge of surface Cu atoms (up to +0.30 e/atom), which accelerates the rate of on&#8208;surface deprotonation via reduction of the corresponding energy barrier, thus enabling the instant displacement of a proton with a Cu atom when the molecules land on the surface. Such well&#8208;defined and robust Cu  d+  surface based on the subsurface C doping offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Access to Dihydroquinoxalinones via Formal &#945;&#8208;Halo Acyl Halide Synthon in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A first enantioselective one&#8208;pot catalytic strategy to dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring novel 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano enantioenriched epoxides as masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthon, followed by a domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC), is documented. A popular quinine&#8208;derived urea served as the catalyst in two, out of the three steps performed in the same solvent, using commercially available aldehydes, (phenylsulfonyl)acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide and 1,2&#8208;phenylendiamines. Medicinally relevant 3&#8208;aryl/alkyl substituted heterocycles are isolated in generally good to high overall yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). A rare example of excellent reusability at higher scale of an organocatalyst, subjected to oxidative conditions, is demonstrated. Mechanistically, labile &#945;&#8208;ketosulfone has been detected as the intermediate involved in the DROC process. Theoretical calculations, on the key epoxidation step, rationalize the observed stereocontrol, highlighting the important role played by the sulfone group.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical 1,4/5&#8208;Amino Shift Enables Access to Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Featured Primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;Aminoketones under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino shift from the oxygen center of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon center to achieve high value&#8208;added fluoroalkyl&#8208;featured primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;aminoketones is reported. This conversion is initiated by fluoroalkyl radical derived from the EDA (electron donor&#8208;acceptor) complex of Togni's reagent/fluoroalkyl iodides and quinuclidine. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration involves a unique 5(6)&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the N&#8208;atom of ketoxime ethers followed by a cascade N&#8208;O bond cleavage and dehydrogenation sequence. Notably, besides Togni's reagent/fluoroalkyl iodides, this protocol is also compatible with other radical precursors to provide various functionalized primary aminoketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Protein Dynamics to Sense Rapid Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>

         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;scale&#160;calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, exhibiting wide&#8208;ranging temporal kinetics, constitutes a ubiquitous mode of signal transduction. We report a novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted Ca2+  indicator, R&#8208;CatchER, which showed superior kinetics  in vitro  (koff  &#8805;&#160;2x103  s&#8208;1  ,  kon  &#8805;&#160;7x106  M&#8208;1s&#8208;1  ) and in multiple cell types. R&#8208;CatchER captured spatiotemporal ER Ca2+  dynamics in neurons and hotspots at dendritic branchpoints, enabled the first report of ER Ca2+  oscillations mediated by calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs), and revealed ER Ca2+&#8208;based functional cooperativity of CaSR. We elucidate the mechanism of R&#8208;CatchER and propose a principle to rationally design genetically encoded Ca2+  indicators, with a single Ca2+&#8208;binding site and fast kinetics, by tuning rapid fluorescent protein dynamics and the electrostatic potential around the chromophore. The design principle is supported by the development of G&#8208;CatchER2, an upgrade of our previous (G&#8208;)CatchER with improved dynamic range. Our work may facilitate protein design, visualizing Ca2+  dynamics, and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Spirolactams via Sequential C&#8722;H Olefination/Asymmetric [4+1] Spirocyclization under a Simple Co(II)/Chiral Spiro Phosphoric Acid Binary System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented enantioselective synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple Co(II)/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported. A range of biologically important spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams are obtained with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee). The concise, asymmetric synthesis of an aldose reductase inhibitor was successfully achieved. Notably, contrast to previous reports that relied on the use of cyclopentadienyl or its derivatives (achiral Cp*, Cp  tBu  , or chiral Cp  x  ) ligated Co(III) complexes requiring tedious steps to prepare, cheap and commercially available cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate was used as an efficient precatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroboration of Terminal Alkenes and trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diboration of Terminal Alkynes Catalyzed by a Mn(I) Alkyl Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and a 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane (HBPin) is described. In the case of alkenes anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place, while in the case of alkynes the reaction proceeds with excellent trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity. The most active pre&#8208;catalyst is the bench&#8208;stable alkyl bisphosphine Mn(I) complex fac&#8208;[Mn(dippe)(CO)3(CH2CH2CH3)]. The catalytic process is initiated by migratory insertion of a CO ligand into the Mn&#8208;alkyl bond to yield an acyl intermediate which undergoes B&#8208;H bond cleavage of HBPin (in the case of alkenes) and rapid C&#8208;H bond cleavage (in the case of alkynes) forming the active Mn(I) boryl and acetylide catalysts [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(BPin)] and [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(C&#8801;CR)], respectively. A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes was efficiently and selectively borylated. Mechanistic insights are provided based on experimental data and DFT calculations revealing that an acceptorless reaction is operating involving dihydrogen release.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Evolution of Se&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Modulated MoSe2 Pre&#8208;Catalyst in Li&#8211;S Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Witnessing compositional evolution and identifying actual catalytically&#8208;active moiety of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in Li&#8211;S chemistry. Nevertheless, this field remains elusive by far. Herein, we report the scalable salt&#8208;templated synthesis of Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;incorporated MoSe2  architecture (SeVs&#8208;MoSe2  ) and reveal the phase evolution of such defective pre&#8208;catalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs&#8208;MoSe2  is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs&#8208;MoSe2  to MoSeS. Furthermore,  operando  Raman spectroscopy/ex&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote the conversion from Li2S2  to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. Thus&#8208;derived Li&#8211;S battery accordingly exhibits satisfactory rate and cycling capability even under elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67 mg cm&#8211;2  ; 4.0 &#956;L mg&#8211;1S  ). This work is anticipated to open an avenue for designing efficient electrocatalysts toward boosted sulfur chemistry and deepens the understanding of catalytic mechanisms of defective electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

Computational studies suggest the P&#8211;atom transfer to proceed by [2+2]&#8211;cycloaddition of the P&#8801;C bond across the V&#8801;C  t  Bu moiety, followed by a reductive decarbonylation to form V&#8211;C&#8801;O linkage. The nature of the electronic ground state in diamagnetic complexes,  2  and  4  , was further investigated both theoretically and experimentally, using a combination of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, and comparison of salient bond metrics derived from X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural characterization. In combination, these data are consistent with a low&#8208;valent vanadium ion in complexes  2  and  4  .

         <title>Hierarchically Porous MOF/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O to CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2  reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a significant challenge of forming the C&#8722;C bond. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2  nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2  . The active interfaces are favourable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The  d  &#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2  composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2  and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH  3  COOH reached 39.0 &#181;mol&#8226;g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  and 94%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2  for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo obviously facilitated the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Intragenomic decarboxylation of 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular DNA is composed of four canonical nucleosides (dA, dC, dG and T), which form two Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs. In addition, 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mdC) may be present. The methylation of dC to mdC is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Next to these five nucleotides, the genome, particularly of stem cells, contains three further dC derivatives, which are formed by stepwise oxidation of the methyl group of mdC with the help of Tet enzymes. These are 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC, (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC) and finally 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intra&#8208;genomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. Here, we show using metabolic labelling in several cell types that cadC decarboxylates, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8208;C bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Nanoflower Assisted Separation&#8208;free Nucleic Acid Detection Platform with Commercial Pregnancy Test Strip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a constant drive for affordable point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) technologies for the detection of infectious and human diseases. Herein we report a simple platform for DNA detection that takes advantage of four techniques: commercially available pregnancy test strip (PTS), amplicon generation via loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), toehold mediated strand displacement, and noncovalent immobilization of DNA on paper surface with DNA nanoflowers. This simple, separation&#8208;free platform is highly specific, as demonstrated with the detection of rtL180M, a single nucleotide polymorphism observed in hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#160;associated with antiviral drug resistance. It is very sensitive, capable of detecting the targeted mutation at 2 copies/&#956;L. It is able to correctly identify the unmutated and rtL180M genome types of HBV in clinical samples. Given its wide adaptability, we expect this platform can be easily modified for the detection of genetic variations associated with various pathogens and human diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Strain Mapping of Late&#8208;Transition Metal High&#8208;Index Facets Nanoparticle for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although high&#8208;index facets (HIF) endows excellent catalytic activity through undercoordinated sites with strain effect, current characterizations techniques still cannot unravel the detailed strain distributions to understand the origins of electroactivity. Nevertheless, theoretical principles to quantify the structural features and their effects to catalytic activity improvements on HIFs are still lacking, which renders the experimental efforts laborious. In this work, we explore the quantification of surface structural features and establish a database of atomic strain distributions for the late&#8208;transition metal HIF nanoparticle models. The surface reactivities of the nanoparticles have been examined by adsorption energy calculations and their correlations with structural features are observed. Our proposed theoretical principles on surface characterization of high&#8208;index facets nanomaterials will promote the design and synthesis of efficient transition metal based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;splicing strategy to construct a near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe for UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase1A1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity, on&#8208;off or blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing strategy&#8221; to construct a highly selective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe  HHC  for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720 nm after UGT1A1 metabolism.  HHC  was then successfully used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals, and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform&#8208;specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high&#8208;throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function. This practical &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing strategy&#8221; is particularly powerful in developing highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Parent B2N2&#8208;Perylenes with Different BN Orientations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing BN units into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons expands the chemical space of conjugated materials with novel properties. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific BN positions and orientations. Here, three new parent B  2  N  2  &#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations are synthesized with BN&#8208;naphthalene as the building block, providing systematic insight into the effects of BN incorporation with different orientations on the structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties. The intermolecular dipole&#8208;dipole interaction shortens the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance. The crystal structure, (anti)aromaticity, and photophysical properties vary with the change of BN orientation. The revealed BN doping effects may provide a guideline for the synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific stacking structures, and the synthetic strategy employed here can be extended toward the synthesis of larger BN&#8208;embedded PAHs with adjustable BN patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate removal from water with low pollution concentration and its subsequent electroreduction to higher&#8208;value ammonia is becoming progressively essential. However, this process still suffers from low selectivity and activity due to slow mass transfer of nitrate and the induced limited reagent supply to reaction interface. Herein, we demonstrate that a built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO  3  &#8211;  ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO  3  RR). A model electrocatalyst are created by stacking CuCl&#160;(111) and rutile TiO  2  (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO  2  to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Molecular dynamics simulation and finite element analysis suggest that this built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO  3  &#8211;  ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also rises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower down energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH  3  product selectivity of 98.6%, a low NO  2  &#8211;  production of &lt;0.6%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4 h  &#8211;1  is achieved with this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, which are all the best among studies reported at 100 mg L  &#8211;1  of nitrate concentration to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Encoding of Triple&#8208;Bond Raman Scattering of Single Polymer Nanoparticles for Multiplexed Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform polymer nanoparticles were constructed by green emulsion polymerization, overcoming the disadvantage of large &#960;&#8208;bond conjugation while keeping many triple bonds to realize stimulated Raman scattering imaging. 15 distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations were achieved by Raman shift/intensity encoding in the biological silence region (1800&#8211;2800&#8197;cm&#8722;1), thus providing a tool for high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy in combination with innovative tagging strategies offers great potential as a universal high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging tool. Here, we report rationally tailored small molecular monomers containing triple&#8208;bond units with large Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections, which can be polymerized at the nanoscale for enhancement of SRS contrast with smaller but brighter optical nanotags with artificial fingerprint output. From this, a class of triple&#8208;bond rich polymer nanoparticles (NPs) was engineered by regulating the relative dosages of three chemically different triple&#8208;bond monomers in co&#8208;polymerization. The bonding strategy allowed for 15 spectrally distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations. These accurately structured nano molecular aggregates, rather than long&#8208;chain macromolecules, could establish a universal method for generating small&#8208;sized biological SRS imaging tags with high sensitivity for high&#8208;throughput multi&#8208;color biomedical imaging.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emissive Carbon Dots Gels for Octopus&#8208;Inspired Shape/Color Synergistically Adjustable Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable symmetric surfaces were used to develop aggregation&#8208;induced emissive CD polymer gels with reversible two&#8208;switch&#8208;mode fluorescence (blue dispersed fluorescence and red AIE), followed by the fabrication of anisotropic swimming robots showing octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and autonomous locomotion on the water surface.







Abstract
Some living organisms such as the octopus have fantastic abilities to simultaneously swim away and alter body color/morphology for disguise and self&#8208;protection, especially when there is a threat perception. However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi&#8208;functional bio&#8208;inspired intelligent soft robotics.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol and Phenyl Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry is used to generate polyphenols from small molecules and biological macromolecules containing phenolic groups, enabling the subsequent coordination of the polyphenols with metal ions to engineer coatings on a variety of substrates.







Abstract
We report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412&#8197;kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional .OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives and different metal ions including FeII, FeIII, CuII, and CoII. In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. The properties of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for surface engineering.

         <title>Direct Detection of Surface Species Formed on Iridium Electrocatalysts during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to directly examine the oxidation state and surface composition of nanosized Ir electrodes after oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was developed. Atom probe tomography reveals compositional changes in the topmost surface and subsurface on various Ir planes during OER. This approach provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into surface changes during electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. Herein, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm of (024), (026), (113), and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8722;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick subsurface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8722;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8722;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of amidines has been developed for the synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers. A wide range of benzimidazole derivatives containing N&#8722;C axial chirality can be conveniently constructed in excellent yields and enantioselectivities by intramolecular amination.







Abstract
N&#8722;C Biaryl atropisomers are prevalent in natural products and bioactive drug molecules. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such molecules has not developed significantly. Particularly, the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers by stereoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination remains unprecedented. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy is presented for the synthesis of N&#8722;C axially chiral biaryl molecules. A broad spectrum of N&#8722;C axially chiral compounds was obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). The practicality of this reaction was validated in the synthesis of useful biological molecules.

         <title>Picomole&#8208;Scale Synthesis and Screening of Macrocyclic Compound Libraries by Acoustic Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach has been developed for synthesizing and screening large libraries of macrocyclic compounds at a picomole scale. The macrocycles were synthesized by combinatorially transferring reagents in 2.5&#8197;nL droplets to microwell plates using acoustic waves. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a library of 2700 macrocyclic compounds was synthesized and potent inhibitors of the protein&#8211;protein interaction p53&#8211;MDM2 were identified.







Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are an attractive class of therapeutic ligands against challenging targets, such as protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, the development of macrocycles as drugs is hindered by the lack of large combinatorial macrocyclic libraries, which are cumbersome, expensive, and time consuming to make, screen, and deconvolute. Here, we established a strategy for synthesizing and screening combinatorial libraries on a picomolar scale by using acoustic droplet ejection to combine building blocks at nanoliter volumes, which reduced the reaction volumes, reagent consumption, and synthesis time. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we assembled a 2700&#8208;member target&#8208;focused macrocyclic library that we could subsequently assay in the same microtiter synthesis plates, saving the need for additional transfers and deconvolution schemes. We screened the library against the MDM2&#8211;p53 protein&#8211;protein interaction and generated micromolar and sub&#8208;micromolar inhibitors. Our approach based on acoustic liquid transfer provides a general strategy for the development of macrocycle ligands.

         <title>Introducing A New Class of Sulfonyl Fluoride Hubs via Radical Chloro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF) is introduced. BCASF can serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of a wide spectrum of alkenylsulfonyl fluorides.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro&#8208;fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as cis alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;-chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF) is introduced. BCASF can serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of a wide spectrum of alkenylsulfonyl fluorides.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;-chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro-fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late-stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure CO Electroreduction at Silver Produces Ethanol and Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is of great interest. Here, CO reduction was studied on silver at high surface coverage, as DFT results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. The results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol, ethylene glycol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO2, copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.

         <title>Template Guiding for the Encapsulation of Uniformly Subnanometric Platinum Clusters in Beta&#8208;Zeolites Enabling High Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;guidance protocol was reported for the synthesis of subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite. The metal ions are guided to the internal channels of the zeolite template through electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention because of their unique properties as heterogeneous catalysts. However, it is challenging to obtain uniformly distributed metal clusters under synthesis and reaction conditions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;guidance protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, with the metal ions anchored to the internal channels of the zeolite template via electrostatic interactions. Pt metal clusters with a narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22&#8197;nm have been obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with a broad range of Si/Al molar ratios (15&#8211;200). The uniformly distributed Pt clusters in Pt@H&#8208;beta are subject to strong electron withdrawal by the zeolite, which promotes transfer of active hydrogen, providing excellent activity and stability in hydrodeoxygenation reactions. A general strategy is thus proposed for the encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites with high thermal stability.

We show that protonated merocyanines can act as reversible photoacids even when buffered with NaOH, attaining tunable and fully reversible jumps of up to 3 pH units between pH&#8197;7 and 4.

         <title>Chiral Distorted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes Bearing a Nonagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The larger the ring, the better the chiroptical properties: A new family of highly distorted nanographenes is presented incorporating for the first time a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle. The nonagon&#8208;containing [5]helicene results in an extremely twisted helical moiety and provides to the final chiral PAHs with enhanced chiroptical properties.







Abstract
A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs|=4.2&#215;10&#8722;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.

         <title>Diarylethene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Inhibitors of Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic diarylethene&#8208;containing analogues of the sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1) can modulate activity of serine proteases in the nanomolar&#8211;micromolar range in highly efficient photocontrollable manner.







Abstract
A bicyclic peptide scaffold was chemically adapted to generate diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of serine protease Bos taurus trypsin&#8197;1 (T1). Starting from a prototype molecule&#8212;sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1)&#8212;we obtained light&#8208;controllable inhibitors of T1 with Ki in the low nanomolar range, whose activity could be modulated over 20&#8208;fold by irradiation. The inhibitory potency as well as resistance to proteolytic degradation were systematically studied on a series of 17&#8197;SFTI&#8208;1 analogues. The hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the structure of inhibitors and possibly the enzyme&#8211;inhibitor binding dynamics were affected by isomerization of the photoswitch. The feasibility of manipulating enzyme activity in time and space was demonstrated by controlled digestion of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and an antimicrobial peptide BP100&#8208;RW. Finally, our design principles of diarylethene photoswitches are shown to apply also for the development of other serine protease inhibitors.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Ni&#8208;based Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and  in situ  experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion.&#160;The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ~5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Carbochlorocarbonylation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons via C&#8211;COCl Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8211;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8211;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride  in situ  . The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes which utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Selective Synthesis of Semiconductive Silver Thiolate Coordination Polymer with Segregated Paths for Holes and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;S bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties, thus drawing attention. However, the development of new (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)  n  &#8208;structured CPs is hindered by their crystallization difficulty. Herein, we use machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H  3  ttc)&#8208;based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8211;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag  2  Httc]  n  , features a 3D extended infinite Ag&#8211;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first&#8208;principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag  2  Httc]  n  is highly photoconductive (  &#966;  &#931;  &#956;  max  = 1.6 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  ). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs difficult to crystallize with selective topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Functionalization of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks to Achieve Exceptionally High Iodine Capture Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption&#8208;based iodine (I  2  ) capture is of great potential for the treatment of radioactive nuclear waste. Here we employ a &#8220;multivariate&#8221; synthetic strategy to construct ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with large surface area, high pore volume, and abundant binding sites for I  2  capture. The optimized material iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 exhibits static I  2  uptake capacity of 10.21 g&#183;g  &#8208;1  at 75 &#176;C, and dynamic uptake capacity of 2.79 g&#183;g  &#8208;1  at ~400 ppm of I  2  and 25 &#176;C, far exceeding the performances of previously reported adsorbents under similar conditions. It also shows fast adsorption kinetics, good moisture tolerance, and full reusability. The promoting effect of ionic groups on I  2  adsorption has been elucidated by experimentally identifying the iodine species adsorbed at different sites and calculating their binding energies. This work demonstrates the essential role of balancing the textural properties and binding sites of the adsorbent in achieving high I  2  capture performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a Tb(III)&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly desirable to develop high&#8208;performance chemical sensors, especially those based on the fluorescence intensity enhancement (also known as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;) sensing. It is the same and more challenging for lanthanide materials, on account of the difficulty to sensitize the metal&#8208;chromophores in a desired way. Herein, guided by a&#160; &#8220; second&#8208;sphere interaction &#8221; strategy, we synthesized a polyamine&#8208;derived hexa&#8208;carboxylate ligand (H  6  L) to fabricate the Tb( &#8546; )&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing of methyl amine in aqueous environment with ultra&#8208;low detection limit&#160; and high turn&#8208;on efficiency . MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with a secondary coordination sphere that is densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Through H&#8208;bond interactions on second&#8208;coordination sphere, nonradiative pathways were suppressed as a result of binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand, thereby leading to luminescence enhancement. Such &#8220;remote&#8221; interacting mechanism involved in the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the guest@MMCF&#8208;4 and molecular dynamic simulation studies. For the first time, &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing of organic analytes in aqueous media was achieved via the rational design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb (III) in Ln&#8208;MOFs. Our study contributes a new and promising design strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing for not only lanthanide MOFs, but also luminescent materials driven by other metal chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Reactive Sites and Surface Traps in Chalcopyrite Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gathering information on the atomic nature of reactive sites and trap states is key to fine tuning catalysis and suppressing deleterious surface voltage losses in photoelectrochemical technologies. Here, spectroelectrochemical and computational methods were combined to investigate a model photocathode from the promising chalcopyrite family: CuIn  0.3  Ga  0.7  S  2  . We found that voltage losses are linked to traps induced by surface Ga and In vacancies, whereas operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysis occurred at Ga, In and S sites. This study allows establishing a bridge between the chalcopyrite&#8217;s performance and its surface&#8217;s chemistry, where avoiding formation of Ga and In vacancies is crucial to achieve high activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;activity relationships in nonenzymatic template&#8208;directed RNA synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a  3  E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.</dc:description>

The reaction is also compatible for the coupling of internal alkenes, secondary benzyl halides and variously substituted arylzinc reagents.

         <title>Programmable Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of DNA Origami with Polynucleotide Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated TdT&#8208;catalyzed polymerization enables the programmable, site&#8208;specific modification of DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes of different heights and compositions. The brush layer protects the origami core from nuclease degradation, which enables the application of DNA origami&#8208;based nanostructures for smart drug delivery and other biomedical applications.







Abstract
Combining surface&#8208;initiated, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) catalyzed enzymatic polymerization (SI&#8208;TcEP) with precisely engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) presents an innovative pathway for the generation of stable, polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalized DNA nanostructures. We demonstrate that SI&#8208;TcEP can site&#8208;specifically pattern DONs with brushes containing both natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides. The brush functionalization can be precisely controlled in terms of the location of initiation sites on the origami core and the brush height and composition. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations predict the conformation of the brush&#8208;functionalized DONs that agree well with the experimentally observed morphologies. We find that polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalization increases the nuclease resistance of DONs significantly, and that this stability can be spatially programmed through the site&#8208;specific growth of polynucleotide brushes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DONs with brushes of natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides provides access to a large range of functionalized DON architectures that would allow for further supramolecular assembly, and for potential applications in smart nanoscale delivery systems.

         <title>Schottky Barrier&#8208;Induced Surface Electric Field Boosts Universal Reduction of NOx&#8722; in Water to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable surface electric field induced by Schottky barrier boosts the reduction of NOx&#8722; in water for ammonia production. The tunable amounts of Ni nanoparticles inside a nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon support could gradually enhance the surface electric field for enriching and fixation of NOx&#8722; anions, rendering high Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% for ammonia production from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction.







Abstract
NOx&#8722; reduction acts a pivotal part in sustaining globally balanced nitrogen cycle and restoring ecological environment, ammonia (NH3) is an excellent energy carrier and the most valuable product among all the products of NOx&#8722; reduction reaction, the selectivity of which is far from satisfaction due to the intrinsic complexity of multiple&#8208;electron NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. Here, we utilize the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field, by the construction of high density of electron&#8208;deficient Ni nanoparticles inside nitrogen&#8208;rich carbons, to facilitate the enrichment and fixation of all NOx&#8722; anions on the electrode surface, including NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, and thus ensure the final selectivity to NH3. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that NOx&#8722; anions were continuously captured by the electrode with largely enhanced surface electric field, providing excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction. Remarkably, the NH3 yield rate could reach the maximum of 25.1&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in electrocatalytic NO2&#8722; reduction reaction, outperforming the maximum in the literature by a factor of 6.3 in neutral solution. With the universality of our electrocatalyst, all sorts of available electrolytes containing NOx&#8722; pollutants, including seawater or wastewater, could be directly used for ammonia production in potential through sustainable electrochemical technology.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. Remarkably, the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate could reach the maximum of 25.1&#8197;mg&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in electrocatalytic NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction reaction, outperforming the maximum in the literature by a factor of 6.3 in neutral solution. With the universality of our electrocatalyst, all sorts of available electrolytes containing NO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pollutants, including seawater or wastewater, could be directly used for ammonia production in potential through sustainable electrochemical technology.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sustainable Production of Benzylamines from Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy for the conversion of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compound into benzylamines through one&#8208;pot C&#8722;O bond cleavage and C&#8722;N bond formation with secondary amines serving as both amine sources and reducing agents was developed. The feasibility for the production of bio&#8208;based benzylamines from lignin in a two&#8208;step process was introduced in these processes.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of lignin into heteroatom functionalized chemicals is of great importance to bring the biorefinery concept into reality. Herein, a new strategy was designed for direct transformation of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds into benzylamines and phenols in moderate to excellent yields in the presence of organic amines. The transformation involves dehydrogenation of C&#945;&#8722;OH, hydrogenolysis of the C&#946;&#8722;O bond and reductive amination in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Experimental data suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over the other two reactions and secondary amines serve as both reducing agents and amine sources in the transformation. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;lignin to benzylamines&#8221; was demonstrated by a two&#8208;step process. This work represents a first example of synthesis of benzylamines from lignin, thus providing a new opportunity for the sustainable synthesis of benzylamines from renewable biomass, and expanding the products pool of biomass conversion to meet future biorefinery demands.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Fluorinated Allenes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkylation/Defluorination of Propargyl Difluorides with Alkylzincs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of propargyl difluorides, R1CF2C&#8801;CR2, with alkylzincs, R3ZnCl, giving axially chiral fluorinated allenes, R1FC=C=CR2R3, with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) was found to be catalyzed by a chiral diene/rhodium complex. A key step in the catalytic cycle is selective elimination of one of the enantiotopic fluorides at the &#946;&#8208;position of an alkenyl&#8208;Rh intermediate, which is generated by regioselective addition of R3&#8208;Rh onto the triple bond of the starting difluorides.

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the current study, with the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic techniques, transient kinetic analysis, and implementation of robust experimental methodologies, we resolve the nature of catalytic active sites and reaction mechanism for oxidative coupling of methane over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.







Abstract
The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of in situ Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe (H2&#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na2WO4 active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable surface Na&#8208;WOx sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (i) surface Na&#8208;WOx sites are responsible for selectively activating CH4 to C2Hx and over&#8208;oxidizing CHy to CO and (ii) molten Na2WO4 phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Reversible Free Radical Catalysis for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Cancer Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;X nanosheet is developed as a novel free radical regulator. It shows dual&#8208;modal free radical catalysis adaptive to environment changes, enabling amplified production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions, while scavenging free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells.







Abstract
Amplifying free radical production by chemical dynamic catalysis to cause oxidative damage to cancer cells has received extensive interest for cancer&#8208;specific therapy. The major challenge is inevitable negative modulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by these species, hindering durable effectiveness. Here we show for the first time an oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Bi&#8208;based regulator that allows environment&#8208;adaptive free radical catalysis. Specifically, the regulator catalyzes production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions yet scavenges accumulation of free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells. Atomic&#8208;level mechanistic studies reveal that such dual&#8208;modal regulating behavior is dominated by oxygen vacancies that well fit for free radical catalytic kinetics, along with distinguished cellular fates of this regulator. With this smart regulator, a &#8220;two birds with one shot&#8221; cancer dynamic therapy can be expected.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplifying free radical production by chemical dynamic catalysis to cause oxidative damage to cancer cells has received extensive interest for cancer-specific therapy. The major challenge is inevitable negative modulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by these species, hindering durable effectiveness. Here we show for the first time an oxygen vacancy-rich Bi-based regulator that allows environment-adaptive free radical catalysis. Specifically, the regulator catalyzes production of highly toxic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions yet scavenges accumulation of free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME-associated noncancerous cells. Atomic-level mechanistic studies reveal that such dual-modal regulating behavior is dominated by oxygen vacancies that well fit for free radical catalytic kinetics, along with distinguished cellular fates of this regulator. With this smart regulator, a &#8220;two birds with one shot&#8221; cancer dynamic therapy can be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Cadmium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst by Tuning of the Axial Coordination Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with an optimized CdN4S1 moiety were designed and prepared. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO reached 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the TOF of CO production was as high as 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1. Cd SACs are effective for reduction of CO2 to CO. Introduction of an axial coordination structure boosts the activity of CO2RR and also enhances the selectivity of CO2RR by suppressing the adsorption of *H.







Abstract
Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, it was found that Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have excellent performance in activating CO2, and the introduction of axial coordination structure to Cd SACs cannot only further decrease the free energy barrier of CO2 reduction, but also suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the above discovery, we designed and synthesized a novel Cd SAC that comprises an optimized CdN4S1 moiety incorporated in a carbon matrix. It was shown that the catalyst exhibited outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction to CO. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO could reach up to 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type electrolysis cell, and the turnover frequency (TOF) value could achieve 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which was much higher than that reported to date. This work shows a successful example of how to design highly efficient catalysts guided by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Carbonyl Hypoiodites as Extremely Strong Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl hypoiodites possess very strongly polarized iodine atoms, including what is now the largest known &#963;&#8208;hole for a neutral compound, and act as strong halogen bond donors. When strong Lewis bases, for example DMAP, are used as halogen bond acceptors, the iodine atom, for all intents and purposes, transfers from the oxygen to nitrogen atom to give an ion&#8208;pair of the general form [RCOO&#8722;][I&#8722;+N(DMAP)] with an O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N halogen bond.







Abstract
Neutral halogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes were prepared from in situ formed carbonyl hypoiodites and aromatic organic bases. The carbonyl hypoiodites have a strongly polarized iodine atom with larger &#963;&#8208;holes than any known uncharged halogen bond donor. Modulating the Lewis basicity of the selected pyridine derivatives and carboxylates leads to halogen&#8208;bonded complexes where the classical O&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N halogen bond transforms more into a halogen&#8208;bonded COO&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N+ ion&#8208;pair (salt) with an asymmetric O&#8722;I&#8722;N moiety. X&#8208;ray analyses, NMR studies, and calculations reveal the halogen bonding geometries of the carbonyl hypoiodite&#8208;based O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes, confirming that in the solid&#8208;state the iodine atom is much closer to the N&#8208;atom of the pyridine derivatives than its original position at the carboxylate O&#8208;atom.

         <title>Antiaromatic 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes (see structure) were synthesized and found to exhibit distinct antiaromaticity as manifested by pronounced bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
s&#8208;Indacene is a classical non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon that contains 12 &#960;&#8208;electrons in a cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugation system. Herein, we report its nitrogen&#8208;doped analogue, 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes were readily prepared from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dichlorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diamine through a two&#8208;step transformation consisting of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Larock cyclization with diaryl acetylenes followed by hydrogen abstraction. The thus obtained 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes exhibited distinct antiaromaticity, as manifested in clear bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene core is effectively conjugated with the peripheral aryl groups, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of the absorption spectra and redox properties. The two possible localized forms of 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene were compared in terms of their energetic aspects.

         <title>Isomerization of a cis&#8208;(2&#8208;Borylalkenyl)Gold Complex via a Retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;Metalate Shift: Cleavage of a C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si Bond trans to a C&#8722;Au Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected isomerization of cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complexes, which formed through the first alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond, was observed with structural characterization of intermediates and products. Kinetic analysis for isomerization of isolated intermediate and detailed DFT calculations revealed a new elementary reaction, i.e., a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221; that contains anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination.







Abstract
This manuscript describes the first example of an alkyne insertion to the Au&#8722;B bond of a di(o&#8208;tolyl)borylgold complex to afford a cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complex, and its isomerization to result in interchanging substituents on the alkenyl carbon atom and the boron atom. The former reaction is the first example of an alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond. In the latter reaction, the regiochemistry of the isomerized alkenylgold products varied depending on the substituents. DFT calculations revealed the formation of gold alkynylborates as a common intermediate via a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221;, which can be considered as an anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination, and identified a subsequent 1,2&#8208;metalate shift as the regiochemistry&#8208;determining step. Relative energies of the transition states to each isomer and natural&#8208;bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses were used to clearly rationalize the regiochemistry of the products.

         <title>Monolayer&#8208;to&#8208;Multilayer Dimensionality Reconstruction in a Hybrid Perovskite for Exploring Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Enables Passive X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7 was successfully obtained by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, which enables unprecedented passive X&#8208;ray detection with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Halide hybrid perovskites are attracting considerable attention as highly promising candidates for directly sensing X&#8208;ray radiation, but it is challenging to realize passive X&#8208;ray detection without an external power supply. However, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectrics promotes the independent separation of photoexcited carriers. Herein, by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (P&#8208;2D) monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, we obtained a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7. Converting P&#8208;2D into Q&#8208;2D perovskite stimulates a significant BPVE associated with robust ferroelectricity, as well as an enhanced mobility lifetime product. These features show the promise of the fabrication of the first passive X&#8208;ray detector based on ferroelectrics with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at zero bias, which is even superior to the value of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;Se detector operated at relatively high bias.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Transformations of Nitrogen&#8208;Oxyanions to Ammonia via Oxoammonium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;assisted transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) in the presence of 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8208;H) lead to a diaryl oxoammonium species [(TMB)2NO]+. In addition to the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative chemistry of [(TMB)2NO]+ towards oxidizable substrates, this report illustrates water&#8208;promoted decomposition of [(TMB)2NO]+ affording ammonia.







Abstract
Transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) to ammonia impart pivotal roles in sustainable biogeochemical processes. While metal&#8208;mediated reductions of NOx&#8722; are relatively well known, this report illustrates proton&#8208;assisted transformations of NOx&#8722; anions in the presence of electron&#8208;rich aromatics such as 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8722;H, 1&#8201;a) leading to the formation of diaryl oxoammonium salt [(TMB)2N+=O][NO3&#8722;] (2&#8201;a) via the intermediacy of nitrosonium cation (NO+). Detailed characterizations including UV/Vis, multinuclear NMR, FT&#8208;IR, HRMS, X&#8208;ray analyses on a set of closely related metastable diaryl oxoammonium [Ar2N+=O] species disclose unambiguous structural and spectroscopic signatures. Oxoammonium salt 2&#8201;a exhibits 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative reactivity in the presence of oxidizable substrates such as benzylamine, thiol, and ferrocene. Intriguingly, reaction of 2&#8201;a with water affords ammonia. Perhaps of broader significance, this work reveals a new metal&#8208;free route germane to the conversion of NOx&#8197;to&#8197;NH3.

         <title>N&#8208;Atom Deletion in Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;atom deletion from N&#8208;heterocycles via N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation, Curtius&#8208;type rearrangement and rearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diazene intermediates is described. It provides a unique opportunity to achieve ring contraction of (n+1)&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles to n&#8208;membered cycles.







Abstract
Excising the nitrogen in secondary amines, and coupling the two residual fragments is a skeletal editing strategy that can be used to construct molecules with new skeletons, but which has been largely unexplored. Here we report a versatile method of N&#8208;atom excision from N&#8208;heterocycles. The process uses readily available N&#8208;heterocycles as substrates, and proceeds by N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation followed by the rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide intermediates, providing various cyclic products. Examples are provided of deletion of nitrogen from natural products, synthesis of chiral O&#8208;heterocycles from commercially available chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, formal inert C&#8722;H functionalization through a sequence of N&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization and N&#8208;atom deletion reactions in which the N&#8208;atom can serve as a traceless directing group.

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Domino Reaction Enables Fully Controlled Non&#8208;Statistical Synthesis of Hexaarylbenzene with Six Different Aryl Groups**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high yielding and scalable metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step linear domino reaction results in functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB) and opens the door for making a broad variety of synthetically challenging hexaarylbenzene (HAB) molecules with six different aryl groups.







Abstract
Hexaarylbenzene (HAB) derivatives are versatile aromatic systems playing a significant role as chromophores, liquid crystalline materials, molecular receptors, molecular&#8208;scale devices, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and candidates for organic electronics. Statistical synthesis of simple symmetrical HABs is known via cyclotrimerization or Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. By contrast, the synthesis of more complex, asymmetrical systems, and without involvement of statistical steps, remains an unsolved problem. Here we present a generally applicable synthetic strategy to access asymmetrical HAB via an atom&#8208;economical and high&#8208;yielding metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step domino reaction using nitrostyrenes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins as easily available starting materials. Resulting domino product&#8212;functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB)&#8212;can be used as a key starting compound to furnish asymmetrically substituted hexaarylbenzenes in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps. This straightforward domino process represents a distinct approach to create diverse and still unexplored HAB scaffolds, containing six different aromatic rings around central benzene core.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels for Protein Recognition: Direct Proof of Specific Binding Sites by Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIPs for protein recognition are often synthesized by the epitope approach. The epitope is a short surface&#8208;exposed peptide of the protein. Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies were used to prove the evidence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of the peptide epitope in the corresponding MIP nanogel. No binding was observed with a non&#8208;related peptide.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor&#8208;made synthetic antibodies possessing specific binding cavities designed for a target molecule. Currently, MIPs for protein targets are synthesized by imprinting a short surface&#8208;exposed fragment of the protein, called epitope or antigenic determinant. However, finding the epitope par excellence that will yield a peptide &#8220;synthetic antibody&#8221; cross&#8208;reacting exclusively with the protein from which it is derived, is not easy.

&lt;p&gt;MIPs for protein recognition are often synthesized by the epitope approach. The epitope is a short surface-exposed peptide of the protein. Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies were used to prove the evidence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of the peptide epitope in the corresponding MIP nanogel. No binding was observed with a non-related peptide.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor-made synthetic antibodies possessing specific binding cavities designed for a target molecule. Currently, MIPs for protein targets are synthesized by imprinting a short surface-exposed fragment of the protein, called epitope or antigenic determinant. However, finding the epitope par excellence that will yield a peptide &#8220;synthetic antibody&#8221; cross-reacting exclusively with the protein from which it is derived, is not easy. We propose a computer-based rational approach to unambiguously identify the &#8220;best&#8221; epitope candidate. Then, using Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies, we prove the existence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of this peptide epitope in the MIP nanogel. The optimized MIP nanogel could bind the epitope and cognate protein with a high affinity and selectivity. The study was performed on Hepatitis&#8197;A Virus Cell Receptor-1 protein, also known as KIM-1 and TIM-1, for its ubiquitous implication in numerous pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Hole Trapping in Carbon Dot/Oxygen&#8208;Modified Carbon Nitride Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Methanol Production from CO2 under Neutral Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified carbon nitride with O&#8208;containing linkers decorated with carbon dots selectively produces methanol from CO2 and water with the benchmark quantum yield of ca. 6&#8201;%. Transient absorption spectroscopic investigation shows that extraction of holes before trapping by the carbon dots is key for the remarkable performance.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of alcohols from CO2 is still unsatisfactory owing to the rapid charge relaxation compared to the sluggish photoreactions and the oxidation of alcohol products. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 is reduced to methanol with 100&#8201;% selectivity using water as the only electron donor on a carbon nitride&#8208;like polymer (FAT) decorated with carbon dots. The quantum efficiency of 5.9&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) is 300&#8201;% higher than the previously reported carbon nitride junction. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we observed that holes in FAT could be extracted by the carbon dots with nearly 75&#8201;% efficiency before they become unreactive by trapping. Extraction of holes resulted in a greater density of photoelectrons, indicative of reduced recombination of shorter&#8208;lived reactive electrons. This work offers a strategy to promote photocatalysis by increasing the amount of reactive photogenerated charges via structure engineering and extraction before energy losses by deep trapping.

         <title>A New Dioxazolone for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Aminoalcohols via Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal aminoalcohols are widespread structural motifs in bioactive molecules. We report the development of a new dioxazolone reagent containing a p&#8208;nitrophenyldifluoromethyl group, which 1. displays a good safety profile; 2. shows a remarkably high reactivity in the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds; 3. leads to amide products which can be hydrolyzed under mild conditions. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary C&#8211;H bonds of tertiary and secondary alcohols, as well as secondary C&#8211;H bonds of cyclic secondary alcohols. This method provides an easy access to free 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols after efficient and mild cleavage of the oxime directing group and activated amide.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent behavior elucidation of disilane&#8208;bridged D&#8210;A&#8210;D triad composed of phenothiazine and thienopyrazine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A s&#8210;p extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8210;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3 kcal/mol. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8210;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8210;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wittig reaction within a dearomatized pyridine ring system results in 4&#8208;alkylated pyridines, a valuable motif in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sciences. N&#8208;Triazinyl salts are key to this strategy, and a range of substituted pyridines and aldehydes are amenable. Late&#8208;stage methylation is also feasible using a formaldehyde surrogate.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine N&#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and N&#8208;triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2&#8208;sp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.

         <title>An Efficient Diazirine&#8208;Based Four&#8208;Armed Cross&#8208;linker for Photo&#8208;patterning of Polymeric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetra&#8208;diazirine based cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) is developed for the universal patterning of p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar conjugated polymers by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. The interchain packing orders, the thin film morphologies and the charge carrier mobilities of four conjugated polymers retain well after patterning.







Abstract
A diazirine&#8208;based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) with a tetrahedron geometry is presented for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. After blending of 4CNN with no more than 3&#8201;% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was achieved; regular patterns with size as small as 5&#8197;&#956;m were prepared with appropriate photomasks after 365&#8197;nm irradiation for just 40&#8197;s. The interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking and the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. A complementary&#8208;like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo&#8208;patterning of the p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. The results show that 4CNN is a new generation of cross&#8208;linker for the photo&#8208;patterning of polymeric semiconductors for all&#8208;solution&#8208;processible flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Spin Interactions in One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of a Cumulene&#8208;Based Singlet Biradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet biradical based on [5]cumulene end&#8208;capped with phenalenyl moieties was synthesized. The strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking tendency of phenalenyl units led to controlled self&#8208;assembly, with the formation of one&#8208;dimensional chain assemblies. Variable&#8208;temperature structural and Raman spectroscopic studies demonstrated that intramolecular spin pairs forming cumulene bonds coupled intermolecularly to form a continuum spin system at low temperatures (see picture).







Abstract
The synthesis of phenalenyl&#8208;endcapped [5]cumulene as a cumulene&#8208;based singlet biradical and the spin correlation changes of one&#8208;dimensional aggregates are described. The high propensity for self&#8208;aggregation of phenalenyl rings and the introduction of bulky substituents into the appropriate positions led to the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional chain assembly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis indicated that the bond length alternation of the cumulene chain increased with decreasing temperature, along with improved overlapping of the phenalenyl rings. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that a localized spin pair within the molecule decouples at low temperatures, and a continuum spin system involving intra&#8208; and intermolecular spin&#8211;spin interactions emerges in the one&#8208;dimensional chain.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Stabilized Organic Cocrystals for Biological Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic co&#8208;crystals are solid&#8208;state multifunctional materials with intriguing properties whereas the supramolecular interactions within co&#8208;crystals limited their stability in solution and their application in biology. Utilizing metal&#8211;organic framework to stabilize and strengthen the charge&#8208;transfer interaction between electron donor and electron acceptor, a water&#8208;dispersible co&#8208;crystal was obtained and applied in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and intriguing properties, but supramolecular interactions restrict their stability in aqueous solution, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we report on the first biological application of aqueous dispersible self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca2+ as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8211;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47&#8197;&#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be attained and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8&#8201;%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials; it is also much higher than that of the FDA approved photothermal agent ICG as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy.

         <title>Thionitrite and Perthionitrite in NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity through formation of HSNO and HSSNO. Zinc complexes of their conjugate bases Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) result in stabilization of these anions at a biologically relevant metal site yet reveal disparate signaling output upon reaction with thiols.







Abstract
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity. HSNO and HSSNO with their conjugate bases &#8722;SNO and &#8722;SSNO form in the reaction of H2S with NO as well as S&#8208;nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitrite (NO2&#8722;) that serve as NO reservoirs. While HSNO and HSSNO are elusive, their conjugate bases form isolable zinc complexes Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) supported by tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands. Reaction of Na(15&#8208;C&#8208;5)SSNO with Ph,MeTpZn(ClO4) provides Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) that undergoes S&#8208;atom removal by PEt3 to give Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and S=PEt3. Unexpectedly stable at room temperature, these Zn&#8208;SNO and Zn&#8208;SSNO complexes release NO upon heating. Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) quickly react with acidic thiols such as C6F5SH to form N2O and NO, respectively. Increasing the thiol basicity in p&#8208;substituted aromatic thiols 4&#8722;XArSH in the reaction with Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) turns on competing S&#8208;nitrosation to form Ph,MeTpZn&#8208;SH and RSNO, the latter a known precursor for NO.

         <title>Coupling electrocatalytic NO oxidation over carbon cloth with hydrogen evolution reaction for nitrate synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NO is a harmful pollutant to the environment. The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and value&#8208;added chemicals sacrifice. In this work, the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma&#8208;treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as the promising anode substitution reaction to couple with hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen&#8208;containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39 V and 1.07 V were applied to reach the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, superior than that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Modulation  Caused by&#160;Interfacial Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M (M = Ru, Ir, Pd) Bonding for Accelerating Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing definite metal&#8208;support interfacial bond is an effective strategy for optimizing the intrinsic activity of noble metals, but rather challenging. Herein, a series of quantum&#8208;sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni&#8208;MOF, M = Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal&#8208;oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni&#8208;MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics.  As a result  , the representative Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and  recent noble&#8208;metal catalysts.  Furthermore, theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.</dc:description>

         <title>EDTA Lewis basic molecule as a highly active electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active catalysts in hydrogenation reduction of CO  2  are mainly heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The complex coordination environments and multiple active sites in a heterogeneous catalyst always result in a low selectivity of target product, while molecular catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites and tailorable structures allow mechanism&#8208;based selectivity optimization. Herein, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) moleculars were firstly immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotube as a catalyst for transferring CO  2  to CH  4  with an excellent performance, exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6% toward CH  4  and a partial current density of &#8208;16.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  at a potential of &#8208;1.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Lewis basic COO  &#8208;  groups in EDTA molecules are the active sites for CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). The energy barrier for the generation of CO from *CO intermediate is as high as 0.52 eV, while the further protonation of *CO to *CHO follows an energetic downhill path (&#8208;1.57 eV), resulting in a high selectivity of CH  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Capillary&#8208;bound dense micelle brush supports for continuous flow catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow reactors are appealing alternatives to conventional batch reactors for heterogeneous catalysis. However, it remains a key challenge to firmly immobilize the catalysts in a facile and flexible manner and to simultaneously maintain a high catalytic efficiency and throughput. Herein, we introduce a dense cylindrical micelle brush support in glass capillary flow reactors through a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly process initiated by pre&#8208;immobilized short micelle seeds. The active hairy corona of these micellar brushes allows the flexible decoration of a diverse array of nanocatalysts, either through a direct capture process or an in situ growth method. The resulting flow reactors reveal excellent catalytic efficiency for a broad range of frequently utilized transformations, including organic reductions, Suzuki couplings, photolytic degradations, and multistep cascade reactions and the system was both recyclable and durable. Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (C&#8208;FRET) for Efficient Chirality Transmission within an Intermolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The occurrence and transmission of chirality is a fascinating characteristic of nature. However, the intermolecular transmission efficiency of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging due to the poor through&#8208;space energy transfer. Here we report a unique CPL transmission from inducing the achiral acceptor to emit CPL within a specific liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based intermolecular system through a circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (  C  &#8208;FRET), wherein the luminescent cholesteric LC is employed as the chirality donor, and rationally designed achiral long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore act as the well&#8208;assembled acceptor. In contrast to photon&#8208;release&#8208;and&#8208;absorption, the chirality transmission channel of  C  &#8208;FRET is highly dependent upon the energy resonance in the highly intrinsic chiral assembly of cholesteric LC, as verified by deliberately separating the achiral acceptor from the chiral donor to keep far beyond the resonance distance. This  C  &#8208;FRET mode provides a de novo strategy concept for high&#8208;level information processing for applications such as high&#8208;density data storage, combinatorial logic calculation, and multilevel data encryption and decryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Nanoparticles for the Deuteration and Tritiation of Benzylic Positions on Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium nanoparticles (PdNp) were revealed as an efficient hydrogen isotope exchange catalyst for the deuterium and tritium labeling of benzylic positions of complex molecules. A practical way to obtain small palladium nanoparticles and to apply them as a catalyst for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is presented. Several model compounds and popular bioactive molecules were submitted to HIE reactions catalyzed by the PdNp. Benzylic positions situated far away from heteroatoms were labeled with high isotopic enrichments. The observed non&#8208;directed HIE gave rise to regioselectivities complementary to those obtained with other methods, which typically require specific directing groups. For this reason, the successful deuteration of a broad variety of benzylic positions created a helpful tool to produce internal LC&#8208;MS standards of complex drugs. Furthermore, this nanocatalyst paved the way for the radiolabeling of drug molecules with high specific activities by using low pressures of tritium gas.</dc:description>

         <title>O&#8208;to&#8208;S Substitution Enables Dovetailing Conflicting Cyclizability, Polymerizability, and Recyclability: Dithiolactone vs Dilactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing chemically recyclable polymers represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration and offers a closed&#8208;loop strategy toward a circular materials economy. However, the synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers is still plagued with certain fundamental limitations, including trade&#8208;offs between the monomer&#8217;s cyclizability and polymerizability, as well as between polymer&#8217;s depolymerizability and properties. Here we describe the subtle O&#8208;to&#8208;S substitution, dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstock  &#945;  &#8208;amino acids can demonstrate appealing chemical properties different from those of dilactone, including accelerated ring closure, augmented kinetics polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity, and thus constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight (up to 100.5 kDa), atactic yet high crystallinity, structurally diversity, and full chemical recyclability. These polythioesters well addresses the formidable challenges of developing chemically recyclable polymers by having an unusual set of desired properties, including easy&#8208;to&#8208;make monomer from ubiquitous feedstock, and high polymerizability, crystallinity and precise tunability of physicochemical performance, as well as high depolymerizability and selectivity. Computational studies explain why O&#8208;to&#8208;S modification of polymer backbone enables dovetailing desirable, but conflicting, performance into one polymer structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and of critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn  2+  probes with K  d  values ranging from 190 nM to 74 &#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn  2+  /insulin co&#8208;released during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn  2+  probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording from isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn  2+  probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt; 100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca  2+  influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets.&#160;The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn&#160;  2+  and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and of critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red- and far-red-emitting Zn  2+  probes with K  d  values ranging from 190 nM to 74 &#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real-time monitoring the high concentration of Zn  2+  /insulin co-released during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine-based Zn  2+  probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long-term live recording from isolated islets. A Si-rhodamine-based Zn  2+  probe with high turn-on ratio (&amp;gt; 100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late-stage N-alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca  2+  influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets.&#160;The time-lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red-shifted Zn&#160;  2+  and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
