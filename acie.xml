         <title>Programmed synthesis of Hepta&#8208;Differentiated &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: 1 out of 117655 Arrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin remain limited. A thioacetate orienting group expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using DIBAL&#8208;H promoted debenzylation. This method allowed the synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. A random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin poly&#8208;functionalization has fueled progress in their use in multiple applications such as enzyme mimicry, but also in the polymer sciences, luminescence, as sensors or for biomedical applications. However, regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is still very limited. We uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, that expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL&#8208;H) promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy, opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;release driven spirocyclization: The expedient and modular construction of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles harnessing the strain energy of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment is described. From easily accessible ABB&#8208;ketones, electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization gives access to a range of spiro&#8208;azetidines with varying functionalities and ring sizes.







Abstract
Due to their intrinsic rigidity, three&#8208;dimensionality and structural novelty, spirocyclic molecules have become increasingly sought&#8208;after moieties in drug discovery. Herein, we report a strain&#8208;release driven synthesis of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles by harnessing the inherent ring strain of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment. Novel ABB&#8208;ketone precursors bearing silyl&#8208;protected alcohols were synthesized in a single step and shown to engage in electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization&#8208;desilylation reactions. Primary, secondary and tertiary silyl ethers were effectively transformed into a library of new spiro&#8208;azetidines, with a range of substituents and ring sizes. In addition, the products are generated with synthetically useful ketone and protected&#8208;amine functional groups, which provides the potential for further elaboration and for this chemistry to be utilized in the rapid assembly of medicinally relevant compounds.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 leads to the formation of a highly emissive, two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8, without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth.







Abstract
Rational syntheses under controllable reducing conditions in the preparation of superatoms with cluster electron number not exceeding two are challenging. Herein a dithiolate&#8208;stabilized two&#8208;electron silver nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8 (1), is isolated via a self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth. 1 is highly fluorescent at ambient temperature and TD&#8208;DFT calculations indicate that the emission is of 1Px&#8594;1S nature.

         <title>Direct Activation of a Remote C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond Enabled by a Visible&#8208;Light Photosensitized Allene Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activations via excited triplet state of allene derivatives have been demonstrated. The reaction mechanisms were investigated by deuterium labeling and kinetic quenching experiments as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
Despite allene derivatives have been always regarded as a radical accepter in traditional radical chemistry for decades, the reactivity of allene derivatives under excited state in radical chemistry was rarely explored. Herein, we wish to report an example to engage triplet&#8208;excited state of allene moiety as hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) partner in the activation of remote sp3 C&#8722;H bond via visible&#8208;light irradiation under mild reaction conditions with broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. The reaction mechanism involving the generation of triplet excited state of allene derivative and the subsequent HAT process was supported by deuterium labeling, kinetic analysis experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>FRET Modulated Signaling: A Versatile Strategy to Construct Photoelectrochemical Microsensors for In Vivo Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imbedding a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system into a photoactive material is a versatile strategy to construct highly selective PEC sensors for diverse targets, no matter electroactive or electrochemically non&#8208;active. Such a FRET modulated PEC microsensor is able to monitor in situ neurochemicals in the brain.







Abstract
Microelectrode&#8208;based electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors are promising candidates for in vivo analysis of biologically important chemicals. However, limited selectivity in complicated biological systems and poor adaptability to electrochemically non&#8208;active species restrained their applications. Herein, we propose the concept of modulating the PEC output by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The emission of energy donor was dependent on the concentration of target SO2, which in turn served as the modulator of the photocurrent signal of the photoactive material. The employment of optical modulation circumvented the problem of selectivity, and the as&#8208;fabricated PEC microelectrode showed good stability and reproducibility in vivo. It can monitor fluctuations of SO2 levels in brains of rat models of cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion and febrile seizure.

     alt="FRET Modulated Signaling: A Versatile Strategy to Construct Photoelectrochemical Microsensors for In Vivo Analysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imbedding a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system into a photoactive material is a versatile strategy to construct highly selective PEC sensors for diverse targets, no matter electroactive or electrochemically non&#8208;active. Such a FRET modulated PEC microsensor is able to monitor in situ neurochemicals in the brain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microelectrode&#8208;based electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors are promising candidates for in vivo analysis of biologically important chemicals. However, limited selectivity in complicated biological systems and poor adaptability to electrochemically non&#8208;active species restrained their applications. Herein, we propose the concept of modulating the PEC output by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The emission of energy donor was dependent on the concentration of target SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which in turn served as the modulator of the photocurrent signal of the photoactive material. The employment of optical modulation circumvented the problem of selectivity, and the as&#8208;fabricated PEC microelectrode showed good stability and reproducibility in vivo. It can monitor fluctuations of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in brains of rat models of cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion and febrile seizure. More significantly, such a FRET modulated signaling strategy can be extended to diverse analytes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Artificial Phase&#8208;Transitional Underwater Bioglue with Robust and Switchable Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based robust bioadhesive was assembled through complex coacervation. The aggregation trend of valine&#8208;rich domains and the change in the backbone conformational states reversibly triggered the phase transition and the enhanced wet adhesion bonding.







Abstract
Complex coacervation enables important wet adhesion processes in natural and artificial systems. However, existed synthetic coacervate adhesives show limited wet adhesion properties, non&#8208;thermoresponsiveness, and inferior biodegradability, greatly hampering their translations. Herein, by harnessing supramolecular assembly and rational protein design, we present a temperature&#8208;sensitive wet bioadhesive fabricated through recombinant protein and surfactant. Mechanical performance of the bioglue system is actively tunable with thermal triggers. In cold condition, adhesion strength of the bioadhesive was only about 50&#8197;kPa. By increasing temperature, the strength presented up to 600&#8197;kPa, which is remarkably stronger than other biological counterparts. This is probably due to the thermally triggered phase transition of the engineered protein and the formation of coacervate, thus leading to the enhanced wet adhesion bonding.

         <title>Uncovering a Functional Motif of Nonlinear Optical Materials by In Situ Electron Density and Wavefunction Studies Under Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy of determining nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motif (FM) is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. In situ ED analysis is firstly adopted for an NLO material with typical LiB3O5 as an example. The work extracts the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of in situ ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.







Abstract
Exploring nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motifs (FM, the structural origin of NLO efficiency) is vital for the rational design of NLO materials. Normal spectrum techniques applied in studying photon exciting materials are invalid for NLO materials, in which electrons are not excited substantially but only distorted under laser. A general strategy of determining NLO FM is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. The in situ experimental ED and wavefunction of typical NLO material LiB3O5 (LBO) under dark and 360 and 1064&#8197;nm lasers are investigated. Compared with the initial state under dark, the ED of [B3O5]&#8722; unit at functional states under laser irradiation exhibits remarkable changes of topological atomic and bond properties, confirming the NLO FM being [B3O5]&#8722;. The work extracts for the first time the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of in situ ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Methylation of Alkyl Iodides with CO as the C1 Source: Advantaged by Faster Reaction of CuH over CuBpin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source is reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.







Abstract
CuH and CuBpin are versatile catalysts and intermediates in organic chemistry. However, studies that involve both CuH and CuBpin in the same reaction is still rarely reported due to their high reactivity. Now, a study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source is reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversible Surfactant&#8208;Induced Transformation Between Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions and Pickering Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emulsion was stabilized by silica particles in combination with a charge&#8208;reversible surfactant, which can be converted between anionic, zwitterionic and cationic forms by pH trigger. Not only can rapid demulsification be achieved, but the emulsion can also be reversibly switched between an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion and a Pickering emulsion. This strategy endows the emulsion with the capacity for intelligent and precise control of stability as well as viscosity and droplet size.







Abstract
A novel charge&#8208;reversible surfactant, (CH3)2N&#8208;(CH2)10COONa, was designed and synthesized, which together with silica nanoparticles can stabilize a smart n&#8208;octane&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion responsive to pH. At high pH (9.3) the surfactant is anionic carboxylate, which together with the negatively charged silica nanoparticles co&#8208;stabilize flowable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions, whereas at low pH (4.1) it is turned to cationic form by forming amine salt which can hydrophobize in situ the negatively charged silica nanoparticles to stabilize viscous oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) Pickering emulsions. At neutral pH (7.5), however, this surfactant is converted to zwitterionic form, which only weakly hydrophobises the silica particles to stabilize O/W Pickering emulsions of large droplet size. Moreover, demulsification can be achieved rapidly triggered by pH. With this strategy particles can be controlled either dispersed in water or adsorbed at the oil&#8208;water interface endowing emulsions with the capacity for intelligent and precise control of stability as well as viscosity and droplet size.

         <title>Alcohol Dehydrogenases and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I) Catalysts: Design of a Chemoenzymatic Cascade towards Optically Active &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concurrent process involving a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (IPrAuNTf2) and an alcohol dehydrogenase is described for the first time. This cascade approach allows the development of a Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement for the transformation of racemic propargylic alcohols, mostly with good selectivities towards the corresponding E&#8208;allylic ketone intermediates, in aqueous medium, which are subsequently reduced to obtain the desired alcohol enantiomers with excellent optical purities.







Abstract
The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis is used in a two&#8208;step approach, including Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of a series of readily available propargylic alcohols followed by stereoselective bioreduction of the corresponding allylic ketone intermediates, to provide optically pure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted allylic alcohols. This cascade involves a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and an enzyme, demonstrating the compatibility of both catalyst types in aqueous medium under mild reaction conditions. The combination of [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2) and a selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH&#8208;A from Rhodococcus&#8197;ruber, KRED&#8208;P1&#8208;A12 or KRED&#8208;P3&#8208;G09) led to the synthesis of a series of optically active (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ols in good yields (65&#8211;86&#8201;%). The approach was also extended to various 2&#8208;hetarylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, hexynol, and butynol derivatives.

     alt="Alcohol Dehydrogenases and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I) Catalysts: Design of a Chemoenzymatic Cascade towards Optically Active &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Alcohols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concurrent process involving a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (IPrAuNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and an alcohol dehydrogenase is described for the first time. This cascade approach allows the development of a Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement for the transformation of racemic propargylic alcohols, mostly with good selectivities towards the corresponding &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;allylic ketone intermediates, in aqueous medium, which are subsequently reduced to obtain the desired alcohol enantiomers with excellent optical purities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis is used in a two&#8208;step approach, including Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of a series of readily available propargylic alcohols followed by stereoselective bioreduction of the corresponding allylic ketone intermediates, to provide optically pure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted allylic alcohols. This cascade involves a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and an enzyme, demonstrating the compatibility of both catalyst types in aqueous medium under mild reaction conditions. The combination of [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH&#8208;A from &lt;i&gt;Rhodococcus&#8197;ruber&lt;/i&gt;, KRED&#8208;P1&#8208;A12 or KRED&#8208;P3&#8208;G09) led to the synthesis of a series of optically active (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ols in good yields (65&#8211;86&#8201;%). The approach was also extended to various 2&#8208;hetarylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, hexynol, and butynol derivatives. The use of alcohol dehydrogenases of opposite selectivity led to the production of both allyl alcohol enantiomers (93&#8208;&amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) for a broad panel of substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ligand Non&#8208;innocence and Single Molecular Spintronic Properties of AgII Dibenzocorrole Radical on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dibenzo&#8208;fused silver corrole (Ag&#8208;1) was synthesized and its electronic state on Ag(111) substrate was studied by STM. Ag&#8208;1 adopted an unprecedented domed geometry with two orientations. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center, were observed by STS, which provide the first spectroscopic evidence for open&#8208;shell AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722;.







Abstract
A facile method for the quantitative preparation of silver dibenzo&#8208;fused corrole Ag&#8208;1 is described. In contrast to the saddle conformation resolved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis for Ag&#8208;1, it adopts an unprecedented domed geometry, with up and down orientations, when adsorbed on an Ag(111) surface. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center were observed by cryogenic STM, with relatively high Kondo temperature (172&#8197;K), providing evidence for a non&#8208;innocent AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722; species. Further investigation validates that benzene ring fusion and molecule&#8208;substrate interactions play pivotal roles in enhancing Ag(4d(x2&#8722;y2))&#8211;corrole (&#960;) orbital interactions, thereby stabilizing the open&#8208;shell singlet AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722; on Ag(111) surface. Moreover, this strategy used for constructing metal&#8208;free benzene&#8208;ring fused corrole ligand gives rise to inspiration of designing novel metal&#8211;corrole compound for multichannel molecular spintronics devices.

         <title>Reversible Ratiometric NADH Sensing Using Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, rapid analytical method for NADH sensing is achieved by electron transfer from a Pdot to NADH upon UV excitation. Ratiometric NADH detection using DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots exhibits high sensitivity, excellent selectivity versus other analytes, and a fast and reversible response. Smartphone&#8208;based in vivo ratiometric imaging of NADH is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.







Abstract
Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is a key coenzyme in living cells due to its role as an electron carrier in redox reactions, and its concentration is an important indicator of cell metabolic state. Abnormal NADH levels are associated with age&#8208;related metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, creating a demand for a simple, rapid analytical method for point&#8208;of&#8208;care NADH sensing. Here we develop a series of NADH&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) as nanoprobes for NADH measurement, and test their performance in vitro and in vivo. NADH sensing is based on electron transfer from semiconducting polymer chains in the Pdot to NADH upon UV excitation, quenching Pdot fluorescence emission. In polyfluorene&#8208;based Pdots, this mechanism resulted in an on&#8208;off NADH sensor; in DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots, UV excitation resulted in NADH&#8208;sensitive emission at two wavelengths, enabling ratiometric detection. Ratiometric NADH detection using DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots exhibits high sensitivity (3.1&#8197;&#956;M limit of detection), excellent selectivity versus other analytes, reversibility, and a fast response (less than 5&#8197;s). We demonstrate applications of the ratiometric NADH&#8208;sensing Pdots including smartphone&#8208;based NADH imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <title>Endogenous Symbiotic Li3N/Cellulose Skin to Extend the Cycle Life of Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective electrolyte was designed via adding nitrocellulose (NC) in ether electrolyte to form an endogenous symbiotic Li3N/cellulose double solid electrolyte interphase (ES&#8208;DSEI) on Li surface. An ES&#8208;DSEI with a uniform dual&#8208;layer provides excellent chemical and physical stability and high ionic conductivity.







Abstract
Nitrocellulose (NC) is proposed to stabilize the electrolytes for Li metal batteries. The nitro group of NC preferentially reacts with Li metal, and along with the cellulose skeleton is tightly wrapped on the surface, so that the polymer&#8211;inorganic double layer is formed on the Li surface. XPS profile analysis and corroborative cryo&#8208;environmental TEM reveal that the flexible outer layer of the bilayer is a C&#8208;O organic layer, while the dense inner layer is mainly composed of crystalline lithium oxide, lithium oxynitride, and lithium nitride. The Li deposition process was observed via in situ optical microscopy, which indicated that the NC&#8208;derived bilayer facilitates the uniform deposition of Li ions and inhibits the growth of dendrites. After the introduction of NC into the electrolyte, the cycle life of the Li battery is twice than that of the Li battery without NC at 1.0 and 3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <dc:description>O&#8208;O bond formation with Ru(bda)L  2  &#8208;type catalysts is well&#8208;known to proceed through a bimolecular reaction pathway, limiting the potential application of these catalyst at low concentrations.

         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an attractive approach to convert renewable electricity into fuels and feedstocks in the form of chemical bonds. Among the different CO2RR pathways, CO2 conversion to carbon monoxide (CO) is considered as one of the most promising candidate reactions in the chemical industry due to its high technologically and economically feasibility. Integrating catalyst and electrolyte design with understanding of catalytic mechanism will yield scientific insights and promote this technology towards industrial implementation. Herein, we review recent advances and challenges for selective CO2 conversion to CO. The intelligent multidimensional catalyst and electrolyte engineering for CO2RR are comprehensively summarized. Furthermore, recent efforts on large&#8208;scale production of CO are provided so as to facilitate the industrialization of electrochemical CO2 reduction. To conclude, the remaining technological challenges and future direction of industrialized application of CO2RR to CO are put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Dual Co/Organophotoredox Catalyzed Stereoselective Synthesis of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and attractive Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis protocol has been developed allowing the stereoselective access to a wide variety of syn&#8208;configured 1,3&#8208;diols featuring

quaternary carbon centers. The synthesis of the target molecules is achieved under ambient reaction conditions using modular and accessible reagents, substituted vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes, in short reaction times. Mechanistic control experiments

suggest that the stereoselectivity can be rationalized via a preferred Zimmerman&#8208;Traxler transition state comprising a Co(allyl) species and activated aldehyde. This newly developed process thus expands the use of base metal catalysis in the construction of challenging quaternary carbon stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Nanoparticles with Programable Intermolecular Charge Transfer for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CT NPs) with programmable absorption can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II regions via donor and acceptor engineering. CT NPs with red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040&#8197;nm achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm excitation, and thus effectively kill both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Extensive recent efforts have been put on the design of high&#8208;performance organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs), especially over NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;window (1000&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). So far, the development is mainly limited by the rarity of molecules with good NIR&#8208;II response. Here, we report organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs) with easily programmable optical absorption. By employing different common donor and acceptor molecules to form CTC nanoparticles (CT NPs), absorption peaks of CT NPs can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region. Notably, CT NPs formed with perylene and TCNQ have a considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040&#8197;nm and achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm excitation. These nanoparticles were used for antibacterial application with effective activity towards both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This work opens a new avenue into the development of efficient PTAs.

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Cell&#8211;Matrix and Cell&#8211;Cell Junctions by Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thickness of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) layer can be modulated by rationally regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or co&#8208;reactant to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions, thus allowing the spatially selective ECL imaging of cell&#8211;matrix adhesions at the bottom and cell&#8211;cell junctions near the apical surface of cells.







Abstract
Cell junctions are protein structures located at specific cell membrane domains that determine key processes in multicellular development. Here we report spatially selective imaging of cell junctions by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or co&#8208;reactant, the thickness of ECL layer can be controlled to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions. At a low concentration of luminophore, ECL generation is confined to the electrode surface, thus revealing only cell&#8211;matrix adhesions at the bottom of cells. While at a high concentration of luminophore, the ECL layer can be remarkably extended by decreasing the co&#8208;reactant concentration, thus allowing the sequential imaging of cell&#8211;matrix and cell&#8211;cell junctions at the bottom and near the apical surface of cells, respectively. This strategy not only provides new insights into the ECL mechanisms but also promises wide applications of ECL microscopy in bioimaging.

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Total Synthesis of C&#8208;11 Oxygenated Cephalotaxus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collective asymmetric total synthesis of C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids was accomplished. This synthesis features sequential chirality transfer steps such as a diastereoselective N&#8208;alkylation, a stereospecific Stevens rearrangement and an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. A series of oxidation state adjustments from a common intermediate led to the asymmetric total synthesis of six C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids.







Abstract
While numerous studies pertaining to the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus alkaloids have been reported, only two strategies have been reported to date for the successful synthesis of the C&#8208;11 oxygenated subset, due to the additional synthetic challenge posed by the remote C&#8208;11 stereocenter. Herein, we report the collective asymmetric total synthesis of C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids using a chiral proline both as a starting material and as the only chirality source. A tetracyclic advanced intermediate was synthesized in a highly stereoselective manner from l&#8208;proline in 8 steps involving sequential chirality transfer steps such as a diastereoselective N&#8208;alkylation, stereospecific Stevens rearrangement and intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction via an unusual O&#8208;acyloxocarbenium intermediate. From a common intermediate, the asymmetric total synthesis of six C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids was completed by a series of oxidation state adjustments.

         <title>Structure Sensitivity of Au&#8208;TiO2 Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on the Au NP size and the TiO2 facet. Supported Au NPs with a size of ca. 5&#8197;nm are more facile to undergo the Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI than those of ca. 2&#8197;nm, and the TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than the TiO2{101} facets.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate that the Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on both Au nanoparticle (NP) sizes and TiO2 facets. Au NPs of ca. 5&#8197;nm are more facile undergo Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI than those of ca. 2&#8197;nm, while TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than TiO2{101} facets. The resulting capsulating TiO2&#8722;x overlayers on Au NPs exhibit an average oxidation state between +3 and +4 and a Au&#8208;to&#8208;TiO2&#8722;x charge transfer, which, combined with calculations, determines the Ti:O ratio as ca. 6:11. Both TiO2&#8722;x overlayers and TiO2&#8722;x&#8208;Au interface exhibit easier lattice oxygen activation and higher intrinsic activity in catalyzing low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation than the starting Au&#8208;TiO2 interface. These results advance fundamental understanding of SMSI and demonstrate engineering of metal NP size and oxide facet as an effective strategy to tune the SMSI for efficient catalysis.

Au NPs of ca. 5&#8197;nm are more facile undergo Au&#8208;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SMSI than those of ca. 2&#8197;nm, while TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {001} and {100} facets are more facile than TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{101} facets. The resulting capsulating TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers on Au NPs exhibit an average oxidation state between +3 and +4 and a Au&#8208;to&#8208;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; charge transfer, which, combined with calculations, determines the Ti:O ratio as ca. 6:11. Both TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Au interface exhibit easier lattice oxygen activation and higher intrinsic activity in catalyzing low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation than the starting Au&#8208;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface. These results advance fundamental understanding of SMSI and demonstrate engineering of metal NP size and oxide facet as an effective strategy to tune the SMSI for efficient catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlling Oxygen Reduction Selectivity through Steric Effects: Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron and Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction with Cobalt Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt porphyrin atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects were synthesized. One isomer is selective for the 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, one is selective for the 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, while the other two show poor selectivity for either 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Achieving a selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical but challenging. Herein, we report controlling ORR selectivity of Co porphyrins by tuning only steric effects. We designed Co porphyrin 1 with meso&#8208;phenyls each bearing a bulky ortho&#8208;amido group. Due to the resulted steric hinderance, 1 has four atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. Isomers &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; catalyze ORR with n=2.10 and 3.75 (n is the electron number transferred per O2), respectively, but &#945;&#945;&#946;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#946; show poor selectivity with n=2.89&#8211;3.10. Isomer &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; catalyzes 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by preventing a bimolecular O2 activation path, while &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; improves 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR selectivity by improving O2 binding at its pocket, a feature confirmed by spectroscopy methods, including O K&#8208;edge near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. This work represents an unparalleled example to improve 2&#8201;e&#8722; and 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by tuning only steric effects without changing molecular and electronic structures.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Bioconjugation with Bifunctional Palladium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linking life's molecules: Rapid and site&#8208;selective oligonucleotide bioconjugation via bifunctional oxidative addition complexes (OACs) is reported. These bifunctional OACs react chemoselectively with amine&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to generate isolable oligonucleotide OACs. Within minutes, the oligonucleotide OACs undergo a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;S arylation reaction with a broad range of native thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules.







Abstract
Organometallic reagents enable practical strategies for bioconjugation. Innovations in the design of water&#8208;soluble ligands and the enhancement of reaction rates have allowed for chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling reactions of peptides and proteins to be carried out in water. There are currently no organometallic&#8208;based methods for oligonucleotide bioconjugation to other biomolecules. Here we report bifunctional palladium(II)&#8208;oxidative addition complexes (OACs) as reagents for high&#8208;yielding oligonucleotide bioconjugation reactions. These bifunctional OACs react chemoselectively with amine&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to generate the first isolable, bench stable oligonucleotide&#8208;palladium(II) OACs. These complexes undergo site&#8208;selective C&#8208;S arylation with a broad range of native thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules at low micromolar concentrations in under one hour. This approach provided oligonucleotide&#8208;peptide, oligonucleotide&#8208;protein, oligonucleotide&#8208;small molecule, and oligonucleotide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates in &gt;80&#8201;% yield and afforded conjugation of multiple copies of oligonucleotides onto a monoclonal antibody.

         <title>Polysulfates block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 uptake via electrostatic interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report that negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 via electrostatic interactions. Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC  50  ) of 67 &#956;g/mL (approx. 1.6 &#956;M). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60&#8208;fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC  50  : 4084 &#956;g/mL), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind stronger to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Iron/Cobalt Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrathin MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets (2.2&#8197;nm) can be prepared via stirring at room temperature by precise control of solvent. The 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets show an excellent OER activity, which was caused by its abundant unsaturated coordinated metal sites and the synergistic effect of iron and cobalt. The high OER activity of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets is further supported by the DFT calculations.







Abstract
A facile synthesis is reported of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bimetallic (Fe/Co=1:2) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF, ca. 2.2&#8197;nm thick) via simple stirring of the reaction mixture of Fe/Co salts and 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;BDC) in the presence of triethylamine and water at room temperature. The mechanism of the 2D, rather than bulk, MOF was revealed by studying the role of each component in the reaction mixture. It was found that these 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under basic conditions. The electrocatalytic mechanism was disclosed via both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The 2D morphology and co&#8208;doping of Fe/Co contributed to the superior OER performance of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2). The simple and efficient synthetic method is suitable for the mass production and future commercialization of functional 2D MOF with low cost and high yield.

&lt;p&gt;The ultrathin MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets (2.2&#8197;nm) can be prepared via stirring at room temperature by precise control of solvent. The 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets show an excellent OER activity, which was caused by its abundant unsaturated coordinated metal sites and the synergistic effect of iron and cobalt. The high OER activity of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets is further supported by the DFT calculations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile synthesis is reported of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bimetallic (Fe/Co=1:2) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF, ca. 2.2&#8197;nm thick) via simple stirring of the reaction mixture of Fe/Co salts and 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;BDC) in the presence of triethylamine and water at room temperature. The mechanism of the 2D, rather than bulk, MOF was revealed by studying the role of each component in the reaction mixture. It was found that these 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under basic conditions. The electrocatalytic mechanism was disclosed via both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The 2D morphology and co&#8208;doping of Fe/Co contributed to the superior OER performance of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2). The simple and efficient synthetic method is suitable for the mass production and future commercialization of functional 2D MOF with low cost and high yield.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Single&#8208;handed Double Helix and Spiral Platelet Formed by Racemate of Dissymmetric Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since Pasteur&#8217;s seminal work, spontaneous deracemization or symmetry breaking has been applied to separate homochiral domains from the erstwhile racemic system. However, the resulting homochirality can only be referred to when the scales of these domains and systems are specified. To clarify this notion, we report on the self&#8208;assembly of racemates of dissymmetric cages  DC&#8208;1  with a cone&#8208;shape propeller geometry, forming a centrosymmetric columnar crystalline phase,  namely racemic at crystallographic level  . Due to their anisotropic geometry, the two enantiomers are packed in a frustrated fashion within this crystalline phase, in which single&#8208;handed double helices are observed,  i.e.  ,  single&#8208;handedness at supramolecular level  . The frustrated packing, or layer continuity break&#8208;up, in turn facilitates screw dislocation during the crystal growth, forming left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed spiral platelets, namely  symmetry&#8208;breaking at morphological level  , even though each platelet is composed of  DC&#8208;1  racemates. We also demonstrated the symmetry correlation between  DC&#8208;1  molecules, the corresponding crystalline phase and spiral platelets, all exhibiting a  C  3  &#8208;symmetry. This work might provide new insight into the relationship between racemization, symmetry&#8208;breaking and homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;amplified CRET nanoparticles for in vivo imaging of tumor metastatic lymph nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noninvasive imaging strategies have been extensively investigated for in vivo mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, the current imaging strategies fail to accurately assess tumor metastatic status in SLNs with high sensitivity. Here we report pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles, which integrate chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) and signal amplification strategy, enabling accurate identification of metastatic SLNs. After draining into lymph nodes, the nanoparticles were phagocytosed and dissociated in acidic phagosomes of inflammatory macrophages to emit near&#8208;infrared luminescent light. Using these nanoparticles, we successfully differentiated tumor metastatic lymph nodes from benign ones. These nanoparticles also exhibited excellent imaging capability for early detection of metastatic SLNs in diverse animal tumor models with small tumor volume (100&#8208;200 mm3).</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Borane&#8211;Olefin Proximity Interaction Governing the Structure and Reactivity of Boron&#8208;Containing Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While attractive interactions between borane and olefin have been postulated to trigger various boron&#8208;mediated organic transformations, proximity structures of these functional groups, other than the formation of weak van der Waals complexes, have never been directly observed. Here we show that a close intramolecular borane&#8208;olefin interaction operates in macrocyclic systems containing borane and olefinic groups obtained by multi&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;carboboration between a strained alkyne and 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives. Depending on Lewis acidity of the borane moiety and the size of the macrocycles, the magnitude of interaction changes, resulting in different reaction modes. The whole picture of the multi&#8208;step reactions has been revealed experimentally with theoretical supports. The present finding may not only provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental boron&#8208;mediated interaction but also lead to the development of new organic transformations involving molecular activation by boranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Network Analysis Enabled Divergent Syntheses and Structure Revision of Pentacyclic Cytochalasans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We accomplished the divergent total syntheses of ten pentacyclic cytochalasans (aspergillin PZ, trichodermone, trichoderones, flavipesines, and flavichalasines) from a common precursor aspochalasin D and revised the structures of trichoderone B, spicochalasin A, flavichalasine C, aspergilluchalasin based on structure network analysis of the cytochalasans biosynthetic pathways and DFT calculations. The key steps of the syntheses include transannular alkene/epoxyalkene and carbonyl&#8208;  ene  cyclizations to establish the C/D ring of pentacyclic aspochalasans. Our bioinspired approach to these pentacyclic cytochalasans validate the proposed biosynthetic speculation in chemical view and provide a platform for the synthesis of more than 400 valuable cytochalasans bearing different macrocycles and amino&#8208;acid residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their unique afterglow ability, long wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (PersL) nanoparticles (PLNPs) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes. In particular, long wavelength LED light has been shown to be effective in recharging these nanoparticles. However, finding a simple and effective method to amplify such renewable PersL signals under long wavelength light is still a key challenge. Herein, we discovered that a dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was able to effectively boost the renewable PersL signals of the NIR emitting ZnGa  2  O  4  :Cr  3+  (ZGC)) under long wavelength LED light. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle tumorectomy demonstration, this new class of dye sensitized ZGC enabled simultaneous intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and effective microscopic detection of tumor cells in pathological diagnosis. Thus, this work will offer a simple way to the development of PLNPs with enhanced luminescence and provides new opportunities for a wide variety of biophotonic and photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has advanced medical imaging and image&#8208;guided interventions during the past three decades. However, despite major advances in imaging instrumentation, only a few dyes are currently available in the clinic. Previously, we reported two zwitterionic NIR fluorophores, ZW800&#8208;1A and ZW800&#8208;1C, which significantly improved the poor performance of the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green. However, ZW800&#8208;1A is not stable in serum and ZW800&#8208;1C induces severe stacking in aqueous media. To solve such dilemmas, ZW800&#8208;PEG was designed by introducing a flexible yet stable thiol PEG linker.  ZW800&#8208;PEG shows high solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, thus improving renal clearance with minimal binding to serum proteins during systemic circulation. The sulfide group on the meso position of the heptamethine core improves serum stability and physicochemical properties including the maximum emission wavelength shift to 800 nm, enabling the use of ZW800&#8208;PEG for image&#8208;guided interventions and  augmenting  photothermal therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vibration&#8208;Induced Emision&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemosensor for the Selective and Visual Recognition of Glucose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemosensors to detect analytes in biologically relevant solutions is a challenging task . We report the synthesis of a fluorescent receptor that combines&#160; vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) and dynamic covalent chemistry for the detection of glucose in aqueous media. We &#160;show that&#160; the bis&#8208; 2&#8208;(  N  &#8208;methylaminomethyl) phenylboronic acid&#8208;decorated&#160;  N  ,  N  &#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[  a  ,  c  ]phenazine &#160;(DPAC)&#160; receptor&#160;  1  &#160;can detect glucose and discriminat e between closely related monosaccharides including those commonly found in blood. Preliminary studies suggest monosaccharides bind to the DPAC&#8208;receptor with a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce pseudomacrocyclic complexes, which in turn leads to distinct optical changes in the fluorescent emission of the receptor for each host. Moreover, the complexation&#8208;induced change in emission can be both detected visually and quantified in a ratiometric way. Our results highlight the potential of VIE&#8208;type receptors for the development of&#160; improved tools for the quantitative determination of saccharides in biological samples where a single chemosensor can discriminate between similarly related structures in aqueous solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Single Crystals of Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Oligomer Frameworks Synthesized under Kinetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, various robust, crystalline, and porous organic frameworks based on in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed imine&#8208;linked oligomers were investigated; these oligomers self&#8208;assembled through collaborative intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions via liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial reactions. The soluble oligomers were kinetic products with multiple unreacted aldehyde groups that acted as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and directed the assembly of the resulting oligomers into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. The sequential formation of robust covalent linkages and highly reversible hydrogen bonds enforced long&#8208;range symmetry and facilitated the production of large single crystals, with structures that were unambiguously determined and refined based on high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Impressively, the unique hierarchical arrangements increased the steric hindrance of the imine bond, which prevented attacks from water molecules, thereby greatly improving the stability. Furthermore, the multiple binding sites in the resultant frameworks enabled the rapid sequestration of micropollutant in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of a peptide &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;methyltransferase to methylate non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of&#160;&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;methylated non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids into peptides can improve their biological activities, membrane permeability and proteolytic stability. This is commonly achieved, in nature and in the lab, by assembling pre&#8208;methylated amino acids. The more appealing route of methylating amide bonds is challenging. Biology has evolved an&#160;&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;automethylating enzyme, OphMA, which acts on the amide bonds of peptides fused to its C&#8208;terminus. Due to the ribosomal biosynthesis of its substrate, the activity of this enzyme towards peptides with non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids has not been addressed. An engineered OphMA, intein&#8208;mediated protein ligation and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis have allowed us to demonstrate the methylation of amide bonds in the context of non&#8208;natural amides. This approach may have application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;linked Cyclopentadienyl Rh(III) Complexes&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;Diazonaphthoquinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral CpRh complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions have witnessed a significant progress in organic synthesis. In sharp contrast, the reported chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands are rather limited to C&#8208;linked Cp and often synthetically challenging. To address these issues, we have developed a novel class of tunable chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing oxygen linkers, which are found to be efficient catalysts for C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[  h  ]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones, affording axially chiral heterobiaryls in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield, 98.5:1.5 er). Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to proceed by electrophilic C&#8722;H activation, and followed by coupling of the cyclometalated rhodium(III) complex with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of External Surface Diffusion Barriers on Pt/Beta Catalyzed Isomerization of n&#8208;Pentane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite crystals contain transport barriers on their external surface that hinder molecular uptake and processes that depend on it, such as catalysis and separations. However, the potentially dominant role of surface barriers in such processes is only emerging. In this work, we have developed a generalizable strategy to quantify the effect of surface barriers on zeolite catalysis. Isomerization of  n  &#8208;pentane, catalyzed by Pt/Beta, is taken as a model reaction system. Firstly, the surface modification by chemical liquid deposition of SiO  2  was carried out to control the surface barriers on zeolite Beta crystals. The deposition of SiO  2  leads to a very slight change in the physical properties of Beta crystals, but an obvious reduction in Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Diffusion measurements by the zero&#8208;length column (ZLC) method show that the apparent diffusivity of  n  &#8208;pentane can be more than doubled after SiO  2  deposition, indicating that the surface barriers have been weakened. Catalytic performance was tested in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor, showing that the apparent catalytic activity improved by 51&#8211;131% after SiO  2  deposition. These results provide direct proof that reducing surface barriers can be an effective route to improve zeolite catalyst performance deteriorated by transport limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Coating the Right Polymer: Achieving Ideal Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Particle Dispersibility in Polymer Matrixes Using a Coordinative Crosslinking Surface Modification Method.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>According to the rule &#8220;like dissolves like&#8221;, the best way to improve the dispersibility of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles in a polymer matrix is to modify the MOF surface with the same polymer as the matrix.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to the rule &#8220;like dissolves like&#8221;, the best way to improve the dispersibility of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles in a polymer matrix is to modify the MOF surface with the same polymer as the matrix.

         <title>Development of continuous flow systems to access secondary amines through previously incompatible biocatalytic cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key aim of biocatalysis is to mimic the ability of eukaryotic cells to carry out multistep cascades in a controlled and selective way. As biocatalytic cascades get more complex, reactions become unattainable under typical batch conditions. Here a number of continuous flow systems were used to overcome batch incompatibility, thus allowing for successful biocatalytic cascades. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, reactive carbonyl intermediates were generated  in situ  using alcohol oxidases, then passed directly to a series of packed&#8208;bed modules containing different aminating biocatalysts which accordingly produced a range of structurally distinct amines. The method was expanded to employ a batch incompatible sequential amination cascade  via  an oxidase/transaminase/imine reductase sequence, introducing different amine reagents at each step without cross reactivity. The combined approaches allowed for the biocatalytic synthesis of the natural product 4O&#8208;methylnorbelladine. The flow biocatalysis platform shown here significantly increases the scope of novel biocatalytic cascades, removing previous limitations due to reaction and reagent batch incompatibility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid&#8208;derived meroterpenoids (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone A and its five congeners ((&#8722;)&#8208;preaustinoids A, A1, B, B1 and B2) in 12&#8208;15 steps, respectively, starting from commercially available 2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzoic acid hydrate.

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination from Low ee Compounds by the Crystalline Sponge Method. Unusual Conglomerate Formation in a Pre&#8208;Determined Crystalline Lattice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No need for ee enrichment: When a low ee chiral compound (even 17&#8201;% ee!) is absorbed into the pre&#8208;determined crystalline lattice of the crystalline sponge, the analyte forms an enantiomerically pure [RmSn] aggregate, validating the Bijvoet method for the absolute structure analysis with a reasonable Flack (Parsons) parameter value.







Abstract
When chiral compounds with low enantiomeric excess (ee, R:S=m:n) were absorbed into the void of the crystalline sponge (CS), enantiomerically pure [(R)m(S)n] chiral composites were formed, changing the centrosymmetric space group into non&#8208;centrosymmetric one. The absolute configuration of the analyte compounds was elucidated with a reasonable Flack (Parsons) parameter value. This phenomenon is characteristic to the &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; in the pre&#8208;determined CS crystalline lattice, seldom found in common crystallization where the crystalline lattice is defined by an analyte itself. The results highlight the potential of the CS method for absolute configuration determination of low ee samples, an often encountered situation in asymmetric synthesis studies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic design to afford smart functional biomaterials with exquisite properties represents synthetic challenges and provides unique perspectives. In this context, elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) recently became highly attractive building blocks in the development of lipoprotein&#8208;based membranes. In addition to the bioengineered post&#8208;translational modifications of genetically encoded recombinant ELPs developed so far, we report here a simple and versatile method to design biohybrid brush&#8208;like lipid&#8208;grafted&#8208;ELPs using chemical post&#8208;modification reactions. We have explored a combination of methionine alkylation and click chemistry to create a new class of hybrid lipoprotein mimics. Our design allowed the formation of biomimetic vesicles with controlled permeability, correlated to the temperature&#8208;responsiveness of ELPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single fluorinated agent for multiplexed 19F&#8208;MRI&#160;with&#160;micromolar&#160;detectability based on dynamic exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins limits the sensitivity of MRI, even for MR&#8208;sensitive nuclei as fluorine&#8208;19. Therefore, despite being the source of inspiration for the development of background&#8208;free MRI for various applications, including for multiplexed imaging, the inability to map very low concentrations of targets using&#160;  19  F&#8208;MRI raises the need to further enhance this platform&#8217;s capabilities. Here, we employ the principles of CEST&#8208;MRI in&#160;  19  F&#8208;MRI to obtain a 900&#8208;fold signal amplification of a biocompatible fluorinated agent, which can be presented in a &#8220;multicolor&#8221; fashion. Capitalizing on the dynamic interactions in host&#8208;guest supramolecular assemblies in an approach termed GEST, we demonstrate that an inhalable fluorinated anesthetic can be used as a single&#160;  19  F&#8208;probe for the concurrent detection of micromolar levels of two targets, with potential&#160;  in&#8208;vivo  &#160;translatability. Further extending GEST with new designs could expand the applicability of&#160;  19  F&#8208;MRI to the mapping of targets that have so&#8208;far remained non&#8208;detectable.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Oxygenation of Hydrocarbons by Mono&#8208;&#181;&#8208;oxo Dicopper(II) Species Resulting from O&#8208;O Cleavage of Tetranuclear Cu(I)/Cu(II) Peroxo Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the big challenges of catalysis is the transformation of inert C&#8208;H bonds to useful products. Copper&#8208;containing monooxygenases play an important role in this regard, as exemplified by the enzyme pMMO which in methanotrophic bacteria converts methane to methanol. Here we show that low&#8208;temperature oxygenation of dinuclear copper(I) complexes leads to unusual tetranuclear, mixed&#8208;valent  &#181;  4  &#8208;peroxo [Cu(I)/Cu(II)]  2  complexes. These  Cu  4  O  2  intermediates promote irreversible and thermally activated O&#8208;O bond homolysis, generating  Cu  2  O  complexes that catalyze strongly exergonic H&#8208;atom abstraction from hydrocarbons, coupled to O&#8208;transfer.

         <title>Large&#8208;area crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework thin films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although considerable progress achieved, further development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) films is still facing the formidable challenge of upscaling, which hampers their practical applications in diverse areas such as molecular separation, sensing, microelectrics and catalysis. Here we show that continuous MOF films with highly controlled thickness (from 44 to 5100 nm) can be deposited over length scales greater than 80 centimeters by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating method. Such success relies on our discovery of unprecedented perfectly&#8208;dispersed colloidal solutions consisting of amorphous MOF nanoparticles, which we adopted as precursors that readily converted to the crystalline films upon low&#8208;temperature in situ heating. Importantly, the colloidal solutions allow for the fabrication of compact and uniform MOF films on a great deal of substrates such as fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO), glass, SiO  2  , Al  2  O  3  , Si, Cu, and even flexible polycarbonate, widening their technological applications where substrates are essential. Despite the present work focuses on the fabrication of uniform cobalt&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)  2  and zinc&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)  2  films, our findings mark a great possibility in producing other high&#8208;quality MOF thin films on a large scale.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the oxidation of olefins to ketones using either tris(dibenzoylmethanato)iron(III) [Fe(dbm)  3  ] or a combination of iron(II) chloride and neocuproine (2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) as catalysts and phenylsilane PhSiH  3  as additive. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature using air as sole oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, is operationally simple, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and shows a high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ketones are formed smoothly in up to 97&#160;% yield and with 100&#160;% regioselectivity for ketone formation, while the corresponding alcohols were observed as by&#8208;products. Labeling experiments showed that an incorporated hydrogen atom originates from the phenylsilane. The oxygen atom of the ketone as well as of the alcohol derives from the ambient atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Practical Separation of Cyclic and Linear Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can discriminate topological architectures of macromolecules, such as linear and cyclic structures, via selective polymer insertion into the nanopores. This realizes new polymer separation technology that enables practical and efficient isolation of cyclic polyethylene glycols (PEGs) from the chaotic mixture with linear impurities in a gram scale.







Abstract
The purification step in the manufacturing of cyclic polymers is difficult as complete fractionation to eliminate linear impurities requires considerable effort. Here, we report a new polymer separation methodology that uses metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to discriminate between linear and cyclic polyethylene glycols (PEGs) via selective polymer insertion into the MOF nanopores. Preparation of a MOF&#8208;packed column allowed analytical and preparative chromatographic separation of these topologically distinct pairs. In addition, gram&#8208;scale PEGs with only cyclic structures were successfully obtained from a crude reaction mixture by using MOF as an adsorbent.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Intermolecular Interaction in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Ultralong Life Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dense interfacial Li+ conduction pathways between garnet fillers and polymer matrix via the open&#8208;ring reaction of ethylene carbonate initiated by LiOH/Li2CO3 contaminant on LLZTO is reported, which results in the superior ionic conductivity of composite electrolytes at room temperature and long lifespan of assembled solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries built with composite polymer electrolytes using cubic garnets as active fillers are particularly attractive owing to their high energy density, easy manufacturing and inherent safety. However, the uncontrollable formation of intractable contaminant on garnet surface usually aggravates poor interfacial contact with polymer matrix and deteriorates Li+ pathways. Here we report a rational designed intermolecular interaction in composite electrolytes that utilizing contaminants as reaction initiator to generate Li+ conducting ether oligomers, which further emerge as molecular cross&#8208;linkers between inorganic fillers and polymer matrix, creating dense and homogeneous interfacial Li+ immigration channels in the composite electrolytes. The delicate design results in a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.43&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and an unprecedented 1000&#8197;cycles with 90&#8201;% capacity retention at room temperature is achieved for the assembled solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;based trimetallic spinel oxide nanoboxes are synthesized through an elaborate strategy involving chemical etching, cation exchange and thermal oxidation processes. The unique structural and compositional advantages endow the trimetallic NiCo2&#8722;xFexO4 nanoboxes with superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The development of efficient and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for improving the efficiency of several electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Here, we report an elaborate design and synthesis of porous Co&#8208;based trimetallic spinel oxide nanoboxes (NiCo2&#8722;xFexO4 NBs) by a novel metal&#8208;organic framework engaged strategy, which involves chemical etching, cation exchange, and subsequent thermal oxidation processes. Owing to the structural and compositional advantages, the optimized trimetallic NiCo2&#8722;xFexO4 NBs (x is about 0.117) deliver superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 274&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline electrolyte, which is much better than that of Co&#8208;based bi/monometallic spinel oxides and even commercial RuO2.

         <title>Efficient Nitrogen Fixation to Ammonia through Integration of Plasma Oxidation with Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformation of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is a long&#8208;sought goal for human being. However, present one&#8208;step N2 fixation is impeded by tough activation of the N&#8801;N bond and low selectivity to NH3. Here we report fixation of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 can be advantageously decoupled to a two&#8208;step process with one problem solved independently and effectively in each step, including: 1) facile activation of N2 to NOx&#8211; by a non&#8208;thermal plasma technique, and; 2) highly selective conversion of NOx&#8211; to NH3 by electrocatalytic reduction. Importantly, this process uses air and water as low&#8208;cost raw materials for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions. For NOx&#8211; reduction to NH3 we present a novel surface boron&#8208;rich core&#8208;shell nickel boride electrocatalyst. Combining a series of physical characterizations and in situ spectrometric measurements, we reveal that the surface boron&#8208;rich feature is the key to boosting activity, selectivity, and stability via enhanced NOx&#8211; adsorption, and suppression of hydrogen evolution and surface Ni oxidation. Consequently, a highly significant ammonia production of 198.3 &#181;mol h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 was achieved, together with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;pronged pulmonary gene delivery strategy: a surface&#8208;modified fullerene nanoparticle and a hypotonic vehicle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inhaled gene therapy poses a unique potential of curing chronic lung diseases which are currently managed primarily by symptomatic treatments. However, it has been challenging to achieve therapeutically&#8208;relevant gene transfer efficacy in the lung thus far due to the presence of numerous biological delivery barriers. Here, we introduce a simple combinatorial approach that overcomes both extracellular and cellular barriers to enhance gene transfer efficacy in the lung  in vivo  . We have endowed tetra(piperazino)fullerene epoxide (TPFE)&#8208;based nanoparticles with non&#8208;adhesive surface polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings, thereby enabling the nanoparticles to percolate the airway mucus gel layer and obviate phagocytic uptake by alveolar macrophages. In parallel, we have utilized a hypotonic vehicle to facilitate endocytic uptake of the PEGylated nanoparticles by lung parenchymal cells via the osmotically&#8208;driven regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanism. We demonstrate here that this two&#8208;pronged delivery strategy provides safe, wide&#8208;spread and high&#8208;level transgene expression in the lungs of both healthy mice and mice with chronic lung diseases characterized by reinforced delivery barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Uranyl Superoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high radiation field associated with spent nuclear fuel (U(IV)O  2  ) pellets produces an array of reactive radical species that impact the corrosion and formation of secondary alteration phases. Dioxygen radicals are important as radiolysis products, but the interaction between these reactive oxygen species and U(VI)O  2  2+  and its effects on the resultant alteration phases is unclear. Herein, we report the first example of a U(VI) superoxide compound and explore its reactivity in the environments relevant to the storage of spent nuclear fuel. We utilized X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman scattering techniques to demonstrate that the uranyl superoxide reacts with CO  2  in air to afford a mixed uranyl peroxide/carbonate within 3 days, both in solution and under atmospheric conditions. An additional transformation occurs over the course of three months to form a potassium U(VI) carbonate (grimselite), which also occurs as an alteration product on Chernobyl corium. Our results demonstrate the presence and significance of the superoxide anion in the alteration of spent nuclear fuel and indicate the impact of uranyl superoxide chemistry on high prevalence of carbonate in the secondary phases of spent nuclear fuel.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human anamorsin is an iron&#8208;sulfur (Fe&#8208;S) cluster binding protein acting as an electron donor in the early steps of cytosolic iron&#8208;sulfur protein biogenesis. Human anamorsin belongs to the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family and contains two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs each binding an Fe&#8208;S cluster.  In vitro  works by various groups has provided rather controversial results for the type of Fe&#8208;S clusters bound to the CIAPIN1 proteins. In order to solve this debate, we exploited an  in cellulo  approach combining M&#1255;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies to characterize the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster bound form of human anamorsin. We found that the protein binds two [2Fe&#8208;2S] clusters at both its cysteine&#8208;rich motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;second Time&#8208;resolved Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Reveals Dynamic CO Intermediates during Electrochemical CO2&#160;Reduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added products (e.g., ethylene) is a promising approach for greenhouse gas mitigation, but many details of electrocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction reactions (CO2RR) remain elusive. Raman spectroscopy is suitable for&#160;in situ&#160;characterization of CO2RR mechanisms, but the low signal intensity and resulting poor time resolution (often up to minutes) hampers the application of conventional Raman spectroscopy for the study of the dynamic CO2&#160;reduction reaction, which requires sub&#8208;second time resolution. By using&#160;Time&#8208;Resolved Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) we were able to successfully monitor CO2RR over Cu surfaces with sub&#8208;second time resolution.&#160;Anodic treatment at 1.55 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and subsequent surface oxide reduction (below &#8722;0.4 V vs. RHE) induced roughening of the Cu electrode surface, which resulted in hot&#8208;spots for TR&#8208;SERS, enhanced time resolution (down to ~ 0.7 s) and improved CO2RR efficiency (i.e., four&#8208;fold increase in ethylene faradaic efficiency). With TR&#8208;SERS, the initial formation of hot&#8208;spots for SERS and CO2RR was followed (&lt;7 s), after which a stable copper surface surrounded by increased local alkalinity was formed. Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060 cm&#8722;1, is related to C&#8208;C coupling and ethylene production (&#8722;0.9 V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (&#8722;0.7 V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092 cm&#8722;1. Our results provide valuable time&#8208;resolved insights into the dynamic nature of the electrode surface and adsorbed intermediates during CO2&#160;electrochemical reduction on copper and showcase the potential of TR&#8208;SERS in copper&#8208;based electrocatalysis to follow reaction dynamics.</dc:description>

Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060 cm&#8722;1, is related to C&#8208;C coupling and ethylene production (&#8722;0.9 V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (&#8722;0.7 V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092 cm&#8722;1. Our results provide valuable time&#8208;resolved insights into the dynamic nature of the electrode surface and adsorbed intermediates during CO2&#160;electrochemical reduction on copper and showcase the potential of TR&#8208;SERS in copper&#8208;based electrocatalysis to follow reaction dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of oligosaccharide antigens for semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccine leads against Streptococcus suis serotypes 2, 3, 9 and 14</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus suis  bacteria are one of the most serious health problems for pigs and an emerging zoonotic agent in humans working in the swine industry.  S. suis  bacteria express capsular polysaccharides (CPS) a major bacterial virulence factor that define the serotypes. Oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of  S. suis  serotypes 2, 3, 9, and 14 have been synthesized, glycans related to serotype 2 and 9 were placed on glycan array surfaces to screen blood from infected pigs. Lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic  S. suis  serotype 2 and 9 glycoconjugate veterinary vaccines were identified in this way.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobispyrazole family as photoswitches combining (near&#8208;) quantitative bidirectional isomerization and widely tunable thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzenes are classical molecular photoswitches that have received widespread application. In recent endeavors of molecular design, replacing one or both phenyl rings by heteroaromatic ones is emerging as a strategy to expand the molecular diversity and access improved photoswitch properties. Many mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo molecules with unique structure/properties have been developed, but the potential of bis&#8208;heteroaryl architecture is&#160;  far&#160;from&#160;exploited  . Here we report a family of azobispyrazoles, which combine (near&#8208;)quantitative bidirectional photoconversion and widely tunable  Z  &#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years. The two five&#8208;membered rings remarkably weaken the intramolecular steric hindrance, providing new possibilities for the engineering geometric and electronic structure of azo photoswitches. Azobispyrazoles generally exhibit twisted  Z  &#8208;isomers that facilitate complete  Z  &#8594;  E  photoisomerization, and their thermal stability can be adjusted independently of geometric shape, overcoming the conflict between effective photoconversion (favored by twisted shape) and  Z  &#8208;isomer stability (favored by T shape) encountered by mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder Dimerization of ortho&#8208;Quinols in Natural Product (Bio)Synthesis &#8211; Bioinspired Chemical 6&#8208;Step Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Maytenone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many natural products of plant or microbial origins are derived from enzymatic dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenolic precursors into 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienones. These so&#8208;called ortho&#8208;quinols cyclodimerize via a remarkably selective bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Whether or not the intervention of catalytic or dirigent proteins is involved during this final step of the biosynthesis of these natural products, this cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols can be chemically reproduced in the laboratory with the same strict level of site&#8208;specific regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This unique yet unified process, which finds its rationale in the inherent chemical reactivity of those ortho&#8208;quinols, is illustrated herein by an efficient and bioinspired first chemical synthesis of one of the most structurally complex and synthetically challenging examples of such natural cyclodimers, the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8208;H Phosphonylation of Indoles at the C4 and C6 Positions via a Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8208;H activation of indole benzenoid moiety has been achieved in the past decade. However, palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C&#8208;H activation of indoles is really rare. Herein, we report a challenging palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C4&#8208;H phosphonylation of indoles via a radical approach. The method provides access to a series of C4&#8208;phosphonylated indoles, including tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;containing dipeptides, which are typically inaccessible by direct C4&#8208;H activation due to its heavy reliance on C3 directing groups. Notably, unexpected C6&#8208;phosphonylated indoles were obtained through blocking of the C4 position. The preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reactions may proceed via a C7&#8208;palladacycle/remote&#8208;activation process. Based on the strategy, examples of remote C4&#8208;H difluoromethylation with BrCF  2  COOEt are also presented, suggesting that the strategy may offer a general blueprint for other cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Beam Irradiation Induced Formation of Defect&#8208;Rich Zeolites under Ambient Condition With Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites are a well&#8208;known family of microporous aluminosilicate crystals with a wide range of industrial applications. Their industrial synthetic method under hydrothermal condition requires elevated temperature for activation of polymerization reaction and a long crystallization time, and is therefore quite energy&#8208;consuming. Herein, for the first time, we utilize high&#8208;energy ionizing irradiation (1.5 MeV electron beam) generated by an industrial electron beam accelerator as a distinct type of energy source to activate the formation reaction of Na&#8208;A zeolite. The initial efforts afford an attractive reaction process that can be achieved under ambient conditions and completed within minutes with almost quantitative yield, leading to notable energy&#8208;saving of one order of magnitude compared to the hydrothermal reaction. More importantly, electron beam irradiation simultaneously exhibits an etching effect during the formation of zeolite generating a series of crystal&#8208;defects and additional pore windows that can be controlled by accumulative irradiation dose. These observations give rise to significantly enhanced surface area and heavy metal removal capabilities in comparison with Na&#8208;A zeolite synthesized hydrothermally. Finally, we show that this method can be applied to many other types of zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Compartmenting poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids for efficient live&#8208;cell microRNA capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct delivery of exogenous non&#8208;coding nucleic acids into living cells has attracted intense interest in biological applications. However, the cell entry efficiency and target capture ability remain to be improved. Here we develop a method for compartmenting poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (polyA&#8208;SNAs) for efficient capture of oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) in living cells. We find that polyA&#8208;SNAs exhibit high cell entry efficiency insensitive to the configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences. By programming the length of polyAs, we precisely engineer the spatial configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences in polyA&#8208;SNAs. Compartmentalized polyA&#8208;SNAs bind to miRNAs with improved capture ability as compared to densely compacted SNAs. We further demonstrate that polyA&#8208;SNAs serve as high&#8208;efficacy miRNA sponges for capturing oncogenic miRNAs both in living cells and in mice. The efficient inhibition of miRNAs results in significant suppression of tumor growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Macropinocytosis&#8208;Inducing Peptide Potentiated by Medium&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Disulfide Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marcopinocytosis is as a ubiquitous cellular delivery route. A short macropinocytosis&#8208;inducing peptide P4A is identified that undergoes thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction, yielding a potent intramolecular oxidized analogue (oxP4A). The conjugate of oxP4A and the membrane lytic peptide LK15 delivered functional proteins. This peptide delivers proteins fused with a supernegatively charged protein tag at nanomolar concentrations.







Abstract
Macropinocytosis is a ubiquitous cellular uptake mechanism of peptide&#8208;based intracellular delivery. This entry pathway shows promise as a route for the intracellular uptake of biomacromolecules and nanoparticles. In this work, we obtained the 8&#8208;residue analogue P4A bearing higher macropinocytosis induction ability. P4A contains vital cysteine residues in its sequence, which immediately reacts with cystine in culture medium to convert into its oxidized forms, including the intramolecularly oxidized form (oxP4A) as the dominant and active species. The conjugate of oxP4A and the membrane lytic peptide LK15 delivered bioactive proteins into cells; notably, this peptide delivered functional proteins fused with a negatively charged protein tag at a significantly reduced amount (up to nanomolar range) without compromising the delivery efficiency and the cellular activities of delivered proteins.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Storage Enhanced a&#8208;Si Photocathodes for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An outstanding PEC performance of amorphous silicon photocathode is reported with a record 15.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, the maximum ABPE of 4.08&#8201;%, and a sustained operation for 175&#8197;min for hydrogen production with 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency in harsh alkaline media. This remarkable performance is made possible by ferrihydrite interfacial engineering which facilitates the electron transfer to the surface Ni cocatalyst but blocks the holes.







Abstract
Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated as an effective interfacial layer for photoanodes to achieve outstanding photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance for water oxidation reaction owing to its unique hole&#8208;storage function. However, it is unknown whether such a hole&#8208;storage layer can be used to construct highly efficient photocathodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we report Fh interfacial engineering of amorphous silicon photocathode (with nickel as HER cocatalyst) achieving a photocurrent density of 15.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode and a half&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 4.08&#8201;% in alkaline solution, outperforming most of reported a&#8208;Si based photocathodes including multi&#8208;junction configurations integrated with noble metal cocatalysts in acid solution. Besides, the photocurrent density is maintained above 14&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 175&#8197;min with 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for HER in alkaline solution. Our results demonstrate a feasible approach to construct efficient photocathodes via the application of a hole&#8208;storage layer.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Benzothiophene/Benzofuran&#8208;Fused Biaryls via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Arene Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryl scaffolds are prevalent in natural products, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. However, NHC&#8208;catalyzed de novo  construction of aromatic ring with concomitant axially chiral induction for the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers is far less developed, and the efficient synthesis of axially chiral tetra&#8208; ortho  &#8208;substituted biaryls remains an unsolved problem under NHC catalysis.  Herein, we report an NHC&#8208;catalyzed de novo  synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls  from enals and 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes through a cascade strategy of [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. The developed method provides an efficient and general access to novel axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls in high enantioselectivities and works well for the synthesis of tetra&#8208; ortho  &#8208;substituted biaryls.</dc:description>

         <title>Physical Separation of H2 Activation from Hydrogenation Chemistry Reveals the Specific Role of Secondary Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;selective palladium membrane enables reactive hydrogen formation and substrate hydrogenation to occur on separate metals at the opposing surface of the palladium membrane. This electrochemical platform was used to demonstrate that gold is an active hydrogenation catalyst if not burdened with forming reactive hydrogen.







Abstract
An electrocatalytic palladium membrane reactor (ePMR) uses electricity and water to drive hydrogenation without H2 gas. The device contains a palladium membrane to physically separate the formation of reactive hydrogen atoms from hydrogenation of the unsaturated organic substrate. This separation provides an opportunity to independently measure the hydrogenation reaction at a surface without any competing H2 activation or proton reduction chemistry. We took advantage of this feature to test how different metal catalysts coated on the palladium membrane affect the rates of hydrogenation of C=O and C=C bonds. Hydrogenation occurs at the secondary metal catalyst and not the underlying palladium membrane. These secondary catalysts also serve to accelerate the reaction and draw a higher flux of hydrogen through the membrane. These results reveal insights into hydrogenation chemistry that would be challenging using thermal or electrochemical hydrogenation experiments.

         <title>Stereoselective Diboration of Spirocyclobutenes: A Platform for the Synthesis of Spirocycles with Orthogonal Exit Vectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclobutenes provide a platform for the preparation of chiral spirocycles, through the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective diboration of the double bond. Selective manipulation of the boryl moieties in the products allows unique control on the directionality and nature of the substituents on the spirocycle framework.







Abstract
The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective diboration of spirocyclobutenes provides a platform for the rapid preparation of a wide variety of chiral spirocyclic building blocks. The chemoselective functionalization of the carbon&#8208;boron bond in the products, including a stereospecific sp3&#8208;sp2 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, provides a powerful tool to control the directionality and the nature of the exit vectors in the spirocyclic framework.

         <title>Reversible Supra&#8208;Folding of User&#8208;Programmed Functional DNA Nanostructures on Fuzzy Cationic Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
User&#8208;defined DNA nanostructures (origamis, nanogrids) undergo an astonishing higher&#8208;order folding transition, referred to as supra&#8208;folding, when they adsorb on soft cationic polymeric surfaces. Upon addition of a competitive anionic polyelectrolyte, supra&#8208;folded origamis unfold back to their original shape with preserved structural features and site&#8208;specific functionality (tethered function or protein).







Abstract
We report that user&#8208;defined DNA nanostructures, such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) origamis and nanogrids, undergo a rapid higher&#8208;order folding transition, referred to as supra&#8208;folding, into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) compact structures (origamis) or well&#8208;defined &#956;m&#8208;long ribbons (nanogrids), when they adsorb on a soft cationic substrate prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. Once supra&#8208;folded, origamis can be switched back on the surface into their 2D original shape through addition of heparin, a highly charged anionic polyelectrolyte known as an efficient competitor of DNA&#8208;polyelectrolyte complexation. Orthogonal to DNA base&#8208;pairing principles, this reversible structural reconfiguration is also versatile; we show in particular that 1)&#8197;it is compatible with various origami shapes, 2)&#8197;it perfectly preserves fine structural details as well as site&#8208;specific functionality, and 3)&#8197;it can be applied to dynamically address the spatial distribution of origami&#8208;tethered proteins.

         <title>Direct Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H and Vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H Thiolation with Hydrogen Evolution by Quantum Dots and Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic thiolation of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H or vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H with thiol S&#8722;H is reported for the first time. The radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H or vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H with thiol S&#8722;H is achieved with liberation of H2. Such a unique transformation opens up a door toward direct cross&#8208;coupling of C&#8722;H and S&#8722;H bonds in valuable organosulfur chemistry.







Abstract
Direct allylic C&#8722;H thiolation is straightforward for allylic C(sp3)&#8722;S bond formation. However, strong interactions between thiol and transition metal catalysts lead to deactivation of the catalytic cycle or oxidation of sulfur atom under oxidative condition. Thus, direct allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H thiolation has proved difficult. Represented herein is an exceptional for direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic thiolation of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H and thiol S&#8722;H under visible light irradiation. Radical trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy identified the allylic radical and thiyl radical generated on the surface of photocatalyst quantum dots (QDs). The C&#8722;S bond formation does not require external oxidants and radical initiators, and hydrogen (H2) is produced as byproduct. When vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H was used instead of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, the radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of C(sp2)&#8722;H and S&#8722;H was achieved with liberation of H2. Such a unique transformation opens up a door toward direct C&#8722;H and S&#8722;H coupling for valuable organosulfur chemistry.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Giant Conjugated Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have achieved an on&#8208;surface synthesis of giant conjugated macrocycles of diameter ~7 nm consisting of up to 30 subunits. The synthesis was initiated from a debrominative coupling of the molecular precursors occurring on a hot Ag(111) surface, leading to the formation of arched oligomeric chains and macrocycles. These products, revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density functional theory, were covalent oligomers assisted by C&#8208;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits, due to a site&#8208;selective debromination and the asymmetric molecular conformation. A consecutive cyclodehydrogenation activated by thermal treatments at higher temperatures steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles. Our finding provides a novel design strategy toward &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, and opens up new opportunities for precise synthesis of organic nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Lamellar Tetrapotassium Pyromellitic Organic for Robust High&#8208;Capacity Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic (K4PM) for a K&#8208;organic battery delivers a high capacity and excellent cycling robustness due to its four K+ ion storage sites and large layer distance with reversible rearrangement of conjugated carboxyls into enolates.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active organics are investigation hotspots for metal ion storage due to their structural diversity and redox reversibility. However, they are plagued by limited storage capacity, sluggish ion diffusion kinetics, and weak structural stability, especially for K+ ion storage. Herein, we firstly reported the lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic (K4PM) with four active sites and large interlayer distance for K+ ion storage based on a design strategy, where organics are constructed with the small molecular mass, multiple active sites, fast ion diffusion channels, and rigid conjugated &#960; bonds. The K4PM electrode delivers a high capacity up to 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, among the best reported organics for K+ ion storage.

&lt;p&gt;The lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic (K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PM) for a K&#8208;organic battery delivers a high capacity and excellent cycling robustness due to its four K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion storage sites and large layer distance with reversible rearrangement of conjugated carboxyls into enolates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox&#8208;active organics are investigation hotspots for metal ion storage due to their structural diversity and redox reversibility. However, they are plagued by limited storage capacity, sluggish ion diffusion kinetics, and weak structural stability, especially for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion storage. Herein, we firstly reported the lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic (K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PM) with four active sites and large interlayer distance for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion storage based on a design strategy, where organics are constructed with the small molecular mass, multiple active sites, fast ion diffusion channels, and rigid conjugated &#960; bonds. The K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PM electrode delivers a high capacity up to 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, among the best reported organics for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion storage. Especially, it achieves an excellent rate capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability with a capacity retention of &#8776;83&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. Incorporating in situ and ex&#8208;situ techniques, the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion storage mechanism is revealed, where conjugated carboxyls are reversibly rearranged into enolates to stably store K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This work sheds light on the rational design and optimization of organic electrodes for efficient metal ion storage.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Linking the Dynamic Chemical State of Catalysts with the Product Profile of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical link between the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites (mixed Cu+&#8208; and Cu0&#8208;, Cu+&#8208;, and Cu0&#8208;dominated) and their unique selectivity toward the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (yielding C2H4/C2H5OH, CO/HCOO&#8722;, and CH4, respectively) is put forward. This may be a valuable tool for finetuning the Cu surface state toward distinct CO2RR pathways.







Abstract
The promoted activity and enhanced selectivity of electrocatalysts is commonly ascribed to specific structural features such as surface facets, morphology, and atomic defects. However, unraveling the factors that really govern the direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is still very challenging since the surface state of electrocatalysts is dynamic and difficult to predict under working conditions. Moreover, theoretical predictions from the viewpoint of thermodynamics alone often fail to specify the actual configuration of a catalyst for the dynamic CO2RR process. Herein, we re&#8208;survey recent studies with the emphasis on revealing the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites under CO2RR conditions extracted by in situ/operando characterizations, and further validate a critical link between the chemical state of Cu and the product profile of CO2RR. This point of view provides a generalizable concept of dynamic chemical&#8208;state&#8208;driven CO2RR selectivity that offers an inspiration in both fundamental understanding and efficient electrocatalysts design.

         <title>Origins of Endo Selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Cyclic Allene Dienophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strained cyclic allenes, first discovered in 1966 by Wittig and coworkers, have recently emerged as valuable synthetic building blocks.&#160;Previous experimental investigations, and computations reported here, demonstrate that the&#160;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of furans and pyrroles to 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene and oxa and aza heterocyclic analogs proceed&#160;with&#160;  endo  selectivity. This unprecedented&#160;  endo  selectivity gives the adduct with the allylic saturated carbon of the cyclic allene&#160;  endo  to the diene carbons.The selectivity is very general and useful in synthetic applications. Ourcomputational study establishes the origins of this&#160;  endo  selectivity. We analyze the helical frontier molecular orbitals of strained cyclic allenes and show how secondary orbital and electrostatic effects influence stereoselectivity. The LUMO of carbon&#8208;3 of the allene (C&#8208;3 is not involved in primary orbital interactions) interacts in a stabilizing fashion with the HOMO of the diene in such a way that the carbon of the cyclic allene attached to C&#8208;1 favors the&#160;  endo  position in the transition state. The furan LUMO, allene HOMO interaction reinforces this preference. These mechanistic studies are expected to prompt the further use of long&#8208;avoided strained cyclic allenes in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Quality Control Assay for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries of Macrocycles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of high&#8208;quality libraries of macrocycles from conformationally restricted precursors is a challenge due to the variable cyclization rates of different linear molecules. Here we report a powerful assay for on&#8208;resin analysis of the cyclization efficiency of thousands of non&#8208;peptidic thioether macrocycles in the context of a DNA&#8208;encoded library.







Abstract
There is considerable interest in the development of libraries of scaffold&#8208;diverse macrocycles as a source of ligands for difficult targets, such as protein&#8211;protein interaction surfaces. A classic problem in the synthesis of high&#8208;quality macrocyclic libraries is that some linear precursors will cyclize efficiently while some will not, depending on their conformational preferences. We report here a powerful quality control method that can be employed to readily distinguish between scaffolds that do and do not cyclize efficiently during solid&#8208;phase synthesis of thioether macrocycles without the need for tedious liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. We demonstrate that this assay can be employed to identify linear impurities in a DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocycles. We also use the method to establish a useful quality control protocol for re&#8208;synthesis of putative macrocyclic screening hits.

         <title>Highly Curved Nanostructure&#8208;Coated Co, N&#8208;Doped Carbon Materials for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel onion&#8208;like carbon&#8208;nanosphere&#8208;coated Co, N&#8208;doped carbon (OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) material was reported for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C exhibits excellent ORR/OER activity and Zn&#8208;air battery performance than Co&#8208;N&#8208;C without OLC structure. Highly curved OLC is beneficial for adsorption of intermediates during ORR/OER process comparing with their analogues in un&#8208;curved graphene.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene could catalyze the electrochemical reduction and evolution of oxygen, but unfortunately suffers from sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, for the first time, we report an onion&#8208;like carbon coated Co, N&#8208;doped carbon (OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) material, which possesses multilayers of highly curved nanostructures that form mesoporous architectures. These unique nanospheres are produced when surfactant micelles are introduced to synthesis precursors. Owing to the combined electronic effect and nanostructuring effect, our OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C materials exhibit high bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity, showing a promising application in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Experimental results are rationalized by theoretical calculations, showing that the curvature of graphitic carbon plays a vital role in promoting activities of meta&#8208;carbon atoms near graphitic N and ortho/meta carbon atoms close to pyridinic N.

         <title>Enhanced Ultrasound Contrast of Renal&#8208;Clearable Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with both pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and aggregation properties are designed to achieve significantly reabsorption and in situ aggregation of AuNPs in tubular cells of injured kidneys to show enhanced ultrasound signals toward synergetic fluorescence and ultrasound diagnosis of early kidney injury with precise anatomical information.







Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles are typically fast eliminated through the free glomerular filtration, which show weak interaction with the renal compartments and negligible ultrasound signals, raising challenges in direct imaging of kidney diseases. Here, we report the ultrasmall renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with both pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and aggregation properties, and discover that enhanced ultrasound contrast could be facilely acquired through the increased tubular reabsorption and in situ aggregation of AuNPs in renal tubule cells in injured kidneys.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with both pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and aggregation properties are designed to achieve significantly reabsorption and in situ aggregation of AuNPs in tubular cells of injured kidneys to show enhanced ultrasound signals toward synergetic fluorescence and ultrasound diagnosis of early kidney injury with precise anatomical information.

         <title>Tailored Synthesis of Skeletally Diverse Stemona Alkaloids through Chemoselective Dyotropic Rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collective synthesis of skeletally diverse  Stemona  alkaloids has been achieved, featuring tailored dyotropic rearrangements of b &#8208;lactones as key elements. Specifically, three typical 5/7/5 tricyclic skeletons associated with stemoamide, tuberostemospiroline and parvistemonine were first accessed through chemoselective alkyl&#8208;, hydrogen&#8208;, and aryl&#8208;migration dyotropic rearrangements of b &#8208;lactones, respectively. With rational manipulations of substrate structures and reaction conditions, these dyotropic rearrangements proceeded with excellent efficiency, good chemoselectivity and high stereospecificity. Furthermore, several polycyclic  Stemona  alkaloids including saxorumamide, isosaxorumamide, stemonine and bisdehydroneostemoninine were obtained from the aforementioned tricyclic skeletons through late&#8208;stage derivatization. Along the total synthesis tour, a novel visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition was also developed, which offers a valuable tool for accessing oxaspirobutenolide and related scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Persistent peri&#8208;Heptacene: Synthesis and In&#8208;Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;peri&#8208;Acenes (n&#8208;PAs) have gained enormous interest as fundamental model systems of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons for the potential applications in synthetic carbon nanoelectronics and spintronics. However, the synthesis of n&#8208;PAs larger than peri&#8208;tetracene (4&#8208;PA) remains challenging because of their intrinsic open&#8208;shell character and high reactivity. Herein, we present the synthesis of a hitherto unknown n&#8208;PA, i.e., peri&#8208;heptacene (7&#8208;PA), by a rational molecular design strategy, in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected with eight 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups. The successful formation of  7&#8208;PA  from its tetrahydro&#8208;precursor  3  is clearly validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. The resultant  7&#8208;PA  displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01 eV and exhibits a persistent stability (half&#8208;life, t  1  /2  ~ 25 min) under inert conditions. Moreover, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements and theoretical studies reveal that  7&#8208;PA  exhibits an open&#8208;shell feature and a significant tetraradical character (y  0  = 1.0 and y  1  = 0.2). This synthetic strategy could be considered as a modular approach for the construction of next generation (3N+1)&#8208;PAs (where N = 3, 4, etc.).</dc:description>

         <title>The origin of catalytic benzylic C&#8208;H oxidation over a redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8208;H compounds to ketones is important for the production of a wide range of fine chemicals, and is often achieved using toxic or precious metals catalysts. Here, we report the efficient oxidation of benzylic C&#8208;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions over a robust metal&#8208;organic framework material, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. A comprehensive investigation employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction has identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (t&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaction of the cobalt(I) complex [(TIMMN  mes  )Co  I  ](BPh  4  ) (  2  ) (TIMMN  mes  =  t  ris  &#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesityl&#8208;  im  idazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;  m  ethyl]&#173;ami  n  e) with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide yields the cobalt(III) imido complex [(TIMMN  mes  )Co  III  (NAd)](BPh  4  ) (  3  ) with concomitant release of dinitro&#173;gen. The  N  &#8208;anchor in diamagnetic  3  features an unusual, planar tertiary amine, which results from repulsive electro&#173;static interaction with the cobalt ion&#8217;s filled  d  (  z  2  ) orbital and negative hyperconjugation with the neighboring methylene groups. One&#8208;electron oxidation of  3  with [FeCp  2  ][OTf] provides access to the rare, high valent cobalt(IV) imido complex [(TIMMN  mes  )Co  IV  &#173;(NAd)](OTf)  2  (  4  ). Both complexes  3  and  4  were fully characterized. Despite a half&#8208;life of less than one hour at room temperature,  4  could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form.

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimide (AABI), which is a nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low&#8208;lying LUMO level (&#8211;4.1 eV vs. vacuum). Single&#8208;electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which is stable under ambient conditions. The photoconductivity measurement suggests that the intrinsic electron mobility of an&#160;N&#8208;phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, the single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) device achieved an electron mobility of 0.90 cm2&#160;V&#8211;1&#160;s&#8211;1.&#160;The vacuum&#8208;deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited a high electron mobility of up to 0.27 cm2&#160;V&#8211;1&#160;s&#8211;1&#160;even in air.

         <title>Enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization for the synthesis of quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinazolinones are common substructures in molecules of medicinal importance. We report an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization for the assembly of privileged pyrroloquinazolinone motifs. The reaction proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol, and can deliver products containing quaternary stereocenters. The utility of the products is demonstrated through further manipulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Aliphatic Fluorides via Reductive C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monofluorinated alkyl compounds are of great importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Herein, we describe a direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoromethylation of unactivated alkyl halides using a low cost industrial raw material, bromofluoromethane, by demonstrating a general and efficient reductive cross&#8208;coupling of two alkyl halides. Results with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;fluoroalkane also demonstrate the viability of monofluoroalkylation, which further established the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations demonstrate high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Mechanistic studies support a radical pathway. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction is first&#8208;order dependence on catalyst and alkyl bromide while the generation of monofluoroalkyl radical is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step. This strategy provides a general and efficient method for the synthesis of aliphatic fluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation&#8208;controlled redox reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the era of molecular devices and nanotechnology, precise control over electron&#8208;transfer processes is strongly desired. However, redox reactions are usually characterized by reaction equilibrium constants strongly departing from unity. This leads to strong favoring of either reactants or products and does not permit subtle control of transferred charge (doping). Here we propose, based on theoretical calculations for periodic systems, how charge transfer between reactants could be finely manipulated in the epitaxially grown system composed of extremely strong oxidizer, reducing agent, and an inert separator &#8211; the key factor of control.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Compensated Pre&#8208;metallation Strategy for Metal&#8208;ion Battery and Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sacrificial cathode additive as a pre&#8208;metallation method could ensure adequate metal sources for advanced energy storage devices. However, this pre&#8208;metallation technique is seriously suffered from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre&#8208;metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been successfully achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of oxygen&#8208;metal (O&#8208;M) moiety. As theoretically predicted, the electron&#8208;donating effect of substituent and low charge density of cation can dramatically weaken the O&#8208;M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre&#8208;sodiation feature for sodium&#8208;ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8 mAh g &#8208;1  , remarkably delivering 70. 6% enhanced capacity retention after 100 cycles. Notably, this elaborate methodology has been profoundly extended to construct high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion battery and lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion capacitor. This breakthrough has paved an innovative pathway for pre&#8208;metallation enabled by organic electrochemistry, offering in&#8208;depth insights into directional design of sacrificial reagent for electrochemical energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N bond formation reactions via acylnitrene transfer have recently attracted much attention, but direct detection of the proposed acylnitrenoid/acylimido M(NCOR) (R = aryl or alkyl) species in these reactions poses a formidable challenge. Herein we report on Ru(NCOR) intermediates in C&#8208;N bond formation catalyzed by [Ru  IV  (Por)Cl  2  ]/N  3  COR, a catalytic method applicable to aziridine/oxazoline formation from alkenes, amination of substituted indoles, &#945;&#8208;amino ketone formation from silyl enol ethers, amination of C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds, and functionalization of natural products and carbohydrate derivatives (up to 99% yield). Experimental studies including HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EPR measurements, coupled with DFT calculations, lend evidence for the formulation of the Ru(NCOR) acylnitrenoids as a Ru  V  &#8208;imido species.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of 16&#960; Antiaromatic 2,7&#8208;Dihydrodiazapyrenes: Antiaromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons with Embedded Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the two&#8208;electron reduction of  N  ,  N&#8217;  &#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diazapyrenium dications (  MDAP  2+  ), which afforded the corresponding reduced form (  MDAP  0  ) as a highly electron&#8208;rich 16&#960; antiaromatic system. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of  MDAP  0  revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with high bond&#8208;length alternation. The  1  H NMR spectrum of  MDAP  0  exhibited a diagnostic proton signal (4.6 ppm) that is distinctly upfield shifted compared to that of aromatic diazapyrene (8.3 ppm). Theoretical calculations supported the existence of a paratropic ring current. These results indicate that  MDAP  0  exhibits antiaromatic character derived from its peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Cancer Meroterpenoids Dysideanone B and Dysiherbol A and Structural Reassignment of Dysiherbol A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer meroterpenoids dysideanone B and dysiherbol A have been accomplished in a divergent way. The synthetic route features: 1) a site and stereoselective  &#945;  &#8208;position alkylation of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone derivative with a   bulky benzyl bromide  to join the terpene and aromatic moieties together and set the stage for subsequent cyclization reactions; 2) an intramolecular radical cyclization to construct the 6/6/6/6&#8208;tetracycle of dysideanone B and an intramolecular Heck reaction to forge the 6/6/5/6&#8208;fused core structure of dysiherbol A, respectively. A late&#8208;stage introduction of the ethoxy group in dysideanone B reveals that this group might come from the solvent ethanol. The structure of dysiherbol A has been revised based on our chemical total synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;controlled Tyrosine Nitration of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine nitration of proteins represents one of the most important oxidative post&#8208;translational modifications  in vivo  and is closely related to human physiology, pathology and aging. A major obstacle for its biochemical and physiological studies is the lack of efficient and chemoselective protein tyrosine nitration reagents. Herein, we report a generalizable strategy for light&#8208;controlled protein tyrosine nitration by employing biocompatible dinitroimidazole reagents. Upon 390 nm irradiation, dinitroimidazoles efficiently convert tyrosine residues into 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine residues in peptides and proteins with fast kinetics and high chemoselectivity under neutral aqueous buffer conditions. We demonstrate that the incorporation of 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine residues enhances the thermostability of lasso peptide natural products and endows murine tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; with strong immunogenicity to break self&#8208;tolerance. Furthermore, the light&#8208;controlled time&#8208;resolution of this method allows the investigation of the impact of tyrosine nitration on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of &#945;&#8208;synuclein.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidimensional Characterization of Single&#8208;Molecule Dynamics in a Plasmonic Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanoscale manipulation and characterization of individual molecules is necessary for understanding the intricacies of molecular structure which ultimately governs phenomena such as reaction mechanisms, catalysis, local effective temperatures, surface interactions, and charge transport phenomenon. Here we demonstrate a platform that utilizes Raman enhancement between two nanostructured electrodes in combination with direct charge transport measurements to allow for simultaneous characterization of the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of a single molecule. This multi&#8208;dimensional information yields repeatable, self&#8208;consistent, verification of single&#8208;molecule resolution, and allows for detailed analysis of structural and configurational changes of the molecule in situ. These experimental results are supported by a machine&#8208;learning based statistical analysis of the spectral information and theoretical calculations to provide insight into the correlation between structural changes in a single&#8208;molecule and its charge transport properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ionic Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through Quaternization&#8208;Activated Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a simple approach to synthesize ionic vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through a quaternization&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel condensation at three aromatic methyl carbon atoms of  N  &#8208;ethyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridinium halide with multitopic aromatic aldehyde derivatives. The resultant COFs exhibited a honeycomb&#8208;like structure with high crystallinity and surface areas as large as 1343 m  2  g  &#8722;1  . The regular shape&#8208;persistent nanochannels and the positively charged polymeric frameworks allowed the COFs to be uniformly composited with linear polyethylene oxide and lithium salt, displaying ionic conductivity as high as 2.72 &#215; 10  &#8722;3  S cm  &#8722;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Highs and lows of bond lengths: Is there any limit?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We argue&#160;that two distinct points on the potential energy curve (PEC) of a pairwise interaction, the zero&#8208;energy crossing point and the point where the stretching force constant vanishes, allow to anticipate the range of possible distances one can expect between two atoms in diatomic, molecular moieties and crystalline systems. We show that these bond stability boundaries are unambiguously defined and correlate with topological descriptors of electron density&#8208;based scalar fields, and we put forward a practical method to calculate them easily using generic PECs. Chemical databases and quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations are used to analyze a full set of diatomic bonds of atoms from the  s&#8208;p  main block. Emphasis is placed on the effect of substituents in C&#8208;C covalent bonds, concluding that distances shorter than 1.14 &#197; or longer than 2.0 &#197; are unlikely to be achieved, in agreement with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;pressure data and transition state distances, respectively. Presumed exceptions, often due to changes in the reference state or ill&#8208;defined dissociation energies (e.g. O  2  2+  ), are used to place our model in the correct framework and to formulate a conjecture for chained&#8208;interactions, which offers a first explanation for the multimodal histogram of O&#8208;H distances reported for hundreds of chemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Evolution of Crystalline 3d&#8208;Transition Metal Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are among the most active and studied catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. However, previous works either focused on a small number of LDHs, applied synthetic routes with limited structural control, or used non&#8208;intrinsic activity metrics. This hampered the construction of consistent structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relations. Herein, by employing new individually developed synthesis strategies with atomic structural control, we obtained a broad series of crystalline &#945;&#8208;M  A  (II)M  B  (III) LDH and &#946;&#8208;M  A  (OH)  2  electrocatalysts (M  A  = Ni, Co, and M  B  = Co, Fe, Mn). We further derived their intrinsic activity through electrochemical active surface area normalization, which revealed the trend: NiFe LDH, CoFe LDH, Fe&#8208;free Co&#8208;containing catalysts, and Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Our theoretical reactivity modelling unraveled that the intrinsic activity trend originated from the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;site nature of the reaction centers, which lead to compound&#8208;dependent synergies, and diverse scaling relationships that may be used to design catalysts with improved performance.</dc:description>

         <title>An Amine&#8211;Borane System Featuring Room&#8208;Temperature Dehydrogenation and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8211;borane system has been discovered to deliver a reversible dehydrogenation/regeneration at room temperature. It provides a new way for hydrogen storage under mild conditions.







Abstract
Amine&#8211;borane complexes have been extensively studied as hydrogen storage materials. Herein, we report a new amine&#8211;borane system featuring a reversible dehydrogenation and regeneration at room temperature. In addition to high purity H2, the reaction between ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB) and ethylenediamine (ED) leads to unique boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen 5&#8208;membered rings in the dehydrogenation product where one boron is tricoordinated by three nitrogen atoms. Owing to the unique cyclic structure, the dehydrogenation product can be efficiently converted back to EDAB by NaBH4 and H2O at room temperature. This finding could lead to the discovery of new amine boranes with potential usage as hydrogen storage materials.

         <dc:description>We report an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective, complete hydrogenation of multiply substituted benzofurans in a one&#8208;pot cascade catalysis. The developed protocol facilitates the controlled installation of up to six new defined stereocenters and produces architecturally complex octahydrobenzofurans, prevalent in many bioactive molecules. A unique match of a chiral homogenous ruthenium&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an in situ activated rhodium catalyst from a complex precursor act in sequence to enable the presented process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Transformer: A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycle as an Adaptable Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Transformer: A flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated, all carbon&#8208;based &#8220;figure&#8208;eight&#8221; macrocycle (3) without a meso bridge was synthesized in one step. The supramolecular assembly behavior of 3 was investigated in this work; compared to the rigid conformation of dimer 1, the structure of tetramer 3 is more flexible due to its larger ring size, which endows it with the ability to adjust its conformation according to changes in the external environment.







Abstract
Here, we report a facile method to synthesize a series of macrocycles with different conformations. The planar macrocycle dimer (1), twisted macrocycle trimer (2) and &#8220;figure&#8208;eight&#8221; tetramer (3) are clearly elucidated by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis, in which the electron&#8208;rich phenanthrene units offer the possibility of supramolecular assembly. As expected, in the solid state, 1 and 3 assemble into a columnar stack and an interlocking dimer, respectively, via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the phenanthrene units. Compared to the rigid conformation of dimer 1, the structure of tetramer 3 is more flexible due to its enlarged ring size. 3 can deform from a figure&#8208;eight into a boat&#8208;shaped geometry to host a planar electron&#8208;deficient guest using its electron&#8208;rich phenanthrene units. When assembled with spherical electron&#8208;deficient C60, interestingly, 3 further undergoes a conformational transformation from a figure&#8208;eight to a belt shape in order to host C60. These supramolecular assembly behaviors of 3 demonstrate that it is an adaptable macrocyclic host for both planar molecules and fullerenes.

         <title>Potential&#8208;Induced Spin Changes in Fe/N/C Electrocatalysts Assessed by In Situ X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The needed improvements in the activity and stability of Fe/N/C&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the reduction of oxygen or carbon dioxide require a better understanding of their active sites&#8217; structure and electronic properties. To this end, herein we have applied ex situ and in situ X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy to track the potential&#8208;induced changes in the average spin state of these materials&#8217; molecular Fe&#8208;Nx sites.







Abstract
The commercial success of the electrochemical energy conversion technologies required for the decarbonization of the energy sector requires the replacement of the noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts currently used in (co&#8208;)electrolyzers and fuel cells with inexpensive, platinum&#8208;group metal&#8208;free analogs. Among these, Fe/N/C&#8208;type catalysts display promising performances for the reduction of O2 or CO2, but their insufficient activity and stability jeopardize their implementation in such devices. To circumvent these issues, a better understanding of the local geometric and electronic structure of their catalytic active sites under reaction conditions is needed. Herein we shed light on the electronic structure of the molecular sites in two Fe/N/C catalysts by probing their average spin state with X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Chiefly, our in situ XES measurements reveal for the first time the existence of reversible, potential&#8208;induced spin state changes in these materials.

         <title>Redefining the Mechanistic Scenario of Carbon&#8722;Sulfur Nucleophilic Coupling via High&#8208;Valent Cp*CoIV Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The joint application of experimental and computational approaches discloses unprecedented mechanistic intricacies associated to Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions when using nucleophilic coupling partners. The use of trifluoromethylthiolation reveals an exceptional reductive elimination event from high&#8208;valent Cp*CoIV that can be promoted by either chemical oxidants or electrochemical methods.







Abstract
The potential access to CoIV species for promoting transformations that are particularly challenging at CoIII still remains underexploited in the context of Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herein, we disclose a combined experimental and computational strategy for uncovering the participation of Cp*CoIV species in a Cp*Co&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond&#8208;reductive elimination. These studies support the intermediacy of high&#8208;valent Cp*Co species in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, under oxidative conditions, when involving nucleophilic coupling partners.

         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;switched hydroxylation and oxygenation of &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated carbanions with molecular oxygen under mild conditions are reported, delivering various useful &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated alcohols and ketones in high yields. The solvent&#8208;bonding effect tames the redox reactions of the hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfide intermediates, and alters their reactivity and switches the oxidation selectivities.







Abstract
The solvent&#8208;switched hydroxylation and oxygenation of &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated carbanions with molecular oxygen under mild conditions are reported. This strategy tames the redox reactions of the in situ generated hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfides, in which solvent&#8208;bonding can alter their reactivity and switch the oxidation selectivities. These controllable three&#8208;component reactions of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, thiols and molecular oxygen afford various useful &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated alcohols and ketones in high yields. Significantly, this protocol has been applied in the synthesis different bioactive molecules. Mechanism studies enable the detection of the hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfide intermediates and exclude the thiol&#8208;based radical pathway.

         <title>sp3 Bis&#8208;Organometallic Reagents via Catalytic 1,1&#8208;Difunctionalization of Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular, site&#8208;selective 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated olefins en route to versatile bis&#8208;organometallic B,B(Si)&#8208;reagents was developed by nickel catalyzed chain&#8208;walking events. This protocol is characterized by exceptional reaction rates, mild conditions, broad scope, excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, thus unlocking a new technique for preparing densely functionalized 1,2&#8208;bisorganometallic reagents from simple distinct, yet widely available, electrophilic partners.







Abstract
A catalytic 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated olefins en route to sp3 bis&#8208;organometallic B,B(Si)&#8208;reagents is described. The protocol is characterized by exceptional reaction rates, mild conditions, wide scope, and exquisite selectivity pattern, constituting a new platform to access sp3 bis&#8208;organometallics.

&lt;p&gt;A highly modular, site&#8208;selective 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated olefins en route to versatile bis&#8208;organometallic B,B(Si)&#8208;reagents was developed by nickel catalyzed chain&#8208;walking events. This protocol is characterized by exceptional reaction rates, mild conditions, broad scope, excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, thus unlocking a new technique for preparing densely functionalized 1,2&#8208;bisorganometallic reagents from simple distinct, yet widely available, electrophilic partners.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Rapid Positioning of Hierarchical Assemblies of Conjugated Polymers via Meniscus&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient, rapid and robust meniscus&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly (MASA) strategy, which combines a deliberately designed upper plate with a moving substrate, prints microscopically conjugated polymer (PFOs) patterns of different shapes within which the &#946;&#8208;phase PFOs self&#8208;assemble at the nanometer scale.







Abstract
Rapid and deliberate patterning of nanomaterials over a large area is desirable for device manufacturing. We report a method for meniscus&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly (MASA)&#8208;enabled rapid positioning of hierarchically assembled dots and stripes composed of luminescent conjugated polymer over two length scales. Periodically arranged conjugated poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene) (PFO) polymers, yield dots, punch&#8208;holes and stripes at microscopic scale via MASA. Concurrent self&#8208;assembly of PFOs into two&#8208;dimensional lenticular crystals within each dot, punch&#8208;hole and stripe is realized at nanoscopic scale. Hierarchical assembly is achieved by constraining the evaporation of the PFOs solution in two approximately parallel plates via a MASA process. The three&#8208;phase contact line (TCL) of the liquid meniscus of the PFOs was printed using the upper plate, yielding an array of curved stripes. Rapid creation of hierarchical assemblies via MASA opens up possibilities for large&#8208;scale organization of a wide range of soft matters and nanomaterials.

         <dc:description>The NHC&#8208;stabilised diboryne (B2(SIDep)2; SIDep = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) undergoes a high&#8208;yielding P&#8211;P bond activation with tetraethyldiphosphine at room temperature, to form a B2P2  heterocycle via a diphosphoryldiborene by 1,2&#8208;diphosphination. The heterocycle can be oxidised to a radical cation and a dication, respectively, depending on the oxidant used and its counterion. Starting from the planar, neutral 1,3&#8208;bis(alkylidene)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diborata&#8208;2,4&#8208;diphosphoniocyclobutane, each oxidation step leads to decreased B&#8211;B distances and loss of planarity by cationisation.

         <dc:description>The&#160;E. coli&#160;ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a paradigm for class Ia enzymes including human RNR, catalyzes the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks and requires a di&#8208;iron tyrosyl radical (Y122&#8226;) cofactor for activity. The knowledge on&#160;in vitro&#160;Y122&#8226; structure and its radical distribution within&#160;&#223;2 subunit has accumulated over the years; yet, little information exists on&#160;in vivo&#160;Y122&#8226;. Here, we characterize this essential radical in whole cells. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR and electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) demonstrate that the structure and electrostatic environment of Y122&#8226; are identical under&#160;in vivo&#160;and&#160;in vitro&#160;conditions. Pulsed dipolar EPR experiments shed light on a distinct&#160;in vivo&#160;Y122&#8226; per&#160;&#223;2 distribution supporting the key role of Y&#8226; concentrations in regulating RNR activity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suitably decorated small aromatic systems can organize one&#8208;dimensionally stacked structures. We found that nanographenes carrying long alkyl chains behaved similarly. The experiments demonstrated that the nanographenes underwent aggregation and disaggregation regulated by concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, and sonication.







Abstract
Suitably decorated small aromatic systems can organize stacked structures that display interesting properties arising from their unique morphologies. Although nanographenes produced by top&#8208;down methods have graphitic domains and can in principle be applied for such supramolecular systems, to our knowledge, no such example has been reported thus far. This is partly because of their limited solubility in organic solvents and partly because of their wide lateral size distribution. To realize nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular aggregates, nanographenes carrying alkyl chains with narrow lateral size distributions are employed. We find that the nanographenes undergo self&#8208;assembly and that self&#8208;assembly is regulated by concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, and sonication. Optical measurements and AFM images indicate that stacked structures are possible candidates for aggregates. A molecular mechanics calculation models the interactions in the aggregates. The nanographenes showed concentration&#8208;dependent morphologies on mica, stacked structures at low concentrations and polymer&#8208;like network structures on mica at higher concentrations.

         <title>Genetic encoding and enzymatic deprotection of a latent thiol side chain to enable new protein bioconjugation applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thiol group of the cysteine side chain is arguably the most versatile chemical handle in proteins. To expand the scope of established and commercially available thiol bioconjugation reagents, we genetically encoded a second such functional moiety in form of a latent thiol group that can be unmasked under mild physiological conditions. Phenylacetamidomethyl (Phacm) protected homocysteine (HcP) was incorporated and its latent thiol group unmasked on purified proteins using pencillin G acylase (PGA). The enzymatic deprotection depends on steric accessibility, but can occur efficiently within minutes on exposed positions in flexible sequences. The freshly liberated thiol group does not require treatment with reducing agents. We demonstrate the potential of this approach for protein modification with conceptually new schemes for regioselective dual labeling, thiol bioconjugation in presence of a preserved disulfide bond and formation of a novel intramolecular thioether crosslink.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;Active Chiral [3]Rotaxanes with Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9507-9515, April 19, 2021. </description>

The marriage of a switchable rotaxane and an AIEgen gave rise to the successful construction of a novel chiral [3]rotaxane&#8208;based CPL switching system with large glum values, remarkable difference in the glum values, and excellent cycling ability.







Abstract
The construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum) has attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications in diverse fields such as the development of smart devices and sensors. Herein, a new family of AIE&#8208;active chiral [3]rotaxanes were designed and synthesized, from which a novel CPL switching system was successfully constructed. The switching process was realized through the controlled motions of the chiral pillar[5]arene macrocycles along the axle through the addition or removal of the acetate anions, which not only modulated the chirality information transfer but also tuned the aggregations of the integrated [3]rotaxanes, thus resulting in reversible transformations between two emission states with both high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and high dissymmetry factors (glum) values.

         <title>An Acidity&#8208;Unlocked Magnetic Nanoplatform Enables Self&#8208;Boosting ROS Generation through Upregulation of Lactate for Imaging&#8208;Guided Highly Specific Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9562-9572, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acidity&#8208;unlocked and self&#8208;boosting ROS&#8208;generating nanoplatform is facilely developed via assembling FePt@FeOx and tamoxifen. Such smart nanoplatform can provide new insights for enhanced tumor&#8208;specific catalytic therapy with minimal side effects and exert the contrast ability of magnetic resonance and photoacoustic imaging.







Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy is an emerging tumor therapeutic strategy. However, the anticancer effects are greatly limited by the strong acidity requirements for effective Fenton&#8208;like reaction, and the inevitably &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity. Herein, we develop an acidity&#8208;unlocked nanoplatform (FePt@FeOx@TAM&#8208;PEG) that can accurately perform the high&#8208;efficient and tumor&#8208;specific catalysis for anticancer treatment, through dual pathway of cyclic amplification strategy. Notably, the pH&#8208;responsive peculiarity of tamoxifen (TAM) drug allows for the catalytic activity of FePt@FeOx to be &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; in acidic tumor microenvironments, while keeping silence in neutral condition. Importantly, the released TAM within cancer cells is able to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, leading to the upregulated lactate content and thereby the accumulated intracellular H+, which can overcome the intrinsically insufficient acidity of tumor. Through the positive feedback loop, large amount of active FePt@FeOx nanocatalyzers are released and able to access to the endogenous H2O2, exerting the improved Fenton&#8208;like reaction within the more acidic condition. Finally, such smart nanoplatform enables self&#8208;boosting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces strong intracellular oxidative stress, leading to the substantial anticancer outcomes in vivo, which may provide a new insight for tumor&#8208;specific cascade catalytic therapy and reducing the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity to surrounding normal tissues.

         <title>Dynamically Unveiling Metal&#8211;Nitrogen Coordination during Thermal Activation to Design High&#8208;Efficient Atomically Dispersed CoN4 Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9516-9526, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and atomic level electron microscopy were developed to monitor the structural evolution of the CoN4 site during the thermal activation to elucidate the formation mechanism. 700&#8201;&#176;C is a critical temperature to convert inactive Co oxides and metals to active CoN4 sites, and 900&#8201;&#176;C yields the Co&#8722;N bond with the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity.







Abstract
We elucidate the structural evolution of CoN4 sites during thermal activation by developing a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon host as an ideal model for Co2+ ion adsorption. Subsequent in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track the conversion from inactive Co&#8722;OH and Co&#8722;O species into active CoN4 sites. The critical transition occurs at 700&#8201;&#176;C and becomes optimal at 900&#8201;&#176;C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). DFT calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal&#8208;induced compressive strain of Co&#8722;N bonds in CoN4 active sites formed at 900&#8201;&#176;C. Further, we developed a two&#8208;step (i.e., Co ion doping and adsorption) Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with increased CoN4 site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated its outstanding fuel cell performance and durability.

         <title>A Robust PtNi Nanoframe/N&#8208;Doped Graphene Aerogel Electrocatalyst with Both High Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9590-9597, April 19, 2021. </description>

PtNiNF&#8208;NGA has PtNi nanoframes (PtNiNFs) with a high alloying degree, Pt&#8208;rich corners and thin edges, anchoring effect of the N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel to the PtNiNF, and hierarchical porosity. This endows it with fast mass transfer, enhanced intrinsic structure stability, modulated electronic state and optimized methanol oxidation reaction pathway, and thus both outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Insufficient catalytic activity and stability and high cost are the barriers for Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts in wide practical applications. Herein, a hierarchically porous PtNi nanoframe/N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel (PtNiNF&#8208;NGA) electrocatalyst with outstanding performance toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in acid electrolyte has been developed via facile tert&#8208;butanol&#8208;assisted structure reconfiguration. The ensemble of high&#8208;alloying&#8208;degree&#8208;modulated electronic structure and correspondingly the optimum MOR reaction pathway, the structure superiorities of hierarchical porosity, thin edges, Pt&#8208;rich corners, and the anchoring effect of the NGA, endow the PtNiNF&#8208;NGA with both prominent electrocatalytic activity and stability. The mass and specific activity (1647&#8197;mA&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1, 3.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of the PtNiNF&#8208;NGA are 5.8 and 7.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. It exhibits exceptional stability under a 5&#8208;hour chronoamperometry test and 2200&#8208;cycle cyclic voltammetry scanning.

Herein, a hierarchically porous PtNi nanoframe/N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel (PtNiNF&#8208;NGA) electrocatalyst with outstanding performance toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in acid electrolyte has been developed via facile tert&#8208;butanol&#8208;assisted structure reconfiguration. The ensemble of high&#8208;alloying&#8208;degree&#8208;modulated electronic structure and correspondingly the optimum MOR reaction pathway, the structure superiorities of hierarchical porosity, thin edges, Pt&#8208;rich corners, and the anchoring effect of the NGA, endow the PtNiNF&#8208;NGA with both prominent electrocatalytic activity and stability. The mass and specific activity (1647&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 3.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the PtNiNF&#8208;NGA are 5.8 and 7.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. It exhibits exceptional stability under a 5&#8208;hour chronoamperometry test and 2200&#8208;cycle cyclic voltammetry scanning.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture and Reduction to High&#8208;End Chemicals with Tetraalkylammonium Borohydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9580-9589, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct CO2 capture and reduction with tetraalkylammonium borohydride is reported. A phase transition from solid to liquid occurs during the absorption, making the product ready to use for HCOOH synthesis or N&#8208;formylation reactions.







Abstract
We demonstrate the ability of tetraalkylammonium borohydrides to capture large amounts of CO2, even at low CO2 concentrations, and reduce it to formate under ambient conditions. These materials show CO2 absorption capacities up to 30&#8197;mmol
&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar CO2. Every BH4&#8722; anion can react with three CO2 molecules to form triformatoborohydride ([HB(OCHO)3]&#8722;). The thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction were monitored by a magnetic suspension balance (MSB). Direct CO2 capture and reduction from air was achieved with tetraethyl, &#8208;propyl, and &#8208;butylammonium borohydride. The alkyl chain length played an important role in the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction, especially in CO2 diffusivity (crystallinity and free&#8208;volume), activation energy (charge&#8208;transfer dependent on the alkyl chain), and hydrophobicity. Adding HCl gave formic acid and the corresponding chloride ammonium salt, which can be recycled. In addition, transfer of formate was achieved for the N&#8208;formylation of an amine.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Prochiral Cyclobutanones via Nitrogen Insertion: A Concise Route to Chiral &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9719-9723, April 19, 2021. </description>

(1S,2R)&#8208;2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1&#8208;indanol was identified as a chiral nitrogen source in an oxidative rearrangement of prochiral cyclobutanones. Building on strain release as the driving force, this downstream stereoinduction enables a variety of &#947;&#8208;lactams to be synthesized including those bearing quaternary stereocenters. In addition, drug molecules pregabalin, baclofen, and brivaracetam are accessible, which underlines the broad applicability of this method.







Abstract
Asymmetric access to &#947;&#8208;lactams is achieved via a cyclobutanone ring expansion using widely available (1S,2R)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;indanol for chiral induction. Mechanistic analysis of the key N,O&#8208;ketal rearrangement reveals a Curtin&#8211;Hammett scenario, which enables a downstream stereoinduction (up to 88:12&#8197;dr) and is corroborated by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies. In combination with an easy deprotection protocol, this operationally simple sequence allows the synthesis of a range of optically pure &#947;&#8208;lactams, including those bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. In addition, the formal synthesis of drug molecules baclofen, brivaracetam, and pregabalin further demonstrates the synthetic utility and highlights the general applicability of the presented method.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Tertiary Alkylation of Terminal Alkynes with 1,3&#8208;Diesters via a Functionalized Alkyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9706-9711, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;mediated tertiary alkylation of terminal alkynes with 1,3&#8208;diesters offers a direct access to highly functionalized alkynes. The reaction is suitable for an array of substrates and proceeds in a highly selective manner even when employing alkanes containing other tertiary, benzylic, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds alpha to heteroatoms. The products can be transformed into a series of versatile building blocks.







Abstract
Direct oxidative C(sp)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling offers an ideal and environmentally benign protocol for C(sp)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations. As such, reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity with respect to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage have remained a persistent challenge. Herein is reported a simple method for iron&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;mediated tertiary alkylation of terminal alkynes with readily available and versatile 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The reaction is suitable for an array of substrates and proceeds in a highly selective manner even employing alkanes containing other tertiary, benzylic, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds alpha to heteroatoms. Elaboration of the products enables the synthesis of a series of versatile building blocks. Control experiments implicate the in situ generation of a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical species.

         <title>Engineering the Bandgap and Surface Structure of CsPbCl3 Nanocrystals to Achieve Efficient Ultraviolet Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9693-9698, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV&#8208;emitting halide perovskites are designed by doping Cd2+ into CsPbCl3 nanocrystals to broaden their band gap with the emission peak at 381&#8197;nm. Upon treatment with CdCl2, a UV photoluminescence quantum yield up to 60.5&#8201;% can be achieved. Transient absorption spectra and first&#8208;principle calculations confirm that the significantly improved optical performance benefits primarily from the marked elimination of surface traps such as a Cl vacancy.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design of novel ultraviolet luminescent CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (NCs) with the emission peak at 381&#8197;nm through doping of cadmium ions. Subsequently, a surface passivation strategy with CdCl2 is adopted to improve their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with the maximum value of 60.5&#8201;%, which is 67 times higher than that of the pristine counterparts. The PLQY of the surface passivated NCs remains over 50&#8201;% after one week while the pristine NCs show negligible emission. By virtue of density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the higher PLQY and better stability after surface passivation may result from the significant elimination of surface chloride vacancy (VCl) defects. These findings provide fundamental insights into the optical manipulation of metal ion&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 NCs.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate 1,6&#8208;, 1,8&#8208;, and 1,10&#8208;Borylation</title>

Asymmetric conjugate 1,6&#8208;, 1,8&#8208;, and 1,10&#8208;borylation catalyzed by a copper(I) complex is described. It delivered synthetically versatile &#945;&#8208;chiral boronates in moderate yields with excellent regio&#8208; and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric remote conjugate borylation is challenging as the control of regioselectivity is not trivial, the electrophilicity of remote sites is extenuated, and the remote asymmetric induction away from the carbonyl group is difficult. Herein, catalytic asymmetric conjugate 1,6&#8208;, 1,8&#8208; and 1,10&#8208;borylation was developed with excellent regioselectivity, which delivered &#945;&#8208;chiral boronates in moderate to high yields with high enantioselectivity. The produced chiral boronate smoothly underwent oxidation, cross&#8208;coupling, and one&#8208;carbon homologation to give synthetically versatile chiral compounds in moderate yields with excellent stereoretention. Furthermore, a stereomechanistic analysis was conducted using DFT calculations, which provides insights into the origins of the regioselectivity. Finally, the present 1,6&#8208;borylation was successfully applied in an efficient one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydrokavain.

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Activities for CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO Conversion on Fe2O3/MoO3: Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo Covalency Dominates the Intrinsic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9546-9552, April 19, 2021. </description>

A Z&#8208;Scheme Fe2O3/MoO3 hollow nanotube with a CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO selectivity of 95.7&#8201;% was developed. The thin&#8208;walled hollow structure facilitates a fast transfer of photogenerated carriers and enhances light utilization. The Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channel and internal electric field in the Fe2O3/MoO3 interface improve the charge transfer efficiency. PEC experiments and calculations demonstrate that C&#8722;H bond breaking is the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The catalytic conversion of alcohols under mild conditions is a great challenge because it is constrained by low selectivity and low activity. Herein, we demonstrate a hollow nanotube Fe2O3/MoO3 heterojunction (FeMo&#8208;2) for the photoelectrocatalytic conversion of small&#8208;molecule alcohols. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the optical carrier transfer rate is enhanced by constructing interfacial internal electric fields and Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channels. For the formox process, heterojunctions possess superior HCHO&#8208;selective reaction paths and free energy transitions, optimizing the selectivity of HCHO and enhancing the reactivity. FeMo&#8208;2 shows a greatly improved performance compared to single Fe2O3; the photocurrent density of FeMo&#8208;2 reaches 0.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 3.88&#8197;times that of Fe2O3 (0.17&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and the Faraday efficiency of the CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion is 95.7&#8201;%. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation and has potential for the production of HCHO and for conversion reactions of other small&#8208;molecule alcohols at cryogenic temperatures.

         <title>Crown Ether Functionalized Potassium&#8208;Responsive Anionocages for Cascaded Guest Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9573-9579, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;responsive anionocages were developed for cascaded guest delivery in a reversible manner. Binding of K+ by a crown ether functionalized, heteroleptic anionocage triggers the release and delivery of a TEA+ (tetraethylammonium) guest to another anionocage that is a weaker and less K+&#8208;sensitive receptor. This process could be fully reversed by elimination of the K+ with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand.







Abstract
In many critical biological processes, host&#8211;guest chemistry of protein receptors is regulated by effector molecules to realize cascaded delivery of messenger molecules between different targets. Mimicking these natural processes with artificial receptors remains a challenge. Herein, we report a cascaded guest delivery between two anionocages (anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven cages), in a reversible manner, wherein binding of K+ ions by a crown ether functionalized, heteroleptic A2L3 (A=anion, L=ligand) anionocage triggers the release and delivery of a TEA+ (tetraethylammonium) guest to another A2L3 anionocage that is a weaker and less K+&#8208;sensitive receptor. Elimination of the K+ with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand enables recapture of the TEA+ by the crown ether functionalized anionocage and thus realizes a reversed guest delivery. Moreover, integrative self&#8208;sorting of anionocages is firstly reported, leading to heteroleptic cages with enhanced guest binding affinities.

         <title>In&#8208;vitro and In&#8208;vivo Photocatalytic Cancer Therapy with Biocompatible Iridium(III) Photocatalysts</title>

Biocompatible IrIII photocatalysts with strong light absorption properties exhibit excellent phototherapeutic efficiency against cisplatin&#8208; and sorafenib&#8208;resistant cancer cells. Ir3 induces an intracellular redox imbalance through the unique photocatalytic oxidation of a co&#8208;enzyme, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), providing a novel mode of action for cancer phototherapy.







Abstract
Photocatalytic anticancer profile of a IrIII photocatalyst (Ir3) with strong light absorption, high turnover frequency, and excellent biocompatibility is reported. Ir3 showed selective photo&#8208;cytotoxicity against cisplatin&#8208; and sorafenib&#8208;resistant cell lines while remaining dormant to normal cell lines in the dark. Ir3 exhibited excellent photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular co&#8208;enzyme, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and amino acids via a single electron transfer mechanism. The photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance and change in mitochondrial membrane potential resulted in necrosis and apoptosis of cancer cells. Importantly, Ir3 exhibited high biocompatibility and photo&#8208;catalytic anticancer efficiency as evident from in vivo zebrafish and mouse cancer models. To the best of our knowledge, Ir3 is the first IrIII based photocatalyst with such a high biocompatibility and photocatalytic anticancer therapeutic effect.

The first stable coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate ([SCP]&#8722;) anion at a Lewis&#8208;acidic lanthanum(III) ion and its subsequent rearrangement to form a substituted heavy &#8220;fulminate&#8208;like&#8221; anion, induced by cyclic alkyl amino carbenes, are reported.







Abstract
We present the &#951;3&#8208;coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate anion in the complex (PN)2La(SCP) (2) [PN=N&#8208;(2&#8208;(diisopropylphosphanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylanilide)]. Structural comparison with dinuclear thiocyanate&#8208;bridged (PN)2La(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;SCN)2La(PN)2 (3) and azide&#8208;bridged (PN)2La(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;N3)2La(PN)2 (4) complexes indicates that the [SCP]&#8722; coordination mode is mainly governed by electronic, rather than steric factors. Quantum mechanical investigations reveal large contributions of the antibonding &#960;*&#8208;orbital of the [SCP]&#8722; ligand to the LUMO of complex 2, rendering it the ideal precursor for the first functionalization of the [SCP]&#8722; anion. Complex 2 was therefore reacted with CAACs which induced a selective rearrangement of the [SCP]&#8722; ligand to form the first CAAC stabilized group&#8197;15&#8211;group&#8197;16 fulminate&#8208;type complexes (PN)2La{SPC(RCAAC)} (5&#8201;a,b, R=Ad, Me). A detailed reaction mechanism for the SCP&#8208;to&#8208;SPC isomerization is proposed based on DFT calculations.

         <title>Harnessing Hypoxia&#8208;Dependent Cyanine Photocages for In&#8197;Vivo Precision Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9553-9561, April 19, 2021. </description>

We present a hypoxia&#8208;dependent cyanine photolysis mechanism for controlled release. P(Cy&#8208;N&#8208;CPT) could realize the precise orthogonal manipulation of photocaging and dual&#8208;modal optical signals for targeted therapy under hypoxic tumor conditions.







Abstract
Photocaging holds promise for the precise manipulation of biological events in space and time. However, current near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocages are oxygen&#8208;dependent for their photolysis and lack of timely feedback regulation, which has proven to be the major bottleneck for targeted therapy. Herein, we present a hypoxia&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;activation mechanism of dialkylamine&#8208;substituted cyanine (Cy&#8208;NH) accompanied by emissive fragments generation, which was validated with retrosynthesis and spectral analysis. For the first time, we have realized the orthogonal manipulation of this hypoxia&#8208;dependent photocaging and dual&#8208;modal optical signals in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, making a breakthrough in the direct spatiotemporal control and in&#8197;vivo feedback regulation. This unique photoactivation mechanism overcomes the limitation of hypoxia, which allows site&#8208;specific remote control for targeted therapy, and expands the photo&#8208;trigger toolbox for on&#8208;demand drug release, especially in a physiological context with dual&#8208;mode optical imaging under hypoxia.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron&#8208;Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9642-9649, April 19, 2021. </description>

Viologen&#8208;derived electron&#8208;transfer mediators (ETMs) are integrated into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) by a controllable post&#8208;synthetic method. The site&#8208;isolated ETM modules cooperate well with photosensitizer modules on the platform of COFs for enhanced electron&#8208;transfer ability, thereby remarkably promoting the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (34600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) from water splitting.







Abstract
Electron transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron&#8208;transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of a stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.

         <title>Ultrabright Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles Based on Small&#8208;Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9450-9458, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrabright nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared in a simple one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly approach by nanoprecipitation of fluorescent rhodamine dye with a macrocyclic anion receptor. Binding of the dye's counterion by the cyanostar macrocycle ensures separation of dye molecules to prohibit self&#8208;quenching while also acting as a UV antenna system to boost particle fluorescence. Glycol&#8208;stabilized NPs are used for live cell imaging.







Abstract
Ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) hold great promise for demanding bioimaging applications. Recently, extremely bright molecular crystals of cationic fluorophores were obtained by hierarchical coassembly with cyanostar anion&#8208;receptor complexes. These small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) ensure spatial and electronic isolation to prohibit aggregation quenching of dyes. We report a simple, one&#8208;step supramolecular approach to formulate SMILES materials into NPs. Rhodamine&#8208;based SMILES NPs stabilized by glycol amphiphiles show high fluorescence quantum yield (30&#8201;%) and brightness per volume (5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1/nm3) with 400 dye molecules packed into 16&#8208;nm particles, corresponding to a particle absorption coefficient of 4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. UV excitation of the cyanostar component leads to higher brightness (&gt;6000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1/ nm3) by energy transfer to rhodamine emitters. Coated NPs stain cells and are thus promising for bioimaging.

         <title>Nanospace Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through Dynamic Spacer Installation of Multifunctionalities for Efficient Separation of Ethane from Ethane/Ethylene Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9680-9685, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic spacer installation (DSI) strategy has been developed to realize a series of multifunctional metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs) with optimized pore space and pore environment for ethane/ethylene separation. The installation of functional spacers into the proto&#8208;LIFM&#8208;28 not only improves the pore volume, but also reduces the pore size, leading to enhanced C2H6/C2H4 separation performance.







Abstract
Herein, a dynamic spacer installation (DSI) strategy has been implemented to construct a series of multifunctional metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), LIFM&#8208;61/31/62/63, with optimized pore space and pore environment for ethane/ethylene separation. In this respect, a series of linear dicarboxylic acids were deliberately installed in the prototype MOF, LIFM&#8208;28, leading to a dramatically increased pore volume (from 0.41 to 0.82&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and reduced pore size (from 11.1&#215;11.1&#8197;&#197;2 to 5.6&#215;5.6&#8197;&#197;2). The increased pore volume endows the multifunctional MOFs with much higher ethane adsorption capacity, especially for LIFM&#8208;63 (4.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), representing nearly three times as much ethane as the prototypical counterpart (1.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Meanwhile, the reduced pore size imparts enhanced ethane/ethylene selectivity of the multifunctional MOFs. Theoretical calculations and dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the DSI is a promising approach for the rational design of multifunctional MOFs for this challenging task.

         <title>Efficient Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes: Selective Synthesis of Adipates and Other Aliphatic Diesters</title>

High value&#8208;added conversion: From gas to nylon precursor. This 100&#8201;% atom economic and industrially relevant process is strongly influenced by the system polarity.







Abstract
The dicarbonylation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to adipic acid derivatives offers the potential for a more cost&#8208;efficient and environmentally benign industrial process. However, the complex reaction network of regioisomeric carbonylation and isomerization pathways, make a selective and direct transformation particularly difficult. Here, we report surprising solvent effects on this palladium&#8208;catalysed process in the presence of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphin&#8208;oxylene (dtbpx) ligands, which allow adipate diester formation from 1,3&#8208;butadiene, carbon monoxide, and methanol with 97&#8201;% selectivity and 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economy under scalable conditions. Under optimal conditions a variety of di&#8208; and triesters from 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be obtained in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Structural and Spectroscopic Comparison of Soft&#8208;Se vs. Hard&#8208;O Donor Bonding in Trivalent Americium/Neodymium Molecules</title>

Two Am complexes, [Am{N(E=PPh2)2}3] (1&#8208;Am, E=Se; 2&#8208;Am, E=O) are compared to isoradial [Nd{N(E=PPh2)2}3] (1&#8208;Nd, 2&#8208;Nd) complexes. Covalent contributions are assessed and compared to U/La and Pu/Ce analogues. Through ab initio calculations grounded in UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we observe differences in f&#8208;orbital involvement between Am&#8211;Se and Nd&#8211;Se bonds, which are not present in O&#8208;donor congeners.







Abstract
Covalency is often considered to be an influential factor in driving An3+ vs. Ln3+ selectivity invoked by soft donor ligands. This is intensely debated, particularly the extent to which An3+/Ln3+ covalency differences prevail and manifest as the f&#8208;block is traversed, and the effects of periodic breaks beyond Pu. Herein, two Am complexes, [Am{N(E=PPh2)2}3] (1&#8208;Am, E=Se; 2&#8208;Am, E=O) are compared to isoradial [Nd{N(E=PPh2)2}3] (1&#8208;Nd, 2&#8208;Nd) complexes. Covalent contributions are assessed and compared to U/La and Pu/Ce analogues.

         <title>Allostery&#8208;Mimicking Self&#8208;assembly of Helical Poly(phenylacetylene) Block Copolymers and the Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9686-9692, April 19, 2021. </description>

The poly(phenylacetylene) block copolymers PPA&#8208;b&#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins. The copolymers can sequentially evolve from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation.







Abstract
Allostery can regulate protein self&#8208;assembly which further affects biological activities, and achieving precise control over the chiral suprastructures during self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. Herein, to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins, the poly(phenylacetylene) block copolymers PPA&#8208;b&#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to investigate their conformational&#8208;transition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. As the helical conformation of the block PsmNap spontaneously transforms from cis&#8208;transiod to cis&#8208;cisoid, the decreasing solubility of PsmNap blocks in THF induced self&#8208;assembly of PPA&#8208;b&#8208;PsmNap. The self&#8208;assembly structures of copolymers can sequentially evolve from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation. The screw sense of final helical strands was strictly correlated to the helicity of the block PsmNap. This is helpful to understand the mechanism of allostery&#8208;modulated self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Lewis Acid Strength of Interfacial Metal Sites Drives CH3OH Selectivity and Formation Rates on Cu&#8208;Based CO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9650-9659, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles, dispersed on supports decorated with isolated group IV and V metal centers on SiO2, catalyze the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH. The promotion of CH3OH formation rates and selectivity correlates with the Lewis acid strength of the group IV and V dopants, which stabilize surface intermediates at the periphery of Cu nanoparticles.







Abstract
CH3OH formation rates in CO2 hydrogenation on Cu&#8208;based catalysts sensitively depend on the nature of the support and the presence of promoters. In this context, Cu nanoparticles supported on tailored supports (highly dispersed M on SiO2; M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta) were prepared via surface organometallic chemistry, and their catalytic performance was systematically investigated for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. The presence of Lewis acid sites enhances CH3OH formation rate, likely originating from stabilization of formate and methoxy surface intermediates at the periphery of Cu nanoparticles, as evidenced by metrics of Lewis acid strength and detection of surface intermediates. The stabilization of surface intermediates depends on the strength of Lewis acid M sites, described by pyridine adsorption enthalpies and 13C chemical shifts of &#8208;OCH3 coordinated to M; these chemical shifts are demonstrated here to be a molecular descriptor for Lewis acid strength and reactivity in CO2 hydrogenation.

Amphiphilic TRL7/8 agonist adjuvanted recombinant Spike protein vaccine protects against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in mouse models.







Abstract
The search for vaccines that protect from severe morbidity and mortality because of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) is a race against the clock and the virus. Here we describe an amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ&#8208;PEG&#8208;CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile. It is water&#8208;soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration through binding to albumin, affording localized innate immune activation and reduction in systemic inflammation. The adjuvanticity of IMDQ&#8208;PEG&#8208;CHOL was validated in a licensed vaccine setting (quadrivalent influenza vaccine) and an experimental trimeric recombinant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein vaccine, showing robust IgG2a and IgG1 antibody titers in mice that could neutralize viral infection in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model.

         <title>Macroscalar Helices Co&#8208;Assembled from Chirality&#8208;Transferring Temperature&#8208;Responsive Carbohydrate&#8208;Based Bolaamphiphiles and 1,4&#8208;Benzenediboronic Acid</title>

Macroscalar, thermally stable helices were formed by co&#8208;assembly of temperature&#8208;responsive carbohydrate&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acids accompanying chirality transfer in alkaline solutions during the temperature decrease from 80&#8201;&#176;C to room temperature.







Abstract
We present the first example of macroscalar helices co&#8208;assembled from temperature&#8208;responsive carbohydrate&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles (CHO&#8208;Bolas) and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (BDBA). The CHO&#8208;Bolas contained hydrophilic glucose or mannose moieties and a hydrophobic coumarin dimer. They showed temperature&#8208;responsive reversible micelle&#8208;to&#8208;vesicle transition (MVT) in aqueous solutions. After the binding of carbohydrate moieties with boronic acids of BDBA in their alkaline solutions, right&#8208;handed helices were formed via the temperature&#8208;driven chirality transfer of d&#8208;glucose or d&#8208;mannose from the molecular to supramolecular level. These helices were co&#8208;assembled by unreacted BDBA, boronate esters (B&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds) between CHO&#8208;Bolas and BDBA, as well as boroxine anhydrides (B&#8722;O&#8722;B bonds) of self&#8208;condensed BDBA. After heating at 300&#8201;&#176;C under nitrogen, the helices displayed excellent morphological stability. Moreover, they emitted bright blue luminescence caused by strong self&#8208;condensation of BDBA and decomposition of coumarin dimers.

         <title>Universal Electrochemical Synthesis of Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductors: Mesoporous CdSe and CdTe Thin Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9660-9665, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel route for the synthesis of mesoporous semiconductor films. The pore size can be controlled through the molecular weight of the block copolymers, and the synthesized mesoporous CdSe film exhibits a high sensitivity of 204&#8197;mW&#8722;1&#8201;cm2 at 680&#8197;nm as a photodetector. This facile synthesis method shows a high potential for new optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Here we report the soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted electrochemical deposition of mesoporous semiconductors (CdSe and CdTe). The resulting mesoporous films are stoichiometrically equivalent and contain mesopores homogeneously distributed over the entire surface. To demonstrate the versatility of the method, two block copolymers with different molecular weights are used, yielding films with pores of either 9 or 18&#8197;nm diameter. As a proof of concept, the mesoporous CdSe film&#8208;based photodetectors show a high sensitivity of 204&#8197;mW&#8722;1&#8201;cm2 at 680&#8197;nm wavelength, which is at least two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the bulk counterpart. This work presents a new synthesis route for nanostructured semiconductors with optical band gaps active in the visible spectrum.

         <title>Rechargeable K&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a KSn Anode and a Carboxyl&#8208;Containing Carbon Nanotube Cathode Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9540-9545, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable K&#8208;CO2 batteries successfully fabricated with a KSn anode and a carboxyl&#8208;containing carbon nanotube cathode catalyst exhibit superior cycling stability and good rate performance because of the strong electrostatic interaction between the cathode catalyst and K2CO3, along with a dendrite&#8208;free anode with high stability. Moreover, the redox mechanism has been verified as 4&#8201;KSn + 3&#8201;CO2 &#8644; 2&#8201;K2CO3 + C + 4&#8201;Sn.

Metal K&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from large polarization and safety hazards, which mainly result from the difficult decomposition of K2CO3 and dendrite growth. Moreover, the battery redox mechanism remains not fully understood. Here we report K&#8208;CO2 batteries with KSn alloy as the anode and carboxyl&#8208;containing multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs&#8208;COOH) as the cathode catalyst, proving the redox mechanism to be 4&#8201;KSn + 3&#8201;CO2 &#8644; 2&#8201;K2CO3 + C + 4&#8201;Sn. Compared with K metal, the less active and dendrite&#8208;free KSn anode effectively enhances the safety and stability of CO2 batteries. More importantly, the strong electrostatic interaction between MWCNTs&#8208;COOH and K2CO3 weakens the C=O bond in K2CO3 and thus facilitates K2CO3 decomposition. As a result, the K&#8208;CO2 batteries show excellent cycling stability (an overpotential increase of 0.89&#8197;V after 400&#8197;cycles) and good rate performance (up to 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work paves a way to develop highly stable and safe CO2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Modulated Reactivity: An Acidic Silane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9618-9626, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a &#8801;SiH group can be greatly altered by enclosing it into a strained bicyclic scaffold. The resulting silane is acidic with an experimental pKaDMSO of 4.7&#8211;8.1, lower than phenol, benzoic acid, and most hydrosilanes. It also shows strain&#8208;release Lewis acidity in the form of coordination of a THF molecule with its subsequent activation towards weak nucleophiles. The resulting ring&#8208;opening product shows high geometric fluxionality.







Abstract
Compounds of main&#8208;group elements such as silicon are attractive candidates for green and inexpensive catalysts. For them to compete with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal complexes, new reactivity modes must be unlocked and controlled, which can be achieved through strain. Using a tris(2&#8208;skatyl)methylphosphonium ([TSMPH3]+) scaffold, we prepared the strained cationic silane [TSMPSiH]+. In stark contrast with the generally hydridic Si&#8722;H bond character, it is acidic with an experimental pKaDMSO within 4.7&#8211;8.1, lower than in phenol, benzoic acid, and the few hydrosilanes with reported pKa values. We show that ring strain significantly contributes to this unusual acidity along with inductive and electrostatic effects. The conjugate base, TSMPSi, activates a THF molecule in the presence of CH&#8208;acids to generate a highly fluxional alkoxysilane via trace amounts of [TSMPSiH]+ functioning as a strain&#8208;release Lewis acid. This reaction involves a formal oxidation&#8208;state change from SiII to SiIV, presenting intriguing similarities with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated processes.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Based Hybrid Supercapacitors via Macropores&#8208;Based Charge Storage in Organic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9610-9617, April 19, 2021. </description>

Aqueous Zn&#8208;based rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are attracting extensive attention, but many are based on low mass loading in the cathode and low Zn&#8208;utilization in the anode. A Zn&#8208;based hybrid supercapacitor using non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte is proposed, which shows promising performance with high mass loading in the cathode and high Zn utilization in the anode.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based aqueous supercapacitors are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported long&#8208;life and high&#8208;power performances are achieved with low Zn&#8208;utilization (&lt;0.6&#8201;%) and low mass loading in cathode (&lt;2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). And, many obtained high energy densities are generally evaluated without considering the mass of Zn&#8208;anode. Herein, we propose a Zn&#8208;based hybrid supercapacitor, involving a metal organic framework derived porous carbon cathode, a Zn&#8208;anode and an N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte containing Zn2+. We demonstrate that the charge storage of cathode mainly occurs in macropores, showing high rate performance at high mass loading (40&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, the aprotic nature of electrolyte and formation of Zn2+&#8208;DMF complex avoid the Zn&#8208;corrosion and dendrite formation. Therefore, the supercapacitor shows a long&#8208;life (9,000 cycles) with a high Zn&#8208;utilization (2.2&#8201;%). When calculated with the total mass of cathode (40&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and Zn&#8208;anode, the energy density reaches 25.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Locked Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers Showing Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9635-9641, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically&#8208;locked D&#8211;A conjugated polymers have been prepared by incorporating methyl groups between donor and acceptor. Due to the methyl&#8208;induced hindrance, the correlated torsion is greatly increased to boost hole&#8211;electron separation. As a result of the decreased &#916;EST, poly(TMTPA&#8211;DCB) is able to emit a strong TADF, revealing a record&#8208;high EQE of 24.0&#8201;% and 15.3&#8201;% for doped and non&#8208;doped devices, respectively.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers often possess a significant frontier molecular orbital overlap because of the conjugation elongation, leading to no thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) caused by a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#9653;EST). Herein a novel steric locking strategy is proposed by incorporating methyl groups into D&#8211;A conjugated polymers. Benefitting from the methyl hindrance, the torsion between the donor and acceptor can be well tuned to form a sterically&#8208;locked conformation, so that the unwanted relaxation toward planarity and thus conjugation elongation is prevented to boost hole&#8211;electron separation. The resultant D&#8211;A conjugated polymer achieves an extremely low &#916;EST of 0.09&#8197;eV to enable efficient TADF. The corresponding doped and non&#8208;doped devices are fabricated via a solution process, revealing a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.0&#8201;% (79.4&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 75.0&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 15.3&#8201;% (50.9&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 47.3&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1).

         <title>A TADF Emitter Featuring Linearly Arranged Spiro&#8208;Donor and Spiro&#8208;Acceptor Groups: Efficient Nondoped and Doped Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with CIEy &lt;0.1</title>

By combining a weak spiro&#8208;donor and a weak spiro&#8208;acceptor through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer, a linear D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type of TADF compound is constructed. Highly efficient nondoped (EQEmax: 22.5&#8201;%) and doped (EQEmax: 25.4&#8201;%) deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with a CIEy of less than 0.1 are realized based on the compound. The nondoped OLED represents the most efficient one achieved so far on the premise of a CIEy of less than 0.1.







Abstract
Reported herein is a molecular design strategy of deep&#8208;blue emitters for resolving the lack of highly efficient deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring CIEy (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) color coordinates matching the display requirements (&lt;0.1). The strategy is to combine weak spiro&#8208;donor and spiro&#8208;acceptor groups into a linear donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type of thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence molecule through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer. The strategy endows an emitter with deep&#8208;blue emission, a narrower emission bandwidth (51&#8197;nm in toluene), a high photoluminescence quantum yield (0.95 in toluene), weak concentration quenching, and efficient triplet&#8208;exciton utilization, which are all attractive characteristics for emitters of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with lower CIEy coordinates. Owing to the rational design, the emitter has realized not only highly efficient doped deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 25.4&#8201;% and CIEy less than 0.1 but also so far the most efficient nondoped deep&#8208;blue OLED (EQE up to 22.5&#8201;%) with CIEy less than 0.1.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Tumor Therapy via Integrated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9480-9488, April 19, 2021. </description>

A manganese single&#8208;atom enzyme (Mn/PSAE) was synthesized, which can efficiently catalyze the concurrent generation of .OH and .O2&#8722; in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, amorphous carbon&#8208;based Mn/PSAE has excellent NIR&#8208;photothermal performance, which makes it possible to combine the multi&#8208;catalytic and photothermal&#8208;enhanced tumor therapy.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom enzyme (SAE) is a novel type of nanozyme that exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity. Here, we constructed a PEGylated manganese&#8208;based SAE (Mn/PSAE) by coordination of single&#8208;atom manganese to nitrogen atoms in hollow zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Mn/PSAE catalyzes the conversion of cellular H2O2 to .OH through a Fenton&#8208;like reaction; it also promotes the decomposition of H2O2 to O2 and continuously catalyzes the conversion of O2 to cytotoxic .O2&#8722; via oxidase&#8208;like activity. The catalytic activity of Mn/PSAE is more pronounced in the weak acidic tumor environment; therefore, these cascade reactions enable the sufficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and effectively kill tumor cells. The prominent photothermal conversion property of the amorphous carbon can be utilized for photothermal therapy. Hence, Mn/PSAE exhibits significant therapeutic efficacy through tumor microenvironment stimulated generation of multiple ROS and photothermal activity.

         <title>TM LDH Meets Birnessite: A 2D&#8208;2D Hybrid Catalyst with Long&#8208;Term Stability for Water Oxidation at Industrial Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9699-9705, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;2D hybrid catalyst with advanced activity and long&#8208;term stability toward water oxidation under industrial alkali hydrogen production conditions is reported, which solves the instability problem of LDH and the low activity of Birnessite together. The modulated electronic structure of all transition metal ions with perfect linear correlation to electron transfer as well as the built&#8208;in electric field of the hybrid catalyst has been revealed.







Abstract
Efficient noble&#8208;metal free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water splitting. Inspired by Nature's oxygen evolution cluster in photosystem II and the highly efficient artificial OER catalyst of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), we designed an electrostatic 2D&#8208;2D assembly route and successfully synthesized a 2D LDH(+)&#8208;Birnessite(&#8722;) hybrid. The as&#8208;constructed LDH(+)&#8208;Birnessite(&#8722;) hybrid catalyst showed advanced catalytic activity and excellent stability towards OER under a close to industrial hydrogen production condition (85&#8201;&#176;C and 6&#8197;M KOH) for more than 20&#8197;h at the current densities larger than 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimentally, we found that besides the enlarged interlayer distance, the flexible interlayer NiFe LDH(+) also modulates the electronic structure of layered MnO2, and creates an electric field between NiFe LDH(+) and Birnessite(&#8722;), wherein OER occurs with a greatly decreased overpotential. DFT calculations confirmed the interlayer LDH modulations of the OER process, attributable to the distinct electronic distributions and environments. Upshifting the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in LDH promotes electron transfer from the layered MnO2 to LDH, significantly boosting up the OER performance. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient OER catalyst for industrial water oxidation.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Haliclonin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9666-9671, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of a tetracyclic natural product, haliclonin A, was achieved. The cyclohexane ring was derived from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, which was elaborated via Birch reduction, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and a reaction with an organocopper reagent. The lactam ring was constructed via reductive C&#8722;N bond formation. The two macrocyclic rings were formed via ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract
The total synthesis of haliclonin&#8197;A was accomplished. Starting from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, a functionalized cyclohexanone fused to a 17&#8208;membered ring was prepared through a Birch reduction/alkylation sequence, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition of an organocopper reagent to an enone moiety. Reductive C&#8722;N bond formation via an N,O&#8208;acetal forged the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. The allyl alcohol moiety was constructed by a sequence involving stereoselective &#945;&#8208;selenylation of an aldehyde via an enamine, syn&#8208;elimination of a selenoxide, and allylation of the aldehyde with an allylboronate. Formation of the 15&#8208;membered ring containing a skipped diene was achieved by ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and final transformations led to the synthesis of haliclonin&#8197;A.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Selective Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene in an Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9604-9609, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As enabled by the compact pore space and the complementary electrostatic potential fitting for CO2 molecules, ultramicroporous cadmium nitroprusside showed molecular quadrupole moment recognition towards CO2 over C2H2 (see picture) with a high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio of 6.0 and CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 85. Dynamic breakthrough experiments validated the potential of this compound for CO2/C2H2 separation.







Abstract
Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging owing to their similar physical properties and molecular dimensions. Herein, we report highly efficient electrostatically driven CO2/C2H2 separation in an ultramicroporous cadmium nitroprusside (Cd&#8208;NP) with compact pore space and complementary electrostatic potential well fitting for CO2, thus enabling molecular quadrupole moment recognition of CO2 over C2H2. This material shows a high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio of 6.0 as well as remarkable CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 85 under ambient conditions with modest CO2 heat of adsorption. Neutron powder diffraction experiments and molecular simulations revealed that the electrostatic potential compatibility between pore structure and CO2 allows it to be trapped in a head&#8208;on orientation towards the Cd center, whereas the diffusion of C2H2 is electrostatically forbidden. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of this compound for CO2/C2H2 separation.

The longest finite chain of metals is reported and the magnetic properties studied and modelled.







Abstract
A finite chain of thirty&#8208;one paramagnetic centers is reported, synthesized by reaction of hydrated chromium fluoride, copper carbonate and pivalic acid in the presence of 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrazacyclododecane (cyclen). Magnetic studies show predominantly anti&#8208;ferromagnetic exchange leading to a high density of low&#8208;lying spin states and large saturation field.

The vacant 
 orbital of boron contributes to the unexpected long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of boric acid, boron nitride, and fluoborite.







Abstract
For a long time, phosphors with long&#8208;lived emission are dominated by rare earth/transition metal ion&#8208;doped sulfides and oxides. Recently, organic materials capable of emitting long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are reported, carbon skeletons are almost the exclusive structural feature of the conjugated luminophores. Herein, we reported that boric acid, a non&#8208;metal and C&#8208;free material, could emit RTP with lifetime up to 0.3&#8197;s. Detailed investigations indicated the weak conjugation between the n electrons of the O atoms in the B&#8208;O confined space was the possible origin of RTP. Similar RTP was also found in electron&#8208;rich N/F systems, namely, BN and BF3 (BF4&#8722;). Importantly, the vacant 
 orbital of B was found to contribute to the relevant unoccupied molecular orbitals involved in excitation, which is different from previous reports on phosphorescence from arylboronic acids. The results confirm the unique role of B as a versatile structure motif for construction of new RTP materials.

         <title>Robust Cobalt Catalyst for Nitrile/Alkyne [2+2+2] Cycloaddition: Synthesis of Polyarylpyridines and Their Mechanochemical Cyclodehydrogenation to Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Polyaromatics**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9627-9634, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, inexpensive, and robust cobalt&#8208;based systems catalyze the [2+2+2] cycloaddition between unactivated nitriles and diarylacetylenes, including aryl and alkyl nitriles and cyanamides as well as di(hetero)arylacetylenes. The resulting tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines undergo mechanochemistry&#8208;enabled multifold cyclodehydrogenation to furnish nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with unprecedented skeletons.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and alkynes is an established synthetic approach to pyridines; however, these cycloadditions often rely on the use of tethered diynes or cyanoalkynes as one of the reactants. Thus, examples of efficient, fully intermolecular catalytic [2+2+2] pyridine synthesis, especially those employing unactivated nitriles and internal alkynes leading to pentasubstituted pyridines, remain scarce. Herein, we report on simple and inexpensive catalytic systems based on cobalt(II) iodide, 1,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, and Zn that promote [2+2+2] cycloaddition of various nitriles and diarylacetylenes for the synthesis of a broad range of polyarylated pyridines. DFT studies support a reaction pathway involving oxidative coupling of two alkynes, insertion of the nitrile into a cobaltacyclopentadiene, and C&#8208;N reductive elimination.

     alt="Robust Cobalt Catalyst for Nitrile/Alkyne [2+2+2] Cycloaddition: Synthesis of Polyarylpyridines and Their Mechanochemical Cyclodehydrogenation to Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Polyaromatics**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, inexpensive, and robust cobalt&#8208;based systems catalyze the [2+2+2] cycloaddition between unactivated nitriles and diarylacetylenes, including aryl and alkyl nitriles and cyanamides as well as di(hetero)arylacetylenes. The resulting tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines undergo mechanochemistry&#8208;enabled multifold cyclodehydrogenation to furnish nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with unprecedented skeletons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and alkynes is an established synthetic approach to pyridines; however, these cycloadditions often rely on the use of tethered diynes or cyanoalkynes as one of the reactants. Thus, examples of efficient, fully intermolecular catalytic [2+2+2] pyridine synthesis, especially those employing unactivated nitriles and internal alkynes leading to pentasubstituted pyridines, remain scarce. Herein, we report on simple and inexpensive catalytic systems based on cobalt(II) iodide, 1,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, and Zn that promote [2+2+2] cycloaddition of various nitriles and diarylacetylenes for the synthesis of a broad range of polyarylated pyridines. DFT studies support a reaction pathway involving oxidative coupling of two alkynes, insertion of the nitrile into a cobaltacyclopentadiene, and C&#8208;N reductive elimination. The resulting tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines serve as precursors to hitherto unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via mechanochemically assisted multifold reductive cyclodehydrogenation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Are Amines the Holy Grail for Facilitating CO2 Reduction?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9174-9179, April 19, 2021. </description>

Within the last decade, several of the most significant breakthroughs in the homogeneous electrochemical or photochemical reduction and hydrogenation of carbon dioxide have been driven by the introduction of amines or amine&#8208;derived moieties in the reaction mixture. These amines play multiple roles, which are discussed herein to provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The selective and efficient reduction of carbon dioxide represents a key solution to producing non&#8208;fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;based feedstocks for the chemical industry, while alleviating the increasing atmospheric concentration of this greenhouse gas. A variety of catalytic methods for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) have been developed, including hydrogenations and electrochemical or photochemical reductions. For many of the most significant breakthroughs reported in the last decade, we realized that amines or closely related functional groups play a critical role for such transformations, and in several cases, are directly associated with the catalyst as a pendant group. Amines play multiple roles, such as CO2 trapping agents, proton shuttles, electron donors, or facilitators of CO2 reductions through formamide derivatives. In this Viewpoint, we compile some of these recent findings, and discuss their significance in a broader context in an attempt to provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.

Differential covalency in trivalent actinide versus lanthanide bonding with soft donors can aid separations. In their Research Article on page&#8197;9459, Enrique&#8197;R. Batista, Andrew&#8197;J. Gaunt, Ping Yang, and co&#8208;workers compare electronic structure and bonding with isoradial Am3+ and Nd3+ using hard O&#8208; and soft Se&#8208;donor ligands. The first structural characterization of molecular Am&#8211;Se bonding, along with spectroscopy and ab&#8197;initio calculations, is used to evaluate f&#8208;orbital involvement for Am3+ versus Nd3+ and explain structural trends.

Stabilization of large (aza)acenes is a necessary challenge to unlock their full potential. &#8220;Clipping&#8221; an azaacene into a large ring complements stabilization by trialkylsilylalkynylation as demonstrated by Jan Freudenberg, Uwe&#8197;H.&#8197;F. Bunz and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;9270. &#8220;Jacketed&#8221; azapentacenes display superior photochemical and oxidative stability compared to their bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituted congeners.

The impressive and unexpected long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of boric acid (H3BO3) is unveiled by Peng Wu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;9500. Unlike traditional metallic inorganic or aromatic organic phosphors, the phosphorescence originates from the weak conjugation of lone pair electrons from O&#8197;atoms. The vacant pz orbital of B and the regular arrangement in the crystalline state with layer&#8208;like packing through abundant hydrogen bonding are found to contribute to the long&#8208;lived emission.

Amine&#8208;tagged defective Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 was prepared by solvothermal synthesis using aminosalicylic acid as a functionalized fragmented ligand, as described by Seung&#8197;Bin Baek, Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;9296. The covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification and subsequent post&#8208;synthetic metalation with palladium(II) ions affords a palladium(II)&#8208;incorporated Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 catalyst, which exhibits highly efficient, size&#8208;selective, and recyclable catalytic activity for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Metal Mediation: Diversity of Applications in Main&#8208;Group Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9247-9262, April 19, 2021. </description>

Alkali metals top the league when it comes to mediating reactions. Organolithium compounds have long been their captain, but now organosodium and organopotassium compounds are finding their form too. This Review highlights their victories in homogeneous catalysis, organic synthesis, low&#8208;valent aluminium chemistry, polymerization, and green chemistry.







Abstract
Organolithium compounds have been at the forefront of synthetic chemistry for over a century, as they mediate the synthesis of myriads of compounds that are utilised worldwide in academic and industrial settings. For that reason, lithium has always been the most important alkali metal in organometallic chemistry. Today, that importance is being seriously challenged by sodium and potassium, as the alkali&#8208;metal mediation of organic reactions in general has started branching off in several new directions. Recent examples covering main&#8208;group homogeneous catalysis, stoichiometric organic synthesis, low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group metal chemistry, polymerization, and green chemistry are showcased in this Review. Since alkali&#8208;metal compounds are often not the end products of these applications, their roles are rarely given top billing. Thus, this Review has been written to alert the community to this rising unifying phenomenon of &#8220;alkali&#8208;metal mediation&#8221;.

         <title>Role of Functionalized Pillararene Architectures in Supramolecular Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9205-9214, April 19, 2021. </description>

Pillararenes have become increasingly popular since their first discovery in 2008 because of their rigid, capacious, and hydrophobic cavities as well as their exposed functional groups. This Minireview highlights three types of catalysis with pillararenes: 1)&#8197;within the confined cavity or by attached pendent groups, 2)&#8197;by nanomaterials featuring pillararenes in their architecture, and 3)&#8197;by pillararene&#8208;derived polymeric materials.







Abstract
The many useful features possessed by pillararenes (PAs; e.g. rigid, capacious, and hydrophobic cavities, as well as exposed functional groups) have led to a tremendous increase in their popularity since their first discovery in 2008. In this Minireview, we emphasize the use of functionalized PAs and their assembled supramolecular materials in the field of catalysis. We aim to provide a fundamental understanding and mechanism of the role PAs play in catalytic process. The topics are subdivided into catalysis promoted by the PA rim/cavity, PA&#8208;based nanomaterials, and PA&#8208;based polymeric materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first overview on PA&#8208;based catalysis. This Minireview not only summarizes the fabrications and applications of PAs in catalysis but also anticipates future research efforts in applying supramolecular hosts in catalysis.

Not just H&#252;nig's base! Siegfried H&#252;nig's 100th birthday is a good time to recall the fundamental work of this versatile chemist. His group studied reactive intermediates, synthetic methods, and unique target compounds. The central leitmotif of his research was the synthesis and behavior of dyes, redox systems, and organic metals. H&#252;nig started his career during World War II and for 65&#8197;years he was a distinguished scientist and teacher.







Abstract
Examples from different research areas of Siegfried H&#252;nig are displayed to remind us that organic chemistry owes much more than H&#252;nig's base to this exceptionally versatile and creative chemist. The main research lines dealing with the synthesis and physical characterization of new dyes, multistage redox systems, and organic metals will be presented as well as his contributions to enamine chemistry, the discovery of diimine as a hydrogenation agent, and nucleophilic acylation with trimethylsilyl cyanide, which are less well&#8208;known nowadays. In addition, exotic compounds with parallel C=C and N=N bonds were systematically studied in H&#252;nig's group. Reflecting on the development of his research demonstrates both the importance of a systematic approach and how fruitful entirely unexpected results are if they meet a &#8220;well&#8208;prepared mind&#8221;. During H&#252;nig's academic career, teaching played an indisputable role. His efforts in modernizing the chemistry institute at W&#252;rzburg and his support of young researchers in the academic system in Germany are also highlighted.

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase 1 in Health and Disease: How&#8201;a&#8201;Frontline Antioxidant Becomes Neurotoxic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9215-9246, April 19, 2021. </description>

This review summarizes contemporary understanding of the biology of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) from SOD1 genetics through to protein function and stability. Our cumulative knowledge of these processes is advancing efforts to identify and target pathways of neurotoxicity driven by atypical SOD1 in multiple incurable neurodegenerative conditions.







Abstract
Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a frontline antioxidant enzyme catalysing superoxide breakdown and is important for most forms of eukaryotic life. The evolution of aerobic respiration by mitochondria increased cellular production of superoxide, resulting in an increased reliance upon SOD1. Consistent with the importance of SOD1 for cellular health, many human diseases of the central nervous system involve perturbations in SOD1 biology. But far from providing a simple demonstration of how disease arises from SOD1 loss&#8208;of&#8208;function, attempts to elucidate pathways by which atypical SOD1 biology leads to neurodegeneration have revealed unexpectedly complex molecular characteristics delineating healthy, functional SOD1 protein from that which likely contributes to central nervous system disease. This review summarises current understanding of SOD1 biology from SOD1 genetics through to protein function and stability.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Reactions of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9192-9204, April 19, 2021. </description>

Enantioselective reactions of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes are a particularly valuable approach for the production of enantioenriched chiral 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized ring&#8208;opened systems as well as carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. A number of chiral catalysts have been developed for asymmetric ring&#8208;openings, annulations, and rearrangements. This minireview highlights the developments and recent advances in this research area.







Abstract
Due to the synergistic &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; effect of vicinal electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes have been recognized as one of the most powerful building blocks to generate polyfunctional reactive intermediates after a strain&#8208;driven ring cleavage. Enantioselective reactions of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes provide an efficient approach to enantioenriched acyclic and cyclic compounds. A number of chiral Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids, transition metals, and organocatalysts have been designed for such transformations, including ring&#8208;openings, annulations, and rearrangements. This minireview highlights the developments and new advances in this field and describes new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.

Doubly alkylene bridged tetraazahexacene and (aza)pentacenes were synthesized, introducing an alternative and complementary method of stabilization of large (hetero)acenes to trialkylsilylalkynylation. The examined materials display superior photochemical and thermal stabilities compared to their TIPS&#8208;ethynyl substituted congeners.







Abstract
A doubly alkylene bridged 6,13&#8208;diphenylpentacene and analogously bridged azapentacenes were prepared; they are persistent. The doubly bridged azapentacenes display superior photochemical, oxidative and thermal stabilities compared to azapentacenes protected by bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituents&#8212;clipping an azaacene into a large ring is a viable complement in stabilization.

A benzaldehyde lyase catalyzed intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction, that has not been observed in other ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes known in nature, was reported in this work. A series of chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives, important building blocks in pharmaceuticals products, were obtained in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.).







Abstract
The reliable design and prediction of enzyme promiscuity to access transformations not observed in nature remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we present the first example of an intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction catalyzed by benzaldehyde lyase, guided by the rational structure screening of various ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After optimization, high productivity (up to 99&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.) for this novel enzyme function was achieved.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Tagged Fragmented Ligand Installation for Covalent Modification of MOF&#8208;74</title>

Aminosalicylic acid has been used as a functionalized fragment to generate an amine&#8208;tagged defect&#8208;engineered Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, which could be covalently modified post&#8208;synthetically to generate metal&#8208;binding sites. Subsequent metalation with PdII ions afforded PdII&#8208;incorporated Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, which is a highly efficient, size&#8208;selective, and recyclable catalyst for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
MOF&#8208;74 is one of the most explored metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), but its functionalization is limited to the dative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of the monodentate solvent site. Owing to the nature of the organic ligand and framework structure of MOF&#8208;74, the covalent PSM of MOF&#8208;74 is very demanding. Herein, we report, for the first time, the covalent PSM of amine&#8208;tagged defective Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, which is prepared by de&#8197;novo solvothermal synthesis by using aminosalicylic acid as a functionalized fragmented organic ligand. The covalent PSM of the amino group generates metal binding sites, and subsequent post&#8208;synthetic metalation with PdII ions affords the PdII&#8208;incorporated Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 catalyst. This catalyst exhibits highly efficient, size&#8208;selective, and recyclable catalytic activity for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. This strategy is also useful for the covalent modification of amine&#8208;tagged defective Ni2(DOBPDC), an expanded analogue of MOF&#8208;74.

         <title>Efficient Photoelectrochemical Conversion of Methane into Ethylene Glycol by WO3 Nanobar Arrays</title>

Photoelectrochemical conversion of methane into ethylene glycol with a 66&#8201;% selectivity and 0.47&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 production rate at a potential of 1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE under illumination is achieved by WO3 nanobars with high {010} facet ratio.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of methane (CH4) has been extensively explored for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, yet remains a great challenge in high selectivity toward C2+ products. Herein, we report the optimization of the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) on WO3 via facet tuning to achieve efficient ethylene glycol production from PEC CH4 conversion. A combination of materials simulation and radicals trapping test provides insight into the reactivity of .OH on different facets of WO3, showing the highest reactivity of surface&#8208;bound .OH on {010} facets. As such, the WO3 with the highest {010} facet ratio exhibits a superior PEC CH4 conversion efficiency, reaching an ethylene glycol production rate of 0.47&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Based on in situ characterization, the methanol, which could be attacked by reactive .OH to form hydroxymethyl radicals, is confirmed to be the main intermediate for the production of ethylene glycol. Our finding is expected to provide new insight for the design of active and selective catalysts toward PEC CH4 conversion.

Chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interactions between a chalcogen atom and the &#960;&#8208;electron cloud can drive a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction efficiently. A simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.







Abstract
While the presence of sulfur&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction is a general phenomenon in the biological systems, the exploitation of this noncovalent force in a chemical process yet remains elusive. Herein, we describe the concept of chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis that activates molecules of &#960; systems through the interaction between chalcogen and &#960;&#8208;electron cloud. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies using a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction demonstrate that S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction can drive the cycloaddition reaction efficiently. Experimental results suggest that a simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured NiO Films with Spin Polarisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9421-9426, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral mesostructured NiO films are reported which exhibit chirality&#8208;dependent spin polarisations of the moving electrons under either applied voltage or photoexcitation. An asymmetric effective magnetic field is induced with electron motion in the symmetry&#8208;broken NiO. Thus, the antipodal chiral mesostructured NiO films exhibit asymmetric responses to the electron spin and result in opposite spin polarisations.







Abstract
Spin polarisation is found in the centrosymmetric nonferromagnetic crystals, chiral mesostructured NiO films (CMNFs), fabricated through the symmetry&#8208;breaking effect of a chiral molecule. Two levels of chirality were identified: primary nanoflakes with atomically twisted crystal lattices and secondary helical stacking of the nanoflakes. Spin polarisation of the CMNFs was confirmed by chirality&#8208;dependent magnetic&#8208;tip conducting atomic force microscopy (mc&#8208;AFM) and magnetic field&#8208;independent magnetic circular dichroism (MCD). Electron transfer in the symmetry&#8208;breaking electric field was speculated to create chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields. The asymmetric spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) generated by effective magnetic fields selectively modifies the opposite spin motion in the antipodal CMNFs. Our findings provide fundamental insights for directional spin control in unprecedented functional inorganic materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines with Aryl Halides via Paired Electrolysis</title>

A novel strategy for the N&#8208;arylation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines has been developed by merging nickel catalysis and electrochemistry (in an undivided cell), thereby providing a practical method for the synthesis of sulfoximine derivatives. Paired electrolysis is employed in this protocol, so a sacrificial anode is not required.







Abstract
A novel strategy for the N&#8208;arylation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines has been developed by merging nickel catalysis and electrochemistry (in an undivided cell), thereby providing a practical method for the construction of sulfoximine derivatives. Paired electrolysis is employed in this protocol, so a sacrificial anode is not required. Owing to the mild reaction conditions, excellent functional group tolerance and yield are achieved. A preliminary mechanistic study indicates that the anodic oxidation of a NiII species is crucial to promote the reductive elimination of a C&#8722;N bond from the resulting NiIII species at room temperature.

         <title>Monomer Controlled Switchable Copolymerization: A Feasible Route for the Functionalization of Poly(lactide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9274-9278, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new monomer controlled self&#8208;switchable copolymerization was developed with Salen&#8208;MnIII&#8208;Cl complexes. Chemoselective copolymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) and lactide (LA) was explored without cocatalyst or chain transfer agent (CTA).







Abstract
Switchable polymerization is an attractive strategy to enable the sequential selectivity of multi&#8208;block polyesters. Besides, these well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block polyesters could enable further modification for wider applications. Herein, based on the reversible insertion of CO2 by Salen&#8208;MnIII, a new monomer controlled self&#8208;switchable polymerization route was developed. Chemoselective ring opening copolymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) and lactide (LA) was explored without cocatalyst. The sequential conversion of OCAs and LA into the polymer chain could form multi&#8208;block polyesters. Based on this strategy, a series of multi&#8208;block polyesters with different pendant groups were synthesized. Furthermore, by modifying the propargyl&#8208;containing copolymers with quaternary ammonium groups, we have realized antibacterial functionalization of PLA. These results imply the potential application of this strategy for the fabrication of functional polymers for biomedical applications.

         <title>Dithiophene&#8208;Fused Oxadiborepins and Azadiborepins: A New Class of Highly Fluorescent Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9290-9295, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithienooxa&#8208; and &#8208;azadiborepins are accessible in a modular way from a common precursor. These BNB&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly efficient blue&#8208;light emitters with quantum yields up to 96&#8201;%. In&#8208;depth theoretical studies reveal that the previously unknown azadiborepin ring system is weakly aromatic.







Abstract
Access to dithiophene&#8208;fused oxadiborepins and the first azadiborepins attained via a modular synthesis route are presented. The new compounds emit intense blue light, some of which demonstrate fluorescence quantum yields close to unity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed electrochemically reversible one&#8208;electron reduction processes. The weak aromatic character of the novel 1,2,7&#8208;azadiborepin ring is demonstrated with in&#8208;depth theoretical investigations using nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) scans and anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) calculations.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Spring&#8208;Like Motion of an Anion&#8208;Based Triple Helicate by Tetraalkylammonium Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9389-9394, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven triple helicate molecular spring undergoes reversible extension&#8208;contraction motion by addition/removal of tetraalkylammonium guest cations, which is accompanied by an &#8220;orientational&#8221; isomerization (i.e. rotation of an anion) of the helicate to facilitate guest binding. The spring&#8208;like motion is modulated by both the size and shape of the cationic guest.







Abstract
Supramolecular springs are a class of molecular devices that may provide implications to the macroscopic spring behavior from the molecular level. Helical structures are suitable molecular springs because the specific twisting of the helical strands can cause spring&#8208;like (extension&#8208;contraction) movement along the axis upon external stimuli. Herein we report an anion&#8208;based triple&#8208;helicate spring, which can undergo reversible contraction&#8211;extension motion through introduction and removal of tetraalkylammonium cations, including TMA+ and analogous irregular tetrahedral cations bearing different alkyl chains, while the relative orientation of the two phosphate ions changes to facilitate guest inclusion. Notably, the degree of contraction (shortening of the helical pitch) can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the shape and size of guest cation. However, with the larger cations (TEA+, TPA+ and TBA+), the meso&#8208;helicate configuration is obtained, which interconverts with the helicate by addition/removal of TMA+ ion.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane Permselectivity Modification by Manganese(II) Acetylacetonate Vapor Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9316-9320, April 19, 2021. </description>

ZIF&#8208;8 membrane separation performance is modified by a facile vapor&#8208;phase metal&#8211;organic treatment. Significant increase in selectivity for propylene/propane and hydrogen over other gases is demonstrated at the expense of reduced flux.







Abstract
Vapor&#8208;phase treatment of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with manganese(II) acetylacetonate (Mn(acac)2) allows permselectivity tuning. Propylene/propane selectivity increases from 31 to 210 after the Mn(acac)2 treatment at 165&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min, while selectivities increase from 14.6 to 242 for H2/CH4, from 2.9 to 38 for CO2/CH4, from 2.4 to 29 for CO2/N2, and from 2.9 to 7.5 for O2/N2, after Mn(acac)2 treatment at 175&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min. Stable equimolar propylene/propane mixture selectivity of 165 at ambient temperature and 4&#8197;bar equimolar feed with a propylene flux of 8.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1 is established. A control experiment excludes thermal treatment alone causing these changes. XPS analysis reveals the presence of Mn(acac)2 on the outer surface of the vapor&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8 membranes while no other changes are detectable by X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy.

Propylene/propane selectivity increases from 31 to 210 after the Mn(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment at 165&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min, while selectivities increase from 14.6 to 242 for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, from 2.9 to 38 for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, from 2.4 to 29 for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and from 2.9 to 7.5 for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, after Mn(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment at 175&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min. Stable equimolar propylene/propane mixture selectivity of 165 at ambient temperature and 4&#8197;bar equimolar feed with a propylene flux of 8.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is established. A control experiment excludes thermal treatment alone causing these changes. XPS analysis reveals the presence of Mn(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the outer surface of the vapor&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8 membranes while no other changes are detectable by X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pyrimidin&#8208;6&#8208;yl Trifluoroborate Salts as Versatile Templates for Heterocycle Synthesis</title>

Stable and enabling: Pyrimidine trifluoroborates are an under&#8208;developed scaffold that have been rarely reported in the literature. These compounds participate in a rich array of downstream functionalization reactions that are underpinned by the unique features of the trifluoroborate group; its robustness provides an opportunity to carry out chemoselective reactions at other positions on the pyrimidine while providing a pathway for elaboration at the C&#8722;B bond when activated.







Abstract
We report a novel and general method to access a highly under&#8208;studied privileged scaffold&#8212;pyrimidines bearing a trifluoroborate at C4, and highlight the broad utility of these intermediates in a rich array of downstream functionalization reactions. This chemistry is underpinned by the unique features of the trifluoroborate group; its robustness provides an opportunity to carry out chemoselective reactions at other positions on the pyrimidine while providing a pathway for elaboration at the C&#8722;B bond when suitably activated.

         <title>Growth of Homogeneous High&#8208;Density Horizontal SWNT Arrays on Sapphire through a Magnesium&#8208;Assisted Catalyst Anchoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9330-9333, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnesium&#8208;modification strategy was developed for anchoring catalyst nanoparticles on sapphire, leading to a higher performance by offering a stronger metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). We realized homogeneous horizontal single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) arrays with a highest density of 110 tubes &#956;m&#8722;1 on an entire 10&#215;10 mm2 magnesium&#8208;modified sapphire.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ growth of high&#8208;density single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) arrays with homogeneity is highly desirable for integrated circuits. However, disastrous migration and aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles on substrate has greatly limited the area of as&#8208;grown SWNT arrays. Herein, we develop a magnesium&#8208;assisted catalyst anchoring strategy to restrain catalyst nanoparticles sintering on substrate. Magnesium modification ameliorates sapphire surface by high temperature solid reaction and thus provides a stronger metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). Hereby, we realize the direct growth of high&#8208;density SWNT arrays that fully cover an entire 10&#215;10&#8197;mm2 substrate with the local highest density of &#8776;110 tubes &#956;m&#8722;1 using iron as catalyst. This strategy was also proven universal when employing solid carbide catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Lewis Acid Sites in Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Monoliths to Enhance Propane Dehydrogenation at Reduced Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9311-9315, April 19, 2021. </description>

Porous single&#8208;crystalline molybdenum nitride monoliths can be grown with a high density of Lewis acid sites at the well&#8208;defined surface. This porous material shows enhanced non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at reduced temperatures.







Abstract
The non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene plays an important role in the light&#8208;olefin chemical industry. However, the conversion and selectivity remain a fundamental challenge at low temperatures. Here we create and engineer high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at well&#8208;defined surfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo2N and MoN monoliths to enhance the non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The top&#8208;layer Mo ions with unsaturated Mo&#8208;N1/6 and Mo&#8208;N1/3 coordination structures provide high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at the surface, leading to the effective activation of C&#8722;H bonds without the overcracking of C&#8722;C bonds during the non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. We demonstrate a propane conversion of &#8776;11&#8201;% and a propylene selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% with porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo2N and MoN monoliths at 500&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Heterocyclic Ring&#8208;Opening of Nanographene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9427-9432, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic segregation reaction with tetraazaanthraquinodimethane was performed on Au(111) by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscope at 4.3&#8197;K. A combination of high&#8208;resolution imaging and density functional theory calculations prove that the intramolecular ring&#8208;forming and &#8208;opening are strongly affected by the initial hydrogen&#8211;substrate interaction, while the product is identical.







Abstract
Cyclo&#8208;dehydrogenation is of importance to induce the planarization of molecules on noble surfaces upon annealing. In contrast to a number of successful syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by forming carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, it is still rare to conduct conjugation and cleavage of carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in molecules. Here, we present a systematic transformation of the C&#8722;N bonds in11,11,12,12&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaanthraquinodimethane as well as three other derivatives on Au(111). With bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we discovered novel the &#8220;heterocyclic segregation&#8221; reaction of one pyrazine ring with two nitrogen atoms to form two quinoline rings with one nitrogen each. Density functional theory calculations showed that the intramolecular ring&#8208;forming and &#8208;opening of N&#8208;heterocycles are strongly affected by the initial hydrogen&#8211;substrate interaction.

A curved expanded rosarin and fullerene complex showed magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;recombination dynamics and triplet&#8208;state population in both low (&lt;100&#8197;mT) and high field regime (&gt;500&#8197;mT) mediated by the hyperfine coupling and &#916;g mechanisms, respectively. This result leads us to suggest that magnetic fields could be applied to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaics or optoelectronics.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;recombination processes are critical for photovoltaic applications and should be suppressed for efficient charge transport. Here, we report that an applied magnetic field (0&#8211;1&#8197;T) can be used control the charge&#8208;recombination dynamics in an expanded rosarin&#8208;C60 complex. In the low magnetic field regime (&lt;100&#8197;mT), the charge&#8208;recombination rate slows down due to hyperfine coupling, as inferred from transient absorption spectroscopic analyses. In contrast, in the high field regime, i.e., over 500&#8197;mT, the charge&#8208;recombination rate recovers and increases because the &#916;g mechanism facilitates spin conversion to a triplet charge&#8208;separated state (S to T0) that undergoes rapid charge&#8208;recombination to a localized rosarin triplet state. Therefore, we highlight the charge&#8208;recombination rate and the localized triplet state population can be modulated by the magnetic field in charge donor/acceptor non&#8208;covalent complexes.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Plasmodium falciparum Proteasome Inhibitor with Anti&#8208;malaria Activity in Humanized Mice</title>

Pf20S inhibitors possess the potential to be therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission&#8208;blocking antimalarials. We present a novel and highly species&#8208;selective malaria proteasome inhibitor that potently reduced parasitemia in humanized mice infected with P. falciparum, the deadliest plasmodium parasite.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum proteasome (Pf20S) inhibitors are active against Plasmodium at multiple stages&#8212;erythrocytic, gametocyte, liver, and gamete activation stages&#8212;indicating that selective Pf20S inhibitors possess the potential to be therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission&#8208;blocking antimalarials. Starting from a reported compound, we developed a noncovalent, macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of the malarial proteasome with high species selectivity and improved pharmacokinetic properties. The compound demonstrates specific, time&#8208;dependent inhibition of the &#946;5 subunit of the Pf20S, kills artemisinin&#8208;sensitive and artemisinin&#8208;resistant P.&#8197;falciparum isolates in&#8197;vitro and reduces parasitemia in humanized, P.&#8197;falciparum&#8208;infected mice.

         <title>A Cisplatin&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Mitochondrial Platinum Accumulation in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9264-9269, April 19, 2021. </description>

Real&#8208;time cisplatin trafficking: A mitochondria&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe was engineered to detect the clinically&#8208;important platinum drug cisplatin in real&#8208;time. The probe was applied to investigate the mitochondria as cellular targets for cisplatin and its analogues. Two distinct pathways whereby Pt complexes could be delivered to mitochondria after cell entry were uncovered.







Abstract
Mitochondria have emerged as important targets for cisplatin in cancer therapy. Apart from cisplatin, anticancer Pt complexes based on similar scaffolds have also been developed to target mitochondria. Yet cellular processing of cisplatin or these mitochondria&#8208;targeting Pt analogues remained unexplored, largely due to a lack of tools capable of probing these Pt drugs within an intracellular environment. We developed the first mitochondria&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of Pt accumulation in mitochondria. We applied the probe to investigate mitochondria as cellular targets for Pt drug complexes and uncovered two distinct pathways whereby these Pt complexes could be delivered to mitochondria after cell entry.

Polydopamine&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized oxygen microcapsules are developed. These are capable of alleviating the hypoxia condition of a tumor microenvironment. Synergetic treatment using oxygen microcapsules and gemcitabine drugs is shown to be an effective strategy for enhanced tumor therapy.







Abstract
Most tumors have more severe hypoxia levels than normal tissue; tumor hypoxia is thus a useful target for cancer treatment. Here, we develop an effective oxygen delivery vehicle of polydopamine&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized oxygen microcapsules by interfacial polymerization. The oxygen microcapsules have excellent biocompatibility. Oxygen could easily diffuse out from the microcapsules, thus increasing and maintaining the microenvironment at an oxygen&#8208;rich state. In vitro cell cultures confirm that oxygen microcapsules could effectively improve the hypoxia microenvironment, showing the lowest fluorescent intensity of hypoxia&#8208;green&#8208;labeled cells. When injected subcutaneously in vivo, oxygen microcapsules could also improve the tumor's hypoxia microenvironment, thus suppressing the growth of tumor. Synergetic therapy using oxygen microcapsules and gemcitabine drugs is an effective way for tumor treatment, showing the best performance in suppressing the tumor's growth.

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of the Physical Virus Titer and Purity by Ultrasensitive Flow Virometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9351-9356, April 19, 2021. </description>

A laboratory&#8208;built nano&#8208;flow cytometer was employed to simultaneously detect the side&#8208;scatter and fluorescence signals of individual viral particles. The physical virus titer, purity, and heterogeneity of virus preparations can be precisely quantified.







Abstract
Rapid quantification of viruses is vital for basic research on viral diseases as well as biomedical application of virus&#8208;based products. Here, we report the development of a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;particle method to enumerate intact viral particles by ultrasensitive flow virometry, which detects single viruses as small as 27&#8197;nm in diameter. The nucleic acid dye SYTO 82 was used to stain the viral (or vector) genome, and a laboratory&#8208;built nano&#8208;flow cytometer (nFCM) was employed to simultaneously detect the side&#8208;scatter and fluorescence signals of individual viral particles. Using the bacteriophage T7 as a model system, intact virions were completely discriminated from empty capsids and naked viral genomes. Successful measurement of the physical virus titer and purity was demonstrated for recombinant adenoviruses, which could be used for gene delivery, therapeutic products derived from phage cocktails, and infected cell supernatants for veterinary vaccine production.

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Stabilized Di&#8208; and Tetranuclear Molybdenum Sulfide Clusters Form Stable Catalytic Hydrogenation Sites</title>

Dinuclear (Mo2S4) and tetranuclear (Mo4S4) molybdenum sulfide clusters were synthesized within the supercages of a faujasite zeolite. Encaged Mo4S4 clusters possess a structure similar to the nitrogenase enzyme's FeMo&#8208;cofactor; both contain unpaired electrons and show identical catalytic activity per cluster. Their activity for ethene hydrogenation is stable, while layered MoS2 deactivates significantly under the same conditions.







Abstract
Supercages of faujasite (FAU)&#8208;type zeolites serve as a robust scaffold for stabilizing dinuclear (Mo2S4) and tetranuclear (Mo4S4) molybdenum sulfide clusters. The FAU&#8208;encaged Mo4S4 clusters have a distorted cubane structure similar to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor in nitrogenase. Both clusters possess unpaired electrons on Mo atoms. Additionally, they show identical catalytic activity per sulfide cluster. Their catalytic activity is stable (&gt;150&#8197;h) for ethene hydrogenation, while layered MoS2 structures deactivate significantly under the same reaction conditions.

         <title>Formation and Characterization of BeFe(CO)4&#8722; Anion with Beryllium&#8722;Iron Bonding</title>

The heteronuclear BeFe(CO)4&#8722; anion complex is generated in the gas phase, which is characterized to have a quite short Be&#8722;Fe bonded C3v structure. The findings imply that metal&#8211;metal bonding between s&#8208;block and transition metals is viable under suitable coordination environment.







Abstract
Heteronuclear BeFe(CO)4&#8722; anion complex is generated in the gas phase, which is detected by mass&#8208;selected infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in the carbonyl stretching frequency region. The complex is characterized to have a Be&#8722;Fe bonded Be&#8722;Fe(CO)4&#8722; structure with C3v symmetry and all of the four carbonyl ligands bonded on the iron center. Quantum chemical studies indicate that the complex has a quite short Be&#8722;Fe bond. Besides one electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two additional, albeit weak, Be &#8592; Fe(CO)4&#8722; dative &#960; bonding interactions. The findings imply that metal&#8211;metal bonding between s&#8208;block and transition metals is viable under suitable coordination environment.

         <title>Probing Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts and Catalytic Reaction Processes by Shell&#8208;Isolated Nanoparticle&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9306-9310, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly sensitive Raman strategy has been developed to characterize the structure and surface species of single&#8208;atom catalysts. Catalytic reaction processes on single&#8208;atom catalysts were monitored in&#8197;situ using shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
Developing advanced characterization techniques for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is of great significance to identify their structural and catalytic properties. Raman spectroscopy can provide molecular structure information, and thus, the technique is a promising tool for catalysis. However, its application in SACs remains a great challenge because of its low sensitivity. We develop a highly sensitive strategy that achieves the characterization of the structure of SACs and in&#8197;situ monitoring of the catalytic reaction processes on them by shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) for the first time. Using the strategy, Pd SACs on different supports were identified by Raman spectroscopy and the nucleation process of Pd species from single atoms to nanoparticles was revealed. Moreover, the catalytic reaction processes of the hydrogenation of nitro compounds on Pd SACs were monitored in&#8197;situ, and molecular insights were obtained to uncover the unique catalytic properties of SACs. This work provides a new spectroscopic tool for the in&#8197;situ study of SACs, especially at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces.

The integration of scaffold&#8208;free modules to scaffolded DNA origami results in a hybrid architecture.







Abstract
The scaffolded DNA origami approach and the scaffold&#8208;free LEGO approach both demonstrate an extraordinary self&#8208;assembly capability for constructing all kinds of complex DNA nanostructures. Combining the construction elements of the two approaches, we introduce a hybrid framework to build wireframe structures in this study. A collection of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) wireframe structures are presented to showcase the simple and versatile design. Our development reveals more of the ever&#8208;expanding design space of structural DNA nanotechnology.

Abstract
An efficient general strategy for the synthesis of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids via the rapid construction of a common core intermediate has been established, based on which a divergent total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphenylline and (&#8722;)&#8208;himalensine&#8197;A has been accomplished in 16 and 19 steps, respectively. The present work features an enantioselective Mg(ClO4)2&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular amidocyclization to construct the aza&#8208;bridged core structure; a Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclopropanation and subsequent phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Cope&#8208;type rearrangement to furnish the himalensine&#8197;A scaffold; and a one&#8208;pot Diels&#8211;Alder/aromatization method to assemble the aromatic skeleton of daphenylline.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides from Glycosyl Esters via C&#8722;O Bond Homolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9433-9438, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to synthesize C&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides from glycosyl esters is reported. The reaction is particularly useful for preparing &#946;&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues, leveraging the photoredox activation of dihydropyridine and decarboxylation to homolytically cleave C&#8722;O bonds and afford glycosyl radicals.







Abstract
C&#8208;aryl glycosyl compounds offer better in vivo stability relative to O&#8208; and N&#8208;glycoside analogues. C&#8208;aryl glycosides are extensively investigated as drug candidates and applied to chemical biology studies. Previously, C&#8208;aryl glycosides were derived from lactones, glycals, glycosyl stannanes, and halides, via methods displaying various limitations with respect to the scope, functional&#8208;group compatibility, and practicality. Challenges remain in the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars from easily accessible carbohydrate precursors. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;coupling method to prepare C&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides, including nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars, from glycosyl esters and bromoarenes. Activation of the carbohydrate substrates leverages dihydropyridine (DHP) as an activating group followed by decarboxylation to generate a glycosyl radical via C&#8722;O bond homolysis. This strategy represents a new means to activate alcohols as a cross&#8208;coupling partner. The convenient preparation of glycosyl esters and their stability exemplifies the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>The Acidities of Nucleophilic Monofluoromethylation Reagents: An&#8201;Anomalous &#945;&#8208;Fluorine Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9401-9406, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acidities of the most popular nucleophilic monofluoromethylating reagents have been measured by Bordwell's classical overlapping indicator method. This has led to the disclosure of an anomalous &#945;&#8208;fluorine effect on the C&#8211;H acidity.







Abstract
Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is expected to lower the pKa of neighboring functionality via its strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, and this strategy has been widely exploited in diverse disciplines. Herein, we report a striking anomalous &#945;&#8208;fluorine substitution effect on the &#945;&#8208;Csp3&#8208;H acidity. We have experimentally measured the pKa values of a series of popular nucleophilic monofluoromethylating reagents &#945;&#8208;fluoro(phenylsulfonyl)methane derivatives as well as their C&#8208;H analogues by Bordwell's overlapping indicator method in dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Contrary to expectations, we found that &#945;&#8208;fluorine substituent does not generally enhance but rather weaken the &#945;&#8208;Csp3&#8208;H acidity of most (phenylsulfonyl)methane derivatives. DFT computations reproduce and provide insight into the anomalous &#945;&#8208;fluorine effect. A correlation was identified between the C&#8208;H pKa of (phenylsulfonyl)methane derivatives and Mayr's nucleophilicity parameter (N) of the corresponding carbanions.

         <title>n&#8208;Type Rigid Semiconducting Polymers Bearing Oligo(Ethylene Glycol) Side Chains for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9368-9373, April 19, 2021. </description>

Two new n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers, PgNaN and PgNgN, bearing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chain are developed with a fully conformationally locked backbone and deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. As a result, the polymer of PgNaN exhibits a good performance on OECT devices with a maximum dimensionally normalized transconductance of 0.212&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a product &#956;C* of 0.662&#177;0.113&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
N&#8208;type conjugated polymers as the semiconducting component of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are still undeveloped with respect to their p&#8208;type counterparts. Herein, we report two rigid n&#8208;type conjugated polymers bearing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains, PgNaN and PgNgN, which demonstrated an essentially torsion&#8208;free &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone. The planarity and electron&#8208;deficient rigid structures enable the resulting polymers to achieve high electron mobility in an OECT device of up to the 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range, with a deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level lower than &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. Prominently, the polymers exhibited a high device performance with a maximum dimensionally normalized transconductance of 0.212&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and the product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility &#956; and volumetric capacitance C* of 0.662&#177;0.113&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which are among the highest in n&#8208;type conjugated polymers reported to date. Moreover, the polymers are synthesized via a metal&#8208;free aldol&#8208;condensation polymerization, which is beneficial to their application in bioelectronics.

Chiral C&#8722;N axis is efficiently set up through an NHC organocatalytic atroposelective cycloaddition reaction, with axially chiral thiazine molecules obtained in excellent optical purities.







Abstract
A catalytic atroposelective cycloaddition reaction between thioureas and ynals is developed. This reaction features the first NHC&#8208;catalyzed addition of thioureas to acetylenic acylazolium intermediates to eventually set up C&#8722;N axial chirality with excellent optical purities. The obtained axially chiral thiazine derivative products bear multiple functional groups and are feasible for further transformations.

         <title>Boosting the Electrocatalysis of MXenes by Plasmon&#8208;Induced Thermalization and Hot&#8208;Electron Injection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9416-9420, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic activity of MXenes can be boosted by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The resulting intense photothermal effect and hot&#8208;electron injection reduces the endothermic enthalpy, activation energy, and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the hydrogen evolution reaction on various types of MXenes over a broad pH range.







Abstract
The MXenes attract great interest in catalytic and energy applications but suffer from inferior redox activity. An efficient strategy is presented to boost the intrinsic electrochemical activity of MXenes for electrocatalysis in various chemical environments by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The resulting significant thermoplasmonic effect lowers the endothermic enthalpy and potential barrier to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the Vis/near&#8208;IR region. Simultaneous hot&#8208;electron injection in a prolonged sub&#8208;femtosecond to picosecond timescale also remarkably facilitates interfacial charge transfer and decreases the activation energy of the reaction. Both effects boost the HER activity of various types of MXenes over fivefold with improved kinetics and Faradaic efficiency over a broad pH range.

         <title>A Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework Exhibiting Band&#8208;like Transport with Ultrahigh Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9321-9325, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivate was used to construct a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1). Extended conjugated structures are facilitated for electron delocalization and transport, furnishing BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with semiconducting properties. Pellet samples of BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibited ultrahigh Hall electron mobility up to &#8776;3.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and demonstrated band&#8208;like charge transport character.







Abstract
Although &#960;&#8208;conjugated two dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively reported, developing fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COFs is still an extremely difficult problem due to the lack of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D linkers. We synthesize a fully conjugated 3D COF (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1) by designing a saddle&#8208;shaped building block of aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene (COThP)&#8208;CHO. As a consequence of the fully conjugated 3D network, BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 demonstrates ultrahigh Hall electron mobility up to &#8776;3.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is one order of magnitude higher than the current &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D COFs. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements reveal that the charge carriers in BUCT&#8208; COF&#8208;1 exhibit the band&#8208;like transport mechanism, which is entirely different from the hopping transport phenomena observed in common organic materials. The findings indicate that fully conjugated 3D COFs can achieve electron delocalization and charge&#8208;transport pathways within the whole 3D skeleton, which may open up a new frontier in the design of organic semiconducting materials.

         <title>Transforming a Fluorochrome to an Efficient Photocatalyst for Oxidative Hydroxylation: A Supramolecular Dimerization Strategy Based on Host&#8208;Enhanced Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9384-9388, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient fluorochrome was transformed into a high&#8208;performance photocatalyst through the facile fabrication of supramolecular dimer. Owing to the host&#8208;enhanced charge transfer interaction, the intersystem crossing was promoted and the followed electron transfer was facilitated. Therefore, the supramolecular dimer exhibited excellent photocatalytic property for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
The development of non&#8208;covalent synthetic strategy to fabricate efficient photocatalysts is of great importance in theranostic and organic materials. Herein, a fluorochrome N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridinium)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazolediiodide (MPT) was transformed into an efficient photocatalyst through supramolecular dimerization in the cavity of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]). The host&#8208;enhanced charge transfer interaction within the supramolecular dimer 2MPT&#8208;CB[8] dramatically promoted intersystem crossing to produce triplet. In addition, the staggered conformation of 2MPT&#8208;CB[8] facilitated the energy transfer and electron transfer of the triplet. As a result, 2MPT&#8208;CB[8] could serve as a high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. This supramolecular dimerization strategy enriches the supramolecular engineering of functional &#960;&#8208;systems. It is anticipated that this strategy can be extended to fabricate various &#960;&#8208;systems with tailor&#8208;made functions.

         <title>s&#8208;Block Multiple Bonds: Isolation of a Beryllium Imido Complex</title>

The first s&#8208;block metal&#8208;nitrogen double bond is synthesized! The shortest beryllium&#8208;nitrogen bond has been prepared via oxidation of Be0.







Abstract
A common feature of d&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements is that they participate in multiple bonding. In contrast, the synthesis of compounds containing homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;nuclear multiple bonds involving s&#8208;block elements is extremely rare. Herein, we report the synthesis, molecular structure, and computational analysis of a beryllium imido (Be=N) complex (2), which was prepared via oxidation of a molecular Be0 precursor (1) with trimethylsilyl azide Me3SiN3 (TMS&#8208;N3). Notably, compound 2 features the shortest known Be=N bond (1.464&#8197;&#197;) to date. This represents the first compound with an s&#8208;block metal&#8208;nitrogen multiple bond. All compounds were characterized experimentally with multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 9Be) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The bonding situation was analyzed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which supports the existence of &#960;&#8208;bonding between beryllium and nitrogen.

         <title>Enantioselective Alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Gold(I)&#8208;Cavitands: Total Synthesis of Mafaicheenamine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 17, Page 9339-9344, April 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes was designed and applied to the development of the first enantioselective alkoxycyclization of phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes, giving high enantioselectivities and excellent yields. This approach was used for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C. The cavity effect was studied theoretically supporting the high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes have been developed for the enantioselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This enantioselective cyclization has been applied for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C and its enantiomer, establishing its configuration as&#8197;R. The cavity effect was also evaluated in the cycloisomerization of dienynes. A combination of experiments and theoretical studies demonstrates that the cavity of the gold(I) complexes forces the enynes to adopt constrained conformations, which results in the high observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.

     alt="Enantioselective Alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Gold(I)&#8208;Cavitands: Total Synthesis of Mafaicheenamine C"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new family of chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes was designed and applied to the development of the first enantioselective alkoxycyclization of phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes, giving high enantioselectivities and excellent yields. This approach was used for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C. The cavity effect was studied theoretically supporting the high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes have been developed for the enantioselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This enantioselective cyclization has been applied for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C and its enantiomer, establishing its configuration as&#8197;R. The cavity effect was also evaluated in the cycloisomerization of dienynes. A combination of experiments and theoretical studies demonstrates that the cavity of the gold(I) complexes forces the enynes to adopt constrained conformations, which results in the high observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cephalodiones A&#8211;D: Compound Characterization and Semisynthesis by [6+6] Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical study on a Cephalotaxus plant led to the characterization of four unprecedented C19&#8208;norditerpenoid dimers, named cephalodiones A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4). These compounds were proposed to be biosynthetically formed through [6+6]&#8208;cycloaddition of two C19&#8208;norditerpenoid troponoids either C2&#8208;symmetrically or asymmetrically, which was validated by the semisyntheses of 2&#8211;4. Some compounds showed significant inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation.







Abstract
Cephalodiones A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), the first example of C19&#8208;norditerpenoid dimers, were isolated and fully characterized from a Cephalotaxus plant. These new skeletal natural products shared a unique tricyclo[6.4.1.12,7]tetradeca&#8208;3,5,9,11&#8208;tetraene&#8208;13,14&#8208;dione core that was capped in both ends with rigid multicyclic ring systems either C2&#8208;symmetrically or asymmetrically. Compounds 1&#8211;4 were proposed to be biosynthetically produced by the [6+6]&#8208;cycloaddition of two identical C19&#8208;norditerpenoid troponoids, which was validated by the semisyntheses of dimers 2&#8211;4. Moreover, some compounds showed significant inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation.

         <title>Electrophotocatalytic C&#8722;H Heterofunctionalization of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophotocatalytic C&#8722;H heterofunctionalization of arenes with high chemoselectivity under both batch and flow conditions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrophotocatalytic heterofunctionalization of arenes is described. Using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyanoquinone (DDQ) under a mild electrochemical potential with visible&#8208;light irradiation, arenes undergo oxidant&#8208;free hydroxylation, alkoxylation, and amination with high chemoselectivity. In addition to batch reactions, an electrophotocatalytic recirculating flow process is demonstrated, enabling the conversion of benzene to phenol on a gram scale.

         <title>ITQ&#8208;69: A Germanium&#8208;Containing Zeolite and its Synthesis, Structure Determination, and Adsorption Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
ITQ&#8208;69 has been synthesized, characterized, and its application as selective adsorbent for light olefins/paraffins has been tested.







Abstract
In this work, a new zeolite named as ITQ&#8208;69, has been synthesized, characterized and its application as selective adsorbent for industrially relevant light olefins/paraffins separations has been assessed. This material has been obtained as pure germania as well as silica&#8208;germania zeolites with different Si/Ge ratios using a diquaternary ammonium cation as organic structure directing agent. Its structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction showing a triclinic unit cell forming a tridirectional small pore channel system (8&#215;8&#215;8R). Also, it has been found that Si preferentially occupies some special T sites of the structure as deduced from Rietveld analysis of the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. In addition, the new zeolite ITQ&#8208;69 has been found to be stable upon calcination and thus, its adsorption properties were evaluated, showing a promising kinetic selectivity for light olefin separations in the C3 fraction.

         <title>Steric Hindrance in Metal Coordination Drives the Separation of Pyridine Regioisomers Using Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble RhII&#8208;MOPs have been implemented in liquid&#8211;liquid extraction systems to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers. A steric hindrance&#8208;driven mechanism has been harnessed to selectively coordinate one regioisomer to the exohedral position of the dirhodium paddlewheel thus generating a solubility difference between the coordinated and the non&#8208;coordinated pyridine. This mechanism was elucidated through molecular dynamics and wet experiments.







Abstract
The physicochemical similarity of isomers makes their chemical separation through conventional techniques energy intensive. Herein, we report that, instead of using traditional encapsulation&#8208;driven processes, steric hindrance in metal coordination on the outer surface of RhII&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) can be used to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction. Through molecular dynamics simulations and wet experiments, we discovered that the capacity of pyridines to coordinatively bind to Rh&#8208;MOPs is determined by the positions of the pyridine substituents relative to the pyridine nitrogen and is influenced by steric hindrance. Thus, we exploited the differential solubility of bound and non&#8208;bound pyridine regioisomers to engineer liquid&#8211;liquid self&#8208;sorting systems. As a proof of concept, we separated four different equimolecular mixtures of regioisomers, including a mixture of the industrially relevant compounds 2&#8208;chloropyridine and 3&#8208;chloropyridine, isolating highly pure compounds in all cases.

         <title>A General Supramolecular Approach to Regulate Protein Functions by Cucurbit[7]uril and Unnatural Amino Acid Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal supramolecular host&#8211;guest recognition strategy was developed for reversible regulation of protein function at the single residue level. A guest molecule that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril was genetically encoded into proteins. Reversible regulation of enzyme function and cell activity was achieved when this strategy was applied to two enzymes and a cytokine.







Abstract
Regulation of specific protein function is of great importance for both research and therapeutic development. Many small or large molecules have been developed to control specific protein function, but there is a lack of a universal approach to regulate the function of any given protein. We report a general host&#8211;guest molecular recognition approach involving modification of the protein functional surfaces with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids bearing guest side chains that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril. Using two enzymes and a cytokine as models, we showed that the activity of proteins bearing unnatural amino acid could be turned off by host molecule binding, which blocked its functional binding surface. Protein activity can be switched back by treatment with a competitive guest molecule. Our approach provides a general tool for reversibly regulating protein function through molecular recognition and can be expected to be valuable for studying protein functions.

     alt="A General Supramolecular Approach to Regulate Protein Functions by Cucurbit[7]uril and Unnatural Amino Acid Recognition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal supramolecular host&#8211;guest recognition strategy was developed for reversible regulation of protein function at the single residue level. A guest molecule that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril was genetically encoded into proteins. Reversible regulation of enzyme function and cell activity was achieved when this strategy was applied to two enzymes and a cytokine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation of specific protein function is of great importance for both research and therapeutic development. Many small or large molecules have been developed to control specific protein function, but there is a lack of a universal approach to regulate the function of any given protein. We report a general host&#8211;guest molecular recognition approach involving modification of the protein functional surfaces with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids bearing guest side chains that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril. Using two enzymes and a cytokine as models, we showed that the activity of proteins bearing unnatural amino acid could be turned off by host molecule binding, which blocked its functional binding surface. Protein activity can be switched back by treatment with a competitive guest molecule. Our approach provides a general tool for reversibly regulating protein function through molecular recognition and can be expected to be valuable for studying protein functions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Proton Capture Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Atomically Dispersed Metal&#8211;Nitrogen Active Sites**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton capture strategy was developed to assist atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen active sites for accelerating reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts play a key role in accelerating the sluggish electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer. We now develop a proton capture strategy by accelerating the water dissociation reaction catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal nanoparticles (NPs) adjacent to atomically dispersed and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single nickel (Ni&#8722;Nx) active sites to accelerate proton transfer to the latter for boosting the intermediate protonation step, and thus the whole ECR process. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and calculations reveal that the Ni NPs accelerate the adsorbed H (Had) generation and transfer to the adjacent Ni&#8722;Nx sites for boosting the intermediate protonation and the overall ECR processes. This proton capture strategy is universal to design and prepare for various high&#8208;performance catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions even beyond ECR.

         <title>Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Chemoselective Hydroboration of Isocyanates: Amide Bond Formation and C=O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zinc&#8208;catalyzed selective reduction of isocyanates via hydroboration is reported for the first time. Amide bond formation by the chemoselective reduction of isocyanates and hydrodeoxygenation of isocyanates to secondary methyl amine have been described.







Abstract
Herein, a remarkable conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) supported zinc hydride, [{LZnH}2; L={(ArHN)(ArN)&#8722;C=N&#8722;C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar=2,6&#8208;Et2&#8208;C6H3}] (I) catalyzed partial reduction of heteroallenes via hydroboration is reported. A large number of aryl and alkyl isocyanates, including electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups, undergo reduction to obtain selectively N&#8208;boryl formamide, bis(boryl) hemiaminal and N&#8208;boryl methyl amine products. The compound I effectively catalyzes the chemoselective reduction of various isocyanates, in which the construction of the amide bond occurs. Isocyanates undergo a deoxygenation hydroboration reaction, in which the C=O bond cleaves, leading to N&#8208;boryl methyl amines. Several functionalities such as nitro, cyano, halide, and alkene groups are well&#8208;tolerated. Furthermore, a series of kinetic, control experiments and structurally characterized intermediates suggest that the zinc hydride species are responsible for all reduction steps and breaking the C=O bond.

         <title>Biogenesis&#8208;Guided Synthesis and Structural Revision of Sarocladione Enabled by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Endoperoxide Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By studying sarocladione biosynthesis, we accomplished its chemical synthesis from ergosterol in two or seven steps and revised the published structure of this compound, which is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid isolated from a natural source. This work was enabled by development of a general method for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by dual C&#8722;C bond cleavage.







Abstract
Sarocladione is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid with a 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diketone framework to have been isolated from a natural source. Herein we report a biomimetic synthesis of sarocladione in only two or seven steps from inexpensive, commercially available ergosterol. The key feature of this synthesis was a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed various saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by cleavage of two C&#8722;C bonds. This synthesis allowed us to unambiguously determine the structure of sarocladione and provided experimental support for its revised biosynthetic origin. This work also vividly demonstrates that consideration of the biogenesis is a powerful tool for elucidating the structures of natural products.

         <title>Studies on the Lithiation, Borylation, and 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement of O&#8208;Cycloalkyl 2,4,6&#8208;Triisopropylbenzoates</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;cycloalkyl benzoates were studied to understand their ability to undergo a lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction. Ring size was the key feature: too large and the system could not be lithiated; too small and the system could not undergo 1,2&#8208;migration. The cyclobutyl system occupies a &#8220;Goldilock's zone&#8221; where the lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction works well and shows broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A broad range of acyclic primary and secondary 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoate (TIB) esters have been used in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions, but cyclic TIB esters have not. We have studied the use of cyclic TIB esters in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions and looked at the effect of ring size (3&#8208; &#8594; 6&#8208;membered rings) on the three key steps of the lithiation&#8208;borylation protocol: deprotonation, borylation and 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Although all rings sizes could be deprotonated, the cyclohexyl case was impractically slow, and the cyclopentyl example underwent &#945;&#8208;elimination faster than deprotonation at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C and so could not be used. Both cyclobutyl and cyclopropyl cases underwent rapid borylation, but only the cyclobutyl substrate underwent 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Thus, the cyclobutyl TIB ester occupies a &#8220;Goldilocks zone,&#8221; being small enough for deprotonation and large enough to enable 1,2&#8208;migration. The generality of the reaction was explored with a broad range of boronic esters.

         <title>Direct Mapping of Phospholipid Ferroptotic Death Signals in Cells and Tissues by Gas Cluster Ion Beam Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS) imaging with a 70&#8197;keV (H2O)n+ (n&gt;28&#8201;000) cluster ion beam mapped peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) with 1.2&#8197;&#956;m spatial resolution at the single cell/subcellular level. This visualized low abundance peroxidized lipids in ferroptotic H9c2 cardiomyocytes and cortical/hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury.







Abstract
Peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) species have been identified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) as predictive biomarkers of ferroptosis, a new program of regulated cell death. However, the presence and subcellular distribution of PEox in specific cell types and tissues have not been directly detected by imaging protocols. By applying gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS) imaging with a 70&#8197;keV (H2O)n+ (n&gt;28&#8201;000) cluster ion beam, we were able to map PEox with 1.2&#8197;&#956;m spatial resolution at the single cell/subcellular level in ferroptotic H9c2 cardiomyocytes and cortical/hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) species have been identified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) as predictive biomarkers of ferroptosis, a new program of regulated cell death. However, the presence and subcellular distribution of PEox in specific cell types and tissues have not been directly detected by imaging protocols. By applying gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS) imaging with a 70&#8197;keV (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (n&amp;gt;28&#8201;000) cluster ion beam, we were able to map PEox with 1.2&#8197;&#956;m spatial resolution at the single cell/subcellular level in ferroptotic H9c2 cardiomyocytes and cortical/hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury. Application of this protocol affords visualization of physiologically relevant levels of very low abundance (20&#8197;pmol&#8201;&#956;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; lipid) peroxidized lipids in subcellular compartments and their accumulation in disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tunable Hollow Nanoreactors for In Situ Synthesis of GeP Electrodes towards High&#8208;Performance Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique structure of hollow nanoreactors is designed for in situ synthesis of GeP electrodes. Such size&#8208;tunable nanoreactors not only ensure sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport but also restrain the crystal growth and accommodate the volume expansion of GeP, consequently leading to superior sodium storage performance.







Abstract
The practical application of germanium phosphide (GeP) in battery systems is seriously impeded referring to the sluggish reaction kinetics and severe volume change. Nanostructure design that elaborately resolves the above issues is highly desired but still remains a big challenge. Herein, unique hollow nanoreactors assembled with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon networks for in situ synthesis of the GeP electrodes are proposed for the first time. Such nanoreactors form a self&#8208;supported conductive network, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport. They restrain crystal growth and accommodate the volume expansion of GeP simultaneously. Reaction kinetics and confinement effect are optimized through nanoreactor size regulation. The optimized GeP electrode has high reversible capacities and outstanding cyclability and rate performance for sodium storage, outperforming most previously reported phosphides.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Nanoprinting for the Assembly of Plasmonic Nanostructures with Single&#8208;Molecule Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami&#8208;based nanoprinting can transfer DNA strands with predefined sequences and positions to gold nanocube surfaces to create the stereo&#8208;controlled metallic nanostructures with controlled geometry and composition. By anchoring the single dye molecule in hot spot regions, the dramatic enhanced electromagnetic field aroused stronger SERS signal amplification.







Abstract
Metallic nanocube ensembles exhibit tunable localized surface plasmon resonance to induce the light manipulation at the subwavelength scale. Nevertheless, precisely control anisotropic metallic nanocube ensembles with relative spatial directionality remains a challenge. Here, we report a DNA origami based nanoprinting (DOBNP) strategy to transfer the essential DNA strands with predefined sequences and positions to the surface of the gold nanocubes (AuNCs). These DNA strands ensured the specific linkages between AuNCs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that generating the stereo&#8208;controlled AuNC&#8208;AuNP nanostructures (AANs) with controlled geometry and composition. By anchoring the single dye molecule in hot spot regions, the dramatic enhanced electromagnetic field aroused stronger surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal amplification. Our approach opens the opportunity for the fabrication of stereo&#8208;controlled metal nanostructures for designing highly sensitive photonic devices.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Stimulated Efficient Photocatalytic N2 Fixation over Defective BaTiO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model ferroelectric photocatalyst, BaTiO3, was treated with NaBH4 to introduce surface oxygen vacancies (Ov&#8208;BTO). The resultant material offers spin&#8208;polarized regulation and an increased internal electric field (IEF). The function of Ov&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity under an external magnetic field is explored and the positive effect of the external magnetic field phenomenon demonstrated on photocatalytic N2 fixation.







Abstract
Efficient coupling solar energy conversion and N2 fixation by photocatalysis has been shown promising potentials. However, the unsatisfied yield rate of NH3 curbs its forward application. Defective typical perovskite, BaTiO3, shows remarkable activity under an applied magnetic field for photocatalytic N2 fixation with an NH3 yield rate exceeding 1.93&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through steered surface spin states and oxygen vacancies, the electromagnetic synergistic effect between the internal electric field and an external magnetic field is stimulated. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the regulation of electronic and magnetic properties through manipulation of oxygen vacancies and inducement of Lorentz force and spin selectivity effect. The electromagnetic effect suppresses the recombination of photoexcited carriers in semiconducting nanomaterials, which acts synergistically to promote N2 adsorption and activation while facilitating fast charge separation under UV&#8208;vis irradiation.

         <title>Understanding the Reduction of Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphates to Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphides by Combining Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reduction and Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of PH3 and the reaction of PH3 with H2O, which can be important reasons that excess phosphorus is needed for the reduction of nickel phosphate to Ni2P.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;programmed reduction of transition&#8208;metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature&#8208;programmed reduction&#8208;infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR&#8208;IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH3 and Pn+ species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200&#8201;&#176;C), and PH3 was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH3 and Pn+ during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH3 and Pn+. These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni2P, and also demonstrate that the TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.
