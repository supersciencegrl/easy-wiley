         <title>Ion&#8208;Docking Effect Enabling Rechargeable High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium&#8208;Iodine/Chlorine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries represent a promising energy storage system by offering low cost and dendrite&#8208;less propensity. However, the limited selection of cathode materials, and often with low voltage and capacity, constrain Mg batteries. Herein, by exploiting the ion&#8208;docking effect between two halogen species &#8212; iodine cations (I+) and chlorine anions (Cl&#8208;) &#8212; we activate the cathodic activity of halogens and develop a magnesium&#8208;iodine/chlorine (Mg&#8208;I/Cl) battery prototype with high energy and power density. The ion&#8208;docking effect enables I+ and Cl&#8208; to mutually balance and disperse their charges, weakens the coordination strength between Cl&#8208; and Mg2+ while enhances the stability of I+, thus facilitating the multi&#8208;electron (2+1/3) redox reactions of halogens. We also find the solvation state of iodine species determine the reaction process of the I0/I3&#8208;/I&#8208; redox couples. The here&#8208;developed magnesium&#8208;iodine/chlorine battery features an impressively high discharge plateau of up to 3.0 V with a high capacity exceeding 400 mAh g&#8208;1, and demonstrates a stable lifespan for 500 cycles, with the ability of ultra&#8208;fast charging at 20C and low&#8208;temperature cycling under &#8208;30 &#176;C. These findings may provide new insights for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Mg battery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Zn2+ Ferrying Effect with Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction to Mitigate Space Charge Layer Enables Ultra&#8208;High Utilization Rate Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major dilemma faced by Zn anodes at high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is the insufficient supply of ionic carriers that initiate the space charge layer (SCL) subject to rampant growth of Zn dendrites. Herein, an &#8216;anion&#8208;cation co&#8208;regulation&#8217; strategy, associated with a fundamental principle for screening potential electrolyte additives coupling the Zn2+ ferrying effect with anion&#8208;retention capability, are&#160;put forward to construct dendrite&#8208;free, high&#8208;ZUR Zn anode. Taking ninhydrin&#8208;modified ZnSO4 system as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the multiple zincophilic polar groups of ninhydrin facilitate the transport of Zn2+ ions while its electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ring retains SO42&#8208; counterions via anion&#8208;&#960; interaction, constructing an ion&#8208;rich interface that minimizes the SCL&#8208;driven Zn deterioration. Consequently, the Zn anode can endure ~240 h continuous cycling at an ultrahigh ZUR of 87.3%. The superiority brought by ninhydrin is further reflected by the ultralong cycling durability of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (over 100000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1, ~20&#8208;fold lifespan extension). Even at an ultralow N/P ratio of 1.1 (~90.6% ZUR), the battery with a capacity of ~5.27 mAh cm&#8208;2 can still sustain for 350 cycles, which has been hardly achieved in aqueous Zn batteries. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this strategy is fully validated by a series of additives sharing similar fundamentals.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Redox Shotgun Proteomics Reveals Specific Lipopolysaccharide Effects on Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Mitigated by a Mn Superoxide Dismutase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomics and redoxomics are efficient to quantify the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in intestinal epithelial cells (HT29) at the proteome and at the Cys&#8208;redoxome levels. Oxidative stress is the initial trigger of LPS leading to inflammation. A Mn&#8208;based superoxide mimetic (or mimic) was able to reduce oxidative stress and to mitigate the effects at the proteome level.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) dysregulation contribute to chronic inflammation such as generated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A kinetic redox shotgun proteomic strategy (OcSILAC for Oxidized cysteine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) was used to explore the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects including LPS&#8208;induced oxidation and inflammation cascades on a dedicated intestinal epithelial cell line (HT29&#8208;MD2) together with the potential mitigating role of a Mn&#8208;based SOD&#8208;mimic Mn1. While LPS induced transient oxidative damages at early times (15&#160;min), cells incubated with Mn1 showed, in this time frame, a significantly reduced cysteine oxidation, highlighting Mn1 antioxidant properties. Over time, cysteine oxidation of LPS&#8208;treated cells was counteracted by an overexpression of antioxidant proteins (SOD1, NQO1) and a late (6&#160;h) preponderant increase in SOD2 level. Mn1, when co&#8208;incubated with LPS, attenuated the level of most LPS&#8208;modified proteins, that is, proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Our results highlight Mn1 as a potentially effective antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent to consider in the treatment of IBD, as well as a useful tool for exploring the interconnection between oxidative stress and inflammation.

         <title>Blocking Orbital &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Boost Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;&#8208;conjugation via either molecular&#8208;structure distortion or meta&#8208;arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters. This work not only provides a deep insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship on SOC but also opens the door for designing more efficient OLED emitters with large SOCs.








Abstract
Both reducing singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES1T1) and enhancing spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOCs) are key to improving reverse intersystem crossing rates (kRISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. While considerable efforts have focused on reducing &#916;ES1T1, investigations on SOCs remain limited. Here, blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) molecules as potential approach to elevate &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, allowing its hybridization with n&#960;* excitation, thereby increasing SOCs is proposed. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomers, DNDK&#8208;1 and DNDK&#8208;2 are synthesized, with different orientations of carbonyl units. DNDK&#8208;1 adopts a heavily twisted structure that hinders &#960;&#8208;conjugation, while DNDK&#8208;2 remains quasi&#8208;planar, maintaining stronger &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Experimental measurements reveals stark differences in their photophysical properties, with DNDK&#8208;1 exhibiting faster kRISC and much higher electroluminescence efficiency. The ab&#8208;initio calculations elucidate that hindered conjugation in DNDK&#8208;1 elevates &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, enabling n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing, thus significantly boosting SOCs. In contrast, smooth &#960;&#8208;conjugation in DNDK&#8208;2 leads to marginal n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing. In addition, utilizing groups composed of meta&#8208;arranged carbonyl&#8208;Ar&#8208;carbonyl and meta&#8208;arranged N&#8208;Ar&#8208;N units emerges as another approach to block &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhance SOCs. This joint experimental and theoretical work provides promising pathways to enhance SOCs by blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation, offering crucial insights for designing carbonyl&#8208;embedded PHA emitters with larger SOCs.

         <title>Construction of Multi&#8208;step Charge Transfer Pathways in Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 for Significantly Accelerated Photoconversion of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoconversion of waste plastics into valuable CO and CH3COOH represents a ground&#8208;breaking strategy for addressing plastic pollution issues. However, this process currently encounters significant challenges, primarily due to the limitation of catalyst activity and the difficulty in breaking C&#8211;C bonds. Herein, we present a novel approach that integrates multi&#8208;step charge transfer pathways with photothermal&#8208;driven reactions to improve photoconversion efficiency. By incorporating Bi0/Bi3+ metal as an electron transport mediator for multi&#8208;step charge transfer, we markedly enhanced the separation and transport of photoelectrons, thereby accelerating the generation of active species. Meanwhile, the heat generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Bi0 drove the reactions related to the photoconversion of polypropylene. Subsequently, the photo&#8208;conversion rates of PP into CO by Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 reached 209.41 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is 27.55 times higher than that achieved with KNbO3. Furthermore, the dual Bi&#8208;Nb sites effectively stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, thereby promoting the production of CH3COOH at a rate of 213.00 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. This strategy of boosting photoconversion activity of PP into CO and CH3COOH offers an effective green solution to the serious issue of plastic pollution.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Low&#8208;Temperature Upcycling of Waste Polyolefins via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of recent advances in mild catalytic transformations of polyolefins, emphasizing the kinetic and thermodynamic interplay between endothermic C&#9472;C bond cleavages and the exothermic formation of new C&#9472;H, C&#9472;C, and C&#9472;O bonds. The aim is to identify existing challenges and potential routes for catalytic conversions that reduce energy consumption and carbon footprints. 








Abstract
Polyolefin waste is the largest polymer waste stream that could potentially serve as an advantageous hydrocarbon feedstock. Upcycling polyolefins poses significant challenges due to their inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Traditional methods, such as thermal and catalytic cracking, are straightforward but require temperatures exceeding 400&#160;&#176;C for complete conversion because of thermodynamic constraints. We summarize and critically compare recent advances in upgrading spent polyolefins and model reactants via kinetic (and thermodynamic) coupling of the endothermic C&#9472;C bond cleavage of polyolefins with exothermic reactions including hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, cyclization, oxidation, and alkylation. These approaches enable complete conversion to desired products at low temperatures (&lt;300&#160;&#176;C). The goal is to identify challenges and possible pathways for catalytic conversions that minimize energy and carbon footprints.

         <title>Biomimetic Localized Gel Electrolyte for Practical Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a biomimetic antifreeze protein localized gel electrolyte (ALGE), which combines electrolyte modification and interface optimization to tackle the challenges of zinc batteries. ALGE suppresses hydrogen evolution and promotes uniform zinc deposition, enabling excellent cycling performance in both symmetric cells and pouch cells. This solution demonstrates scalable potential without relying on costly or exotic materials.








Abstract
Incompatible electrode/electrolyte interface often leads to dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and corrosion, posing significant challenges to the application of Zn anodes. Herein, we introduce a biomimetic antifreeze protein localized gel electrolyte (ALGE) with multifunctional capabilities to address these issues by combining electrolyte modification with interface optimization. ALGE modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure and the hydrogen&#8208;bond network adjacent to the zinc anode, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution. Additionally, ALGE promotes (002)Zn crystal plane&#8208;dominated deposition by protein&#8208;zinc surface interactions, enabling a long&#8208;range dendrite&#8208;free deposition. The absence of by&#8208;products and inhibited corrosion further highlights the practical potential of ALGE. Symmetric cells with ALGE&#8208;modified zinc demonstrate an impressive lifespan of 610&#160;&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The pouch cell integrating a manganese dioxide cathode and ALGE&#8208;modified Zn anode retains 75.8% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This localized gel electrolyte strategy offers a practical and scalable approach to stabilizing Zn anodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>PPh3/Isocyanide and N2/Isocyanide Exchange: Pathways to Isolable Alkali Metal Keteniminyl Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of isolable keteniminyl anions through substitution of the phosphine ligand in metalated ylides or the N&#8322; ligand in diazomethanides with isocyanides is reported. The anions feature a bent geometry, with the angle decreasing with increasing donor ability of the nitrogen substituent, and exhibit broad applicability in the formation of heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions. 








Abstract
Keteniminyl anions hold significant promise for advancing ketenimine chemistry, yet their isolation has remained elusive until now. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in ligand exchange reactions at carbon, we report the successful synthesis of a series of isolable alkali metal keteniminyl anions through substitution of the phosphine ligand in metalated ylides or the N&#8322; ligand in diazomethanides with isocyanides. The exchange reactions were found to proceed more rapidly with aryl isocyanides than with the more electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted derivatives and were also more efficient when starting from the diazo compounds. The resulting keteniminyl anions exhibit bent geometries, which can be attributed to a donor&#8211;acceptor interaction with the isocyanide, giving rise to a carbone&#8208;like structure. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the nitrogen enhance backbonding, thus leading to larger bending angles and a more pronounced ynamide character as also evidenced by a blue&#8208;shifted ketenimine stretch in the IR spectrum. The keteniminyl anions react efficiently with unsaturated compounds to form a diverse array of heterocycles, highlighting their potential as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Semiconductor Spacers with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure Drive 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells Beyond 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites have emerged as promising photovoltaic materials. However, their further improvement in photovoltaic efficiency is hindered by the large dielectric mismatch and high exciton binding energy caused by the insulating spacers. Herein, two semiconductor spacers, namely MeBThMA and CNBThMA, were developed for 2D RP perovskite solar cells. In contrast to MeBThMA, the CNBThMA spacer, which features a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, exhibits a larger dipole moment and adopts a face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking arrangement in the single crystal. The unique D&#8208;A structure effectively eliminates the dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers, contributing the formation of energy levels, adjusting the anisotropic charge transport properties, and improving the film quality of layered RP perovskites. Consequently, the devices based on CNBThMA (nominal n = 5) achieved a champion efficiency of 20.82%, which is a record efficiency for 2D RP PSCs using semiconductor spacers to the best of our knowledge. Our work pioneers a novel way to design organic semiconductor spacers using D&#8208;A structure for highly efficient 2D PSCs.</dc:description>

The N&#8208;H aziridines were obtained with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94%).

         <title>Ethylene Pretreatment Enhances Ethylene Adsorption and Separation over Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) separation using low&#8208;energy technologies is crucial for the chemical industry yet remains challenging due to the lack of industrially applicable adsorbents. Cu(I)&#8208;based adsorbents show significant potential; however, traditional synthesis methods often involve complex procedures or reduction steps. Herein, we report that Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite, synthesized for the first time via a one&#8208;pot method with cyclam as the Cu(II) ligand, exhibits a remarkable C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 22.6, a C2H4 uptake of 3.08 mmol/g, and a separation factor of 9.4 under ambient conditions by using a C2H4 pretreatment, placing it among the best&#8208;performing zeolitic materials. The C2H4 pretreatment enhances separation efficiency by partially reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and water resistance through the formation of carbon species during pretreatment. Structural analysis using Rietveld refinement reveals that Cu2+ ions occupy the corners of elliptical single 8&#8208;rings (s8r). X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) analysis confirms a reduction in Cu oxidation state, while X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) corroborates the partial conversion of Cu(II) to Cu(I). Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that Cu(I) interacts more strongly with C2H4 than Cu(II). With its straightforward synthesis and enhanced performance through C2H4 pretreatment, Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite presents a promising solution for industrial&#8208;scale C2H4/C2H6 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Compacting Molecular Stacking and Inhibiting Self&#8208;Aggregation in Fullerene Transporting Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The underdevelopment of electron transport layer (ETL) materials remains a critical bottleneck limiting the overall photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Fullerene derivatives, such as PCBM, are widely employed ETL materials in PSCs due to their excellent electron affinity and energy level alignment with perovskite layer. However, PCBM suffers from high energy disorder, self&#8208;aggregation predilection, and insufficient defect passivation ability, leading to significant charge carrier recombination and accumulation at interfaces. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed to enhance the performance of PCBM&#8208;based ETLs for PSCs. Incorporating FuPE efficiently compacts molecular stacking, enforces crystallinity and intermolecular interaction, suppresses self&#8208;aggregation and improves interfacial compatibility for the FuPE:PCBM blend. Such endows the FuPE:PCBM blend film with enhanced electron mobility (0.183 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1), lower trap density, more uniform film morphology, and superior defect&#8208;passivation ability, compared to the PCBM pristine one. Consequently, PSCs employing FuPE:PCBM achieve reduced trap&#8208;assisted recombination, enhanced charge carrier extraction, and thus a remarkable power conversion efficiency exceeding 26% alongside improved operational stability. This work highlights an effective strategy for optimizing fullerene&#8208;based ETLs, advancing the development of highly efficient and durable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Fluoride Dual&#8208;atom Synergistic Regulated Interface Coating Enables Stable Zn&#8208;metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;based batteries provide promising opportunities for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, Zn anode encounters severe challenges, such as Zn dendrite formation, surface corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a strategy to spontaneously construct a boron&#8208;fluoride dual&#8208;atom regulated SEI (ZnBOF), which involves the formation of a B&#8208;compound coating through etching process and followed by an in&#8208;situ F substitution during the initial electrochemical cycling. The ZnBOF/Zn anode benefit preferential deposition of Zn2+ along the (002) plane without Zn dendrite, and the side reaction including by&#8208;product and HER are dramatically suppressed. A combination of characterization methods, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, show that the B&#8208;containing passivation layer facilitates the transport of Zn2+ and mitigates water&#8208;related side reactions, and the F atoms serve as zincophilic sites that enhance the transfer kinetics of Zn2+. As expected, the well&#8208;designed ZnBOF/Zn anode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping for 5000 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2. The assembled ZnBOF/Zn||MnO2 batteries show impressive cycling stability, remaining 96.2% of the initial capacity (234.3 mAh g&#8208;1) after 1700 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1. Therefore, this work reveals a dual&#8208;atom synergistic regulated strategy to fabricate a robust SEI for Zn anode, which contributes to the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structurally Simple Polymer Donor Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Minimal Energy Losses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally simple wide bandgap polymer, PBDCT, based on 3,4&#8208;dicyanothiophene, is developed, which is free from halogen substituents and fused ring electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. A record&#8208;breaking low energy loss of 0.476&#160;eV has been obtained, which resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 19.84%, the highest value achieved by halogen&#8208;free polymer donors in binary organic solar cells to date.








Abstract
Energy loss (Eloss) between optical energy gap (Eg) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (eVoc) sets efficiency upper limits for organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, further breaking the limit of Eloss in OSCs is challenging, especially via structurally simple materials in binary OSCs. Herein, a structurally simple nonhalogenated polymer donor, namely PBDCT, is developed for realizing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs with record&#8208;breaking Eloss. The critical building block 3,4&#8208;dicyanothiophene with high electron affinity results in a deep&#8208;lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which effectively reduces radiative and nonradiative recombination energy losses in OSCs. Meanwhile, the finely tuned alkyl chains offer high crystallinity and low energetic disorder for the polymer, which enables efficient exciton dissociation at low energy loss. Moreover, bi&#8208;continuous crystalline fibrillary network structure is formed in the blend consisting of PBDCT due to the optimal aggregation property of the polymer, which is conducive to exciton diffusion and charge transport. Consequently, the OSC with a record&#8208;breaking low Eloss of 0.476&#160;eV has been achieved, which thereby resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.84%, the highest value achieved by nonhalogenated polymer donors in binary OSCs to date. This work demonstrates the prospect of breaking the limit of Eloss and realizing efficiency breakthroughs in OSCs.

         <title>In Situ High Selectivity Contact&#8208;Electroreduction of CO2 to Methanol Using an Imine&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Vitrimer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer catalyst with C&#9552;N bond enables efficient CO2 reduction via contact&#8208;electrocatalysis, driven by water droplet&#8208;induced charges. Imine groups stabilize CO2 adsorption, enrich electrons, and mediate electron transfer, achieving &gt;90% methanol selectivity. The system demonstrates exceptional stability, recyclability, and sustained catalysis, offering a sustainable pathway for CO2 conversion to methanol.








Abstract
Metal catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) face challenges such as high cost, limited durability, and environmental impact. Although various structurally diverse and functional metal&#8208;free catalysts have been developed, they often suffer from slow kinetics, low selectivity, and nonrecyclability, significantly limiting their practical applications. In this study, we introduce a recyclable nonmetallic polymer material (vitrimer) as a catalyst for a new platform in contact&#8208;electrocatalysis. This approach harnesses the contact charges generated between water droplets and vitrimer to drive CO2RR, achieving methanol selectivity exceeding 90%. The imine groups within the vitrimer play a dual role, facilitating CO2 adsorption and enriching friction&#8208;generated electrons, thereby mediating efficient electron transfer between the imine groups and CO2 to promote CO2RR. After 84&#160;h of CO2RR, the system achieved a methanol production rate of 13 nmol&#183;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the excellent stability of the method. Moreover, the vitrimer retains its high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic activity even after recycling. Mechanistic studies reveal that, compared to traditional metal catalysts, the N&#9472;O bond in the imine, which adsorbs the key intermediate *OCH3, breaks more readily to produce methanol, resulting in enhanced product selectivity and yield. This efficient and environmentally friendly contact&#8208;electroreduction strategy for CO2 offers a promising pathway toward a circular carbon economy by leveraging natural water droplet&#8208;based contact&#8208;electrochemistry.

After 84&#160;h of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, the system achieved a methanol production rate of 13 nmol&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating the excellent stability of the method. Moreover, the vitrimer retains its high-performance electrocatalytic activity even after recycling. Mechanistic studies reveal that, compared to traditional metal catalysts, the N&#9472;O bond in the imine, which adsorbs the key intermediate *OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, breaks more readily to produce methanol, resulting in enhanced product selectivity and yield. This efficient and environmentally friendly contact-electroreduction strategy for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; offers a promising pathway toward a circular carbon economy by leveraging natural water droplet-based contact-electrochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Circularity via Chemical Recycling to all Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The initial monomer free energy of polymerization (&#8710;GROP) is traditionally regarded as the benchmark for the polymer's chemical recyclability. But if we instead consider every ring size present at equilibrium (&#8710;GRCE), a different viewpoint emerges. We found that polymers previously regarded as unsuitable for chemical recycling are highly chemically recyclable at low temperatures under the right concentration and catalytic conditions.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) have properties competitive to incumbent plastic (PE, PP), while simultaneously opening up for chemical recycling to monomer (CRM). However, not all aliphatic polyesters are prone to undergo CRM, and the ability to shift the equilibrium between polymer and monomer is tightly associated with the initial monomer structure. The standard strategy to measure CRM is to evaluate the change in free energy during polymerization (&#8710;GROP). However, &#8710;GROP is only one&#8208;dimensional by assessing the equilibrium between initial monomer and polymer. But under active catalytic conditions, the depolymerization of polymers can lead to formation of larger rings, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, and so on, via the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium (RCE), meaning that the real thermodynamic recycling landscape is multi&#8208;dimensional. This work introduces a multi&#8208;dimensional chemical recycling to all rings (CRR) via a highly active catalytic system to reach RCE. Thermodynamically &#8710;GRCE is completely different from &#8710;GROP. Using &#8710;GRCE instead of &#8710;GROP allows us to achieve CRR for polymers notoriously difficult to achieve CRM for, as exemplified within by CRR for poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(pentadecalactone), and mixed polymer systems. Overall, this work provides a new general concept of closing the material loop.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Synthesis by Using Zero&#8208;Valent Metal Powder with Alcohols or Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered the first molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation with inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle zero&#8208;valent metal powders and alcohols or water in the presence of a catalytic amount of samarium compounds, where more than 1000 equiv of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. 








Abstract
We have recently achieved a highly effective ammonia formation from dinitrogen using samarium diiodide and water under ambient reaction conditions. However, further research is needed to establish a carbon&#8208;free green ammonia production route without carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, we have developed a novel molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation method using a combination of zero&#8208;valent metal powders as reductants and alcohols or H2O as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions. In this reaction system, samarium compounds serve as crucial electron mediators for the molybdenum complexes. Remarkably, the combination of zinc powder and water in the presence of samarium triiodide facilitates highly selective ammonia production over dihydrogen under ambient reaction conditions, yielding up to 900 equiv of ammonia per Mo atom in the catalyst. Intriguingly, using magnesium powder, known for its potent reducing capability, reduces the requisite amount of samarium compounds to catalytic levels. We believe that the novel insights gained from this reaction system represent a substantial step toward achieving green ammonia production.

         <title>Explainable Synthesizability Prediction of Inorganic Crystal Polymorphs Using Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized LLMs for structure&#8208;based general synthesizability prediction along with their explanations. Fine&#8208;tuned LLMs and LLM&#8208;embedding&#8208;based bespoke ML models showed promising performance compared to the traditional graph&#8208;based bespoke ML models. Furthermore, fine&#8208;tuned LLMs can provide explainability by inferring the reasons for determining the synthesizability with simple prompts. 








Abstract
We evaluate the ability of machine learning to predict whether a hypothetical crystal structure can be synthesized and explain those predictions to scientists. Fine&#8208;tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human&#8208;readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive&#8208;unlabeled learning model on a text&#8208;embedding representation of the structure. An LLM&#8208;based workflow can then be used to generate human&#8208;readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules. These explanations can guide chemists in modifying or optimizing non&#8208;synthesizable hypothetical structures to make them more feasible for materials design.

         <title>In situ light&#8208;driven pH modulation for NMR studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange is a fundamental chemical event, and NMR provides the most direct readout of protonation events with site&#8208;specific resolution. Conventional approaches require manual titration of sample pH to collect a series of NMR spectra at different pH values. This requires extensive sample handling and often results in significant sample loss, leading to reduced signal or the need to prepare additional samples. Here, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using water soluble photoacids, which alter the pH of the solution from near neutral to acidic pH upon in situ photo&#8208;illumination. We show that the solution pH can be precisely controlled by choice of illumination wavelength and intensity and sufficient protons are released from the photoacid to achieve meaningful pH change in samples where the molecule of interest has significant buffering capacity, such as a &gt;100 &#181;M protein sample. The pH is monitored in situ using internal standards with pH&#8208;sensitive chemical shifts. This method enables precise, calibrated, non&#8208;invasive change of sample pH within an NMR magnet, dramatically reducing the necessary sample handling. These findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control in NMR experiments and increase the robustness and reliability of pH&#8208;dependent studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expansion of Furyl Hydrosilanes: Synthesis of&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxasilines as Diels&#8208;Alder Diene Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new methods for aromatic ring&#8208;expansion offers a strategic means of transforming abundant aromatic feedstocks into intricate structures via skeletal editing, thereby unlocking valuable avenues for organic synthesis. We report herein a mild and efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;expansion of 2&#8208;silylfurans to form 1,2&#8208;oxasilines with wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. DFT calculations suggest the reaction proceeds through regioselective insertion of furan double bond into a Ru&#8211;H bond, followed by skeletal rearrangement, 1,2&#8208;hydride transfer, and elimination steps. The resulting 1,2&#8208;oxasilines are electron&#8208;rich cyclic dienes with an extrusable and transformable Si&#8211;O linker, which exhibit&#160;unique and versatile reactivity in Diels&#8208;Alder cyclization with electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles, enabling modular assembly of molecular skeletons with higher complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Deformation Mode and Amplitude of Liquid Crystal Actuators through Orthogonal Light and Heat&#8208;Induced Exchanges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are versatile soft actuators known for their flexible texture, low density, and ability to undergo reversible deformations that mimic the behavior of skeletal muscles. These properties make them highly attractive for applications in exoskeletons, soft robotics, and medical devices. However, their functionality is typically limited to simple and discontinuous deformations. This study introduces a novel structural design that enables precise control of both the mode and amplitude of deformation. This design integrates photo&#8208;reactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure. The o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties enable irreversible reconfiguration of the LCE crosslinked network through photoreactions, allowing for easy alignment and reshaping of the material. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds act as "temperature&#8208;dependent locks", regulating the mobility of polymer chains during thermal deformation. By adjusting the heating temperature, the deformation amplitude can be finely tuned across a wide range (0~103%). The synergy of these two mechanisms&#8212;light&#8208;induced irreversible reconfiguration and temperature&#8208;induced reversible H&#8208;bond exchanges&#8212;empowers LCEs to achieve customizable and continuous deformations. This represents a significant advancement in bridging the gap between synthetic actuators and biological motion systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are versatile soft actuators known for their flexible texture, low density, and ability to undergo reversible deformations that mimic the behavior of skeletal muscles. These properties make them highly attractive for applications in exoskeletons, soft robotics, and medical devices. However, their functionality is typically limited to simple and discontinuous deformations. This study introduces a novel structural design that enables precise control of both the mode and amplitude of deformation. This design integrates photo-reactive o-nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature-dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure. The o-nitrobenzyl moieties enable irreversible reconfiguration of the LCE crosslinked network through photoreactions, allowing for easy alignment and reshaping of the material. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds act as "temperature-dependent locks", regulating the mobility of polymer chains during thermal deformation. By adjusting the heating temperature, the deformation amplitude can be finely tuned across a wide range (0~103%). The synergy of these two mechanisms&#8212;light-induced irreversible reconfiguration and temperature-induced reversible H-bond exchanges&#8212;empowers LCEs to achieve customizable and continuous deformations. This represents a significant advancement in bridging the gap between synthetic actuators and biological motion systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cation&#8208;in&#8208;Mesopore Complex for 20 Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs) have arisen as one of the most promising safe energy storage solutions, yet practical development, especially for the Ah&#8208;level ZABs, is severely plagued by unmanageable side reactions and notorious dendrite proliferation. Here, we propose a cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore (CiM) complex chemistry by confining Zn2+ within single&#8208;mesopore cavities to construct a novel paradigm of 20 Ah&#8208;level ZABs. Molecule dynamic and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal that the single&#8208;mesopore SiO2 (smSiO2) traps Zn2+, replacing H2O molecules in the primary sheath and forming Zn2+&#8208;smSiO2 complexes. In&#8208;situ electrochemical digital holography, in&#8208;situ interface Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and H&#8208;bonds density analyses clearly confirm that Zn2+&#8208;smSiO2 complexes migrate and adhere onto the metallic Zn, facilitating the formation of mesopore weak H&#8208;bonds interface by disrupting the aggregation of solvated H2O. Consequently, the Zn anode operates over 800 h under 55% depth of discharge, effectively suppressing H2O degradation and dendrite growth. The Zn//VO2 pouch battery demonstrates capacities of 20.5 Ah at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and 8.59 Ah at 1 A g&#8722;1, and energy density of 65 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 96 Wh L&#8722;1. The proposed cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore complex chemistry may mark a substantial step forward towards more sustainable and reliable ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Coupling Electronic&#8211;Ionic Transport in Organic Mixed Conductors as Cathodes for Efficient Zn&#8211;V Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In conventional electrodes, concentration polarization by unbalanced charge transport and solid&#8208;state diffusion resistance result in sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we propose an integrated mixed electronic&#8208;ionic conductor by spatially coupling charge transport pathways, which could achieve redistribution and fast transport of charge (Zn2+/e&#8208;). Operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the charge transport mechanisms and intrinsic conducting characteristics at timescale. Through confinement by vanadium oxide, dual&#8208;conductive pathways were self&#8208;assembled at the nanoscale and provided effective charge storage. This provided high charge density and accelerated ionic diffusion in the bulk phase, resulting in more active sites and faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, reversible ionic channels from self&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping process reduced the dissolution of active materials by protons and enabled conversion chemistry, improving cycling stability at low current density. Consequently, the modulated cathode (PEDOT&#8208;SO3&#8208;ZnVO) delivered a high&#8208;rate performance of 310/148 mAh g&#8208;1 (0.2/10 A g&#8208;1) at 10 mg cm&#8208;2. Importantly, the conventional electrode at 21 mg cm&#8208;2 achieved an ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 6.0 mAh cm&#8208;2 and superior cycling stability (79.1% retention over 100 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8208;1). This work opens the way for the precise modulation of the electrochemical performance of functional nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;entropy environments enable metal surface&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable route to diverse products, minimizing environmental impact. However, conventional 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electrooxidation (HMFOR) catalysts such as Ni(OH)2 and NiS suffer from low conductivity, poor stability, and limited active sites. This work introduces a CoNiMnMoPd high entropy alloy (HEA) to address these limitations by simultaneously maintaining high conductivity, stability, and a high Ni oxidation state, enabling nucleophilic dehydrogenation. The HEA catalyst achieved a 92.5% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) Faradaic efficiency, 89.5% HMF conversion, and 95.8% FDCA selectivity, maintaining performance for over 100 hours. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the multi&#8208;element composition of the HEA enabled Ni sites to maintain a high&#8208;valence state, serving as the primary adsorption sites for HMF, and the dehydrogenation reaction occurs preferentially at non&#8208;Ni sites within the HEA. Compared to monometallic Ni, the d&#8208;band center shift and reduced anti&#8208;bonding filling contributed to a decrease in the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA conversion, from 0.770 eV to 0.567 eV. This work offers novel insights for the development of Ni&#8208;based HEA catalysts for biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple and Rapid Tumor EV Enrichment Enabled by Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided Entanglement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold significant clinical potential for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic agents. However, this field remains underutilized due to the lack of straightforward and versatile techniques for isolating EV subpopulations from biofluids. Here, we present LODGE, a long DNA probe&#8208;guided EV entanglement strategy for the simple, rapid, and selective enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from clinical specimens. LODGE uses two long DNA affinity probes to recognize specific subpopulations, causing them to aggregate with the assistance of splint strands, thereby achieving non&#8208;destructive, high&#8208;yield, and high&#8208;purity separation of tEVs within a short period. Proteomic analysis revealed that the isolated tEVs contributed to the identification of tumor&#8208;associated biomarkers compared to total EVs. Additionally, by incorporating a split G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;containing molecular trap domain, a novel structure that significantly improves the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T (ThT), into DNA affinity probes, we developed an innovative LODGE&#8208;ThT sensing strategy for the highly sensitive profiling of multiple tEV subpopulations. Using data from the tEVs alongside clinical indicators processed with machine learning algorithms, we effectively classified five tumor types. Our results show that LODGE is a promising tool for identifying specific EV subpopulations, fostering their biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Driven Ferroelectric Coordination Polymer Exhibiting Distinct Phase Transitions Under Thermal and Pressure Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first example of a 1D spiro&#8208;based ferroelectric coordination polymer, which exhibits distinct phase transitions under thermal or pressure stimuli, triggered by the flipping of a spiro ring fragment as well as the deformation of the main chain.








Abstract
Controllable strategies for the design of molecular ferroelectrics have been actively pursued in recent years due to their promising applications in modern electronic devices. In this work, we present a spiro&#8208;driven approach for the design of a new class of molecular ferroelectrics. Using 2&#8208;morpholinoethanol (MEO) as a bidentate chelating ligand and the SCN&#8315; anion as a bridging co&#8208;ligand, we obtained a neutral chain&#8208;like ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)&#8322;]. Interestingly, it undergoes both a thermal&#8208;induced phase transition, driven by ring&#8208;conformational flipping of the spiro&#8208;like [Cd(MEO)] fragment, and a pressure&#8208;induced transition, triggered by significant deformation of the spring&#8208;like [Cd(SCN)&#8322;]&#8734; helical chain. Unlike most previously reported ferroelectric coordination polymers, which often rely on organic cationic guests, this work introduces a new avenue for designing neutral ferroelectric coordination polymers. Overall, the spiro&#8208;driven strategy provides valuable insights and a novel structural motif for the development of advanced molecular ferroelectrics.

In this work, we present a spiro-driven approach for the design of a new class of molecular ferroelectrics.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Reinventing the High&#8208;rate Energy Storage of Hard Carbon: the Order&#8208;degree Governs the Trade&#8208;off of Desolvation&#8211;Solid Electrolyte Interphase at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trade&#8208;off (represented by the seesaw in the cover picture) between solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation is linked to the structural feature of hard carbon for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, as demonstrated by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202425507). In a more disordered state, desolvation and the SEI work in concert. The desolvation process is progressively enhanced with increasing structural ordering.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: A Metastable State Facilitates Low Temperature CO Oxidation over Pt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable surface states play a crucial yet poorly understood role in catalysis. However, they are difficult to isolate and even harder to identify. In their Communication (e202423880), Christian Reece et al. successfully isolate and identify a highly active metastable surface state over Pt nanoparticles, which forms after CO desorbs from well&#8208;coordinated Pt sites. The cover image is a stylised representation of how this state emerges following CO desorption.

         <title>Enhancing Immune Responses Through Modulation of Innate Cell Microenvironments in Lymph Nodes with Virus&#8208;Mimetic Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a versatile platform for co&#8208;delivering antigens and adjuvants, termed virus&#8208;mimetic vaccines (VMVs). VMVs drain into the lymph nodes, recruiting and activating multiple antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), including CD8+ and CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and neutrophils. This process modulates the innate cell environments, enhancing immune responses.








Abstract
Nanovaccines hold significant promise for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of many nanovaccines is often limited by inadequate stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Herein, we explore a rational vaccine strategy aimed at modulating innate cell microenvironments within lymph nodes (LNs) to enhance the generation of effective immune responses. Inspired by the structure and natural infection process of viruses, we developed a versatile antigen and adjuvant co&#8208;delivery platform, termed virus&#8208;mimetic vaccines (VMVs). Specifically, polyarginine&#8208;tagged antigens were noncovalently assembled onto nucleic acid nanogels containing cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide via a salt&#8208;bridge zipper mechanism, which can activate Toll&#8208;like receptor 9. Upon intramuscular immunization, VMVs effectively drained into the LNs, recruiting and activating multiple innate cells, including CD8+ dendritic cells (DCs), CD103+ DCs, macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs, and neutrophils. This activation modulates the innate cell microenvironments and relocates antigen&#8208;presenting cells within LNs, optimizing adaptive immune responses. VMVs induced a robust antigen&#8208;specific immune response, characterized by high levels of neutralizing antibodies, augmented memory T cell activity, and enhanced development of germinal center B cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that dynamic modulation of innate cell microenvironments by VMVs leads to optimized generation of both humoral and cellular immunity against infectious diseases.

The study reveals that the photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (OWS) via a direct LCCT pathway surpassed that of an indirect LCCT pathway. The direct LCCT mechanism is pivotal in maximizing photon utilization efficiency and ensuring broad&#8208;spectrum OWS.

         <title>An Olefin Radical Based Thiele's Hydrocarbon Derivative and Macrocyclic Tetraradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent boron&#8208;containing derivative of Thiele's hydrocarbon and a macrocyclic tetraradical were synthesized under mild conditions. They both had an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and the macrocyclic tetraradical showed considerable tetraradical character and weak macrocyclic anti&#8208;aromaticity with an anticlockwise ring current. This method to construct a cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated tetraradical paves the way for future developments in cyclic polyradicals.








Abstract
A persistent Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative, containing two five&#8208;membered dioxoborocyclic monoradical units bridged by a p&#8208;phenylene moiety, was generated. It exhibits an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap. A macrocyclic molecule composed of two units of the Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative was also prepared. The macrocyclic molecule possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state but with considerable tetraradical character. The diradical and tetraradical compounds can be viewed as a zwitterionic species containing olefin radical cations. These newly formed compounds are stable in both the solid state and solution under an inert atmosphere for several days. They have been fully investigated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, and SQUID measurements, as well as theoretical calculations.

         <title>Spontaneous Anionic Double Capture/Displacement to Trigger Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Interpenetrating Polymer Networks with Desired Ionic Conductivity for Durable Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpenetrating polymer network interface is constructed to enable a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for the protection of the Zn anodes through an anionic double capture/displacement mechanism, and thereby inhibiting the corrosion of the Zn anode, preventing the side reaction, elevating the Zn ion transference number and stabilized the plating/striping of zinc ions.








Abstract
The engineering of single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) is a promising strategy to stabilize the anode/electrolyte interface in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. However, the commonly employed single&#8208;ion conductive solid or quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes often lead to a significant reduction in overall ionic conductivity, thereby impeding ion diffusion kinetics. Here, we propose a compromise strategy that effectively balances ionic conductivity and ion transference number. Specifically, a single&#8208;ion conductive interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with phase&#8208;functional decoupling is developed solely on the anode side, while a liquid electrolyte is retained on the cathode side. This design facilitates a high ion transference number (0.84) while maintaining the ionic conductivity at an optimal level (12.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1). The single&#8208;ion&#8208;conductive mechanism is unveiled as a spontaneous anionic dual capture/displacement process, which synergizes zincophilic&#8211;hydrophobic functionality to ensure efficient reversible Zn2+ stripping and plating. The modified electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability of 1300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled NH4V4O10//IPNs@Zn full cell exhibits an exceptional lifespan, enduring 9000 cycles with a remarkable retention of 80.8% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work introduces an effective approach for balancing ionic conductivity and ion transference numbers in SICs, offering a promising pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance SICs.

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#928;&#8208;Acceptor Self&#8208;Adaptive Conjugated Perylene Derivative with Low Solubility, High Capacity, and Swift Ion Transport Kinetics for High Performance Organic Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perylene derivative (DPL), encapsulated within a hollow nanocage terminated with radical PO polymer molecules bearing N&#9472;O radicals, has been conceptualized and designed to showcase high efficiency in potassium storage. This is attributed to the smart construction of helically twisted D&#8208;&#928;&#8208;A self&#8208;adaptive coordination conjugate (TSCC). This design yields exceptional fast&#8208;charging and long durable stability based on the small organic molecules.








Abstract
Organic perylene has been heralded as a promising candidate due to abundant structural diversity and tunability. However, its practical application is severely plagued by facile solubility, scarce redox&#8208;active sites, and andante kinetics behaviors. Herein, the perylene derivative (DPL), i.e., (1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy) perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride) conjugates with polyoxime ester (PO) and is further nested with N, P grafted hollow matrix with anchored Cu single atoms (Cu&#8208;NPC). Such Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO with helically twisted donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) conjugate bridged by Cu atoms was evaluated for K+ storage. Based on extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated structure, intensified interactions between PO and DPL, the minimal solubility of DPL is approached. Together with the core&#8208;shell solvation structure and compact cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) synergistically improves its long lifespan. The abundant stabled radical nitroxides, isocyano groups, and sp&#8208;C sites contribute greatly to the capacity elevation. The twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A self&#8208;adaptive coordination conjugate (TSCC) significantly elevates the distortion toward for the easier tendency to flipping and vibrating and thus expedited kinetics behaviors. Consequently, Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO reconciles the trade&#8208;off between fast&#8208;charging and long cycle stability involved 8&#8208;electron participation. This work exemplifies the importance of advanced design of the molecular scale engineering, including modulated redox&#8208;active sites and high stability toward for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;lifespan cell devices.

         <title>Unlocking the ConPeT Mechanism: Correspondence on &#8220;Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3&#160;+&#160;2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer&#8221;</title>

Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy highlights that the excited state of the radical anion of 4DPAPN, a TADF chromophore employed as a photocatalyst, is not directly involved in a ConPeT mechanism. Instead, its high reducing ability stems from the generation of solvated electrons through a two&#8208;photon process in acetonitrile solution.








Abstract
Recently, in a communication to this journal, Qiao, Jang, and coworkers described an asymmetric photoredox reaction promoted by TADF cyanoarene photocatalysts (specifically 4DPAPN (3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)phthalonitrile)). The authors claimed that the high reduction potential required for the reaction in acetonitrile was achieved by the radical anion of the photocatalyst in its excited state, which initiated the reaction. This mechanism is usually named consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPeT), in which two photons are involved: the first one to excite the photocatalyst and generate the radical anion 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; and the second photon to promote 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; to its excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211;. Employing ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, here we report that, although two photons are indeed involved in this transformation, the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; is short&#8208;lived, not emissive, and not quenched by the organic substrate employed in the reaction, opposite to what was claimed by the authors. The photocatalyst in the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; can generate a solvated electron that is able to reduce the substrate involved in this chemistry. It is worth noting that a different photochemical mechanism is likely to be operative in CH2Cl2, where solvated electrons are much less stabilized and reduction of the solvent might occur.

         <title>Precise Tuning of Functional Group Spatial Distribution on Porphyrin Rings for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atropisomers o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; and &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) with dual effects are ingeniously designed to efficiently modulate CO2RR selectivity, leveraging hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance to provide adsorption sites and protect intermediates. As a result, the sterically symmetric o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) interacts with carbonate, prevents C&#8211;C coupling, and exhibits excellent CH4 selectivity.








Abstract
Molecular catalysts play a critical role in regulating the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet the understanding of ligand function is largely restricted to modulating the electronic structure of the metal and reaction kinetics. Herein, a hydroxyl (&#9472;OH) ligand is introduced into a sterically hindered amino&#8208;porphyrin (o&#8208;TAPP) to synthesize the atropisomers porphyrin&#8208;salicylimine&#8208;Cu (o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa) with hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions (O&#9472;H&#8943;O), enabling efficient selection of CO and CH4 under dual effects. Detailed analysis shows that the &#9472;OH of o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) forms a noncovalent hydrogen bond with carbonate, characterized by a bond length of 2.01&#160;&#197; and an angle of 27.6&#176;, and this interaction reduces the reaction energy barrier, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84% for CH4. Moreover, the steric hindrance effect of the symmetric distribution of &#9472;OH facilitates protonation reactions by preventing C&#8211;C coupling. In contrast, &#9472;OH aggregated on o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;) forms a pocket&#8208;like hydrogen bond grid, which restricts free CO2 adsorption, and the rapid dissociation of *CO also interrupts the reaction. This work highlights the pivotal role of dual effects induced by ligand atropisomerization in regulating selectivity, offering new insights for the design of efficient molecular catalysts.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Ultraviolet Light&#8208;Activated Asymmetric Photopolymerization for the Synthesis of CPL&#8208;Active Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

This work develops a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL, &#955;em&#160;=&#160;360&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;0.188), achieved through thermodynamic regulation of the chiral supramolecular assembly. The asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257&#8208;based blend film can be realized by utilizing the CP&#8208;UVL as a chiral excitation source, resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072).








Abstract
Circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL) offers significant potential for practical applications in asymmetric photocatalysis and photopolymerization. However, the development of CP&#8208;UVL&#8208;active materials has been hindered by their low emission dissymmetry factors (gem). Here, we present a high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL material for asymmetric photopolymerization, achieved through thermodynamic regulation of a chiral supramolecular assembly. The chiral coassembled enantiomers, R/S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7, are synthesized using the naphthylamine derivative R/S&#8208;BNC as the chiral donor and OXD&#8208;7 as the achiral acceptor. Upon annealing at different temperatures, OXD&#8208;7 detaches from the chiral coassembly of S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7 and then self&#8208;assembles into ordered helical nanostructures, exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent CP&#8208;UVL (&#955;em = 360&#160;nm, with gem up to&#160;+0.188). Remarkably, the strong CP&#8208;UVL emission acts as a chiral excitation source, triggering the asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257 (which contains the achiral dye TPABBI and the photoinitiator Irg651), resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072). This study provides a simple yet effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL materials for CPL&#8208;induced asymmetric photopolymerization.

         <title>Thermal Activation of Asymmetry Amplification Effects in Helical Polymer&#8211;Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of helical polymer&#8208;metal complexes between chiral poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) and metal ions can trigger different asymmetry amplification effects, e.g. screw&#8208;sense enhancement, helix inversion, or the sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers effect. Adding a metal&#8208;scavenger resin (nonreversible) or lowering the temperature (reversible) can reverse the amplification, allowing the development of a metal ion or a temperature switch from a single chiral PPA.








Abstract
Dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) exhibit different asymmetry amplification effects, e.g., helix inversion or screw&#8208;sense induction, in the presence of different external stimuli such as temperature, solvents, or metal ions that usually operate independently through interaction with the pendant on the monomer repeating units (m.r.u.). In this work, we will demonstrate that the helical structure of a chiral PPA can be tamed by playing with two different external stimuli such as temperature and metal ions. Thus, when a metal ion salt is delivered to a chloroform solution of a chiral PPA to generate a chiral PPA (m.r.u.)/Mn+ complex in a ratio of 1.0/&lt;0.5&#160;mol/mol, a temperature&#8208;responsive material is obtained. Interestingly, when the temperature is lowered to about 278&#8211;283&#160;K, the metal ion uncomplexes, which recovers the initial helical structure adopted by the PPA. This complexation&#8211;decomplexation between the chiral PPA and the metal ions is fully reversible and triggers different asymmetry amplification effects&#8208;helix inversion, screw&#8208;sense induction or Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers (SaS), among others&#8212;, allowing the creation of a temperature&#8208;responsive helical polymer&#8211;metal complex (HPMC) from a metal&#8208;responsive helical polymer.

         <title>Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;Assisted Fe Oxidation imaged by Environmental Atom Probe. The oxidation of iron (Fe) at the tip of a sharp needle under high electrostatic fields has been visualized using an Environmental Atom Probe (EAP) and corroborated through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and a mean&#8208;field model applied to a multi&#8208;faceted catalytic grain, alongside statistical&#8208;mechanical analyses. EAP observations underscore the impact of surface structures, revealing that Fe oxidation predominantly occurs on exposed facets such as Fe{244} and Fe{112}, while facets with higher coordination numbers like Fe{024}, Fe{013}, and Fe{011} exhibit comparatively lower levels of oxidation. Intense electrostatic fields exert a significant influence on Fe oxidation by polarizing and attracting gas molecules toward the surface, thereby effectively raising the local pressure via enhanced electric field concentrations at the tip&#8216;s apex.







Abstract
We quantify the effects of intensely applied electric fields on the Fe oxidation mechanism. The specimen are pristine Fe single crystals exposing a variety of surface structures identified by field ion microscopy. These crystals are simultaneously exposed to low pressures of pure oxygen gas, on the order of 10&#8722;7&#8197;mbar, while applying intense electric fields on their surface of several tens of volts per nanometer. The local composition of the different surface structures is probed directly and in real time using an Environmental Atom Probe and successfully compared with first principles&#8208;based models. We found that rough Fe{244} and Fe{112} facets are more reactive toward oxygen than compact Fe{024} and Fe{011} facets. Results demonstrate that the influence of an electric field on the oxidation kinetics depends on the timescales that are involved as the system evolves toward equilibrium. The initial oxidation kinetics show that strong increases in electric fields facilitate the formation of an oxide. However, as one approaches equilibrium, high field values mitigate this formation. Ultimately, this study elucidates how high externally applied electric fields can be used to dynamically exploit reaction dynamics at the nanoscale towards desired products in a catalytic reaction at mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Chemical Bonds Containing Hydrogen: Choices for Hydrogen Carriers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen carriers utilizing B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, and O&#9472;H bonds are evaluated for their potential in hydrogen storage and release. Key candidates such as methanol, ammonia, and formic acid are examined with a focus on critical factors influencing performance, including the nature of chemical bonds, reaction pathways, and catalytic processes. Both fundamental and applied research efforts are crucial to advancing hydrogen carrier technologies for large&#8208;scale hydrogen deployment. 








Abstract
Compounds containing B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, or O&#9472;H bonds with high hydrogen content have been extensively studied as potential hydrogen carriers. Their hydrogen storage performance is largely determined by the nature of these bonds, decomposition pathways, and the properties of the dehydrogenation products. Among these compounds, methanol, cyclohexane, and ammonia stand out due to their low costs and established infrastructure, making them promising hydrogen carriers for large&#8208;scale storage and transport. They offer viable pathways for decarbonizing society by enabling hydrogen to serve as a clean energy source. However, several challenges persist, including the high temperatures required for (de)hydrogenation, slow kinetics, and the reliance on costly catalysts. To address these issues, strategies such as chemical modification and catalyst development are being pursued to improve hydrogen cycling performance. This review highlights recent progress in hydrogen carriers with B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, or O&#9472;H bonds. It examines the fundamental characteristics of these bonds and carriers, as well as advances in catalyst development. Our objective is to offer a comprehensive understanding of current state of hydrogen carriers and identify future research directions, such as molecular modification and system optimization. Innovations in these areas are crucial to advance hydrogen storage technologies for a large&#8208;scale hydrogen deployment.

         <title>A Sequential Release Micro&#8208;nano System for Colitis Therapy via Gut Microbiota and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The micro&#8208;nano system achieves the sequential release of drugs in response to gut microbiota and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inulin prebiotics restore gut microbiota balance. Selenium compounds scavenge ROS and promote macrophage polarization, while 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid suppresses TH17&#8208;cell differentiation. As a multifactorial therapeutic approach, inulin microspheres containing nanomicelles target the gut microbiome and immune responses for treating acute colitis.







Abstract
Commencing with the breakdown of the intestinal barrier, various pathogenic factors, such as dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, harmful inflammatory cytokines, and immune system imbalance, collectively contribute to the development of colitis. Numerous interventions focusing on single factors have been developed to provide short&#8208;term therapeutic benefits, but the continued existence of unresolved pathogenic factors can lead to disease exacerbation. Here we have designed a multicomponent system&#8208;inulin microspheres encapsulating selenium&#8208;containing nanomicelles, aiming to tackle the multiple factors associated with colitis. This micro&#8208;nano drug delivery platform achieves sequential release of drugs in the inflamed colon, with each component of the system functioning independently and jointly. The outer layer of inulin supplies nutrients for probiotics. The inner core comprises selenocystamine and 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid, which polarize macrophages towards an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype and regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting TH17&#8208;cell differentiation, respectively. In an acute colitis mouse model, this therapeutic system ameliorates colonic inflammation, enhances the abundance of gut microbiota, and modulates the mucosal immune system, showing potential in preventing colitis.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual circularity concept to prevent plastic waste accumulation is presented by Yue Han and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202421431). The concept is exemplified for triarylmethane&#8208;containing polyesters and their facile closed&#8208;loop recyclability via complementary mechanical and chemical routes. For the polymers with dual circularity, it is recommended to proceed with mechanical recycling when we can, and switch to chemical recycling when we must.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction to ammonia occurs with exceptional performance on ultrathin&#8208;sheet&#8208;assembled Fe80Ni20 nanoflowers, as described by Jason Lam et al. in their Research Article (e202500167). Mechanistic studies revealed that NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; preferentially adsorbs and is reduced to NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; on the Fe surface. Subsequently, NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; is efficiently hydrogenated to NH3 on the Ni surface. This in&#8208;tandem mechanism between Fe and Ni significantly enhances the electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; to NH3.

         <title>[C2N4H7O][NH2SO3]: High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Ditrigon Coupled Guanylurea Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on unit coupling strategy, a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) functional unit, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+), was proposed, and a novel KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like UV NLO crystal [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was designed and synthesized. This crystal achieves an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second harmonic generation response (6.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The Development of high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is critical in the field of optoelectronic functional crystals. High&#8208;performance NLO functional units are crucial for achieving desired target crystals. In this study, a promising group, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+, abbreviated as GU), was investigated using a unit coupling strategy. Furthermore, by modifying the KBe2BO3F2 template structure at the molecular level, the first metal&#8208;free guanylurea sulfamate [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was successfully synthesized. This crystal achieved an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.2&#215;KDP), and large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm). In addition, the remarkable phase&#8208;matching capability provides the potential for a fourth&#8208;harmonic generation (266&#8197;nm) in the Nd: YAG laser. Theoretical calculations indicated that GU and its favorable arrangement were primarily responsible for the large SHG effect and birefringence. Our study demonstrates that the GU group is promising for the development of UV NLO crystals.

Furthermore, by modifying the KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; template structure at the molecular level, the first metal-free guanylurea sulfamate [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O][NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] was successfully synthesized. This crystal achieved an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.2&#215;KDP), and large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm). In addition, the remarkable phase-matching capability provides the potential for a fourth-harmonic generation (266&#8197;nm) in the Nd: YAG laser. Theoretical calculations indicated that GU and its favorable arrangement were primarily responsible for the large SHG effect and birefringence. Our study demonstrates that the GU group is promising for the development of UV NLO crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Assembly of Single&#8208;Crystal 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based Organic Polymers via Dative B&#9472;N Bonds and Halogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pioneering instances of single&#8208;crystal 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers, namely BN&#8208;Cl and BN&#8208;Br, have been successfully synthesized through an innovative synergistic assembly approach that leverages halogen bonding and dative B&#8211;N interactions. Both BN&#8208;Cl and BN&#8208;Br crystals can attain sizes exceeding 1&#160;mm, making them ideal candidates for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis to elucidate their intricate structures. Remarkably, their single crystals exhibit exceptional photocatalytic performance in generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen, without the necessity of adding sacrificial agents.








Abstract
The rigorous synthetic methodologies have significantly impeded the progress in developing single&#8208;crystal extended organic polymers. Notably, the existence of macroscopic single&#8208;crystalline 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers has never been documented in the literature until now. In this study, we present a groundbreaking example of single&#8208;crystal 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers that are compatible with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD) for precise structural elucidation. Their formation is fundamentally dependent on the synergistic assembly facilitated by dative B&#9472;N bonds and halogen bonds. These crystals exhibit remarkable stability in both air and aqueous environments. Notably, the formation of the B&#8211;N Lewis pairs within these crystals significantly enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers, and their single crystals demonstrate exceptional photocatalytic activity for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen, without the requirement for sacrificial agents. This pioneering discovery establishes a new approach for crystalline control within the realm of organic polymers.

         <title>Modulating Binding Strength and Acidity of Benzene&#8208;Derivative Ligands Enables Efficient and Hysteresis&#8208;Free Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically explored the impact of binding strength and acidity of a library of molecules on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite surface to fabricate efficient and hysteresis&#8208;free perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Ultimately, (2&#8208;phenylethyl)phosphonic acid (PEPA) has the optimal passivation effect and enhances the charge extraction capability, achieving a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 32.13% (certified 31.72%) for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Passivating defects at the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite/C60 interface without impeding interfacial charge transport can effectively enhance the efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). Herein, we study the impact of benzene&#8208;derivative ligands with elaborately modulated binding strength and acidity on wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites for high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon TSCs. Specifically, the acidity/alkalinity and binding strength are preliminarily tuned using different functional groups of &#8208;PO&#8323;H&#8322;, &#8208;COOH, and &#8208;NH&#8322;, and further finely adjusted by altering the chain lengths between the benzene ring and the functional groups. The results show that strong binding is indispensable for effectively suppressing voltage loss. However, the commonly used benzylphosphonic acid (BPPA) for firm surface binding exhibits too strong acidity that can etch the perovskite surface, resulting in halide&#8208;vacancy defects and pronounced hysteresis. Increasing the side chain length of BPPA to (2&#8208;phenylethyl)phosphonic acid not only enables a suitable acid dissociation constant (pKa) to avoid acid&#8208;induced etching but also achieves robust anchoring to the perovskite surface with a parallel adsorption orientation, which reduces the charge transport barrier at the interface. These properties enable strong&#8208;adsorption surface termination (SAST) of the perovskite surface while preventing acid&#8208;induced etching. As a result, the SAST strategy achieves a remarkable efficiency of 32.13% (certified 31.72%) for hysteresis&#8208;free perovskite/silicon TSCs.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of S(IV)&#8208;Stereogenic Sulfinimidate Esters by Sulfinamide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S&#8208;chiral sulfinimidate esters by employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst is disclosed. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of a wide range of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines.








Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled approaches for the synthesis of S&#8208;stereogenic compounds have propelled significant advancements in asymmetric synthetic chemistry. In contrast, control over S&#8208;heteroatom (e.g., O) bond formation to access sulfinimidate esters remains an underexplored area. Drawing inspiration from recent progress in electrophilic amide activation, herein, we present a sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S&#8208;chiral sulfinimidate esters. This method involves the activation of racemic sulfinamides by sulfonyl chloride, yielding a reactive aza&#8208;sulfinyl mixed anhydride intermediate. Employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst, the process achieves excellent enantiocontrol in the subsequent formation of S&#9472;O bonds with alcohols involving a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, resulting in sulfinimidate esters with excellent enantioselectivity. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines, with promising applications in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>Constructing Stable and Wavelength&#8208;Extended Heptamethine Cyanines&#160;via Donor Ectopic Substitution for NIR&#8208;IIa/b Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic NIR&#8208;II dyes, particularly cyanine fluorophores, offer high molar extinction coefficients, biocompatibility and structural tunability and are popular for non&#8208;invasive, high&#8208;resolution and &#8208;contrast in vivo imaging. However, achieving stable, long&#8208;wavelength and large Stokes shift NIR&#8208;II cyanine suitable for NIR&#8208;IIa/IIb bioimaging is still a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength by the enhanced HOMO&#8208;LUMO separation through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR&#8208;II cyanine. Compared to the original NIR&#8208;II cyanine Flav7, these novel dyes (NIR&#8208;ACs) exhibited a significant emission redshift and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300 nm (NIR&#8208;IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500 nm (NIR&#8208;IIb). Notably, they also demonstrate excellent stability and deeper tissue imaging ability in vivo imaging. Finally, through surface modification of nanoparticles, NIR&#8208;ACs nanoparticles (NPs) have successfully achieved high&#8208;contrast tumor and bone&#8208;targeted detecting as well as multicolor imaging, providing robust tools for in&#8208;vivo diagnostics and biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiro&#160;Units Embedded in the B/N Center for Constructing Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This research departs from the conventional molecular design strategy that utilizes spiral units solely as side chains, terminal groups, or linkage units. Instead, we integrate the rigid 9,9'&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] (SF) unit fully or partially into the boron/nitrogen multiple resonances (B/N&#8208;MR) emitting core and successfully developed a range of new proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomerized MR thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, SF&#8208;BN1, SF&#8208;BN2, SF&#8208;BN3, and SF&#8208;BN4. Remarkably, these novel emitters exhibit exceptionally narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 15&#65374;21 nm in dilute toluene solutions and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 90% in doped films. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on SF&#8208;BN1 achieved high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 29.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.08), closely aligning with the BT.2020 blue emission standard. Sky&#8208;blue OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 can achieve a high EQE of 29.8%, with a narrow FWHM value of 18 nm; the hyperfluorescent (HF) OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 improved the EQE of 35.5%. Moreover, we elucidated subtle variations in the connectivity of chemical functional groups within emitters and the polar environment and doping concentrations of OLEDs, which can significantly impact these isomers' optical and electroluminescent (EL) properties.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This research departs from the conventional molecular design strategy that utilizes spiral units solely as side chains, terminal groups, or linkage units. Instead, we integrate the rigid 9,9'-spirobi[fluorene] (SF) unit fully or partially into the boron/nitrogen multiple resonances (B/N-MR) emitting core and successfully developed a range of new proof-of-concept isomerized MR thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters, SF-BN1, SF-BN2, SF-BN3, and SF-BN4.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions, specifically CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N contacts, between catalysts and substrates have recently gained renewed attention in asymmetric hydrogenations, despite their historical underappreciation due to challenges in detection. Emerging evidence underscores the significant role of these interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity, particularly in sustainable catalytic systems that utilize Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. This minireview summarizes advancements in asymmetric hydrogenations catalyzed by both noble and Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes under a H&#8322; atmosphere, with a focus on the roles of CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;O/N non&#8208;covalent interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity. Taking into account the weak attractive character of these non&#8208;covalent interactions, it is expected to help the design of novel chiral transition metal catalysts and develop more efficient asymmetric hydrogenation systems for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse chiral compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Transmembrane Alkane Monooxygenases to Improve a Key Reaction Step in the Synthesis of Polymer Precursor Tulipalin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone tulipalin A, a defense compound found in tulips, can polymerize via addition at the vinyl group or via ring&#8208;opening polymerization, making it a highly promising monomer for bio&#8208;based polymers. Since the biosynthesis of tulipalin&#160;A in plants remains elusive, we propose an alternative pathway for its synthesis starting from the terpenoid intermediate isoprenyl acetate. While fungal unspecific peroxygenases showed a preference for the unwanted epoxidation of its exo&#8208;olefin group, bacterial alkane monooxygenases were selective for terminal hydroxylation. By combining protein engineering based on de novo structure prediction of the membrane enzymes with cell engineering, the specific activity was increased 6&#8208;fold to 1.83&#160;U&#160;gcdw&#8208;1. Oxidation of the formed allylic alcohol by a three&#8208;enzyme cascade and subsequent lactonization yielded tulipalin A. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing the polymer precursor tulipalin&#160;A from terpenoid intermediates and provide a solid foundation for future metabolic engineering endeavors.</dc:description>

         <title>Environmental History is Transferred via Minerals Altering Formose Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is generally accepted that minerals were an important source of prebiotic catalysis. In this work we demonstrate how the prebiotic sugar forming formose reaction is guided to unique reaction compositions in the presence of a variety of minerals. When the same mineral is transferred between multiple sequential batch reactions, a new reaction composition is obtained after each reaction cycle. We attribute this effect to the adsorption of catalytic Ca(OH)2 to mineral surfaces. Further exploration shows that first exposing the mineral surface to the aqueous catalyst allows the mineral to subsequently produce formose outputs without the need for any additional catalyst to be present. The impact of the minerals on the formose reaction is dependent on the previous environment. As such, the mineral surface functions as storage of the preceding environmental conditions. Our work supports the development of chemical complexity through the transfer of information between sequences of chemical environments.</dc:description>

         <title>All Iron&#8208;Group and Platinum&#8208;Group Elements Metal High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEA) are promising catalyst materials for important energy transformations. So far, the focus has been on platinum&#8208;group metals which possess excellent catalytic performance and similar properties, thus being easy to synthesize. However, incorporating more abundant and cheaper elements is preferable for large&#8208;scale applications and is fundamentally more interesting as elements with different properties are expected to greatly affect the structural and electronic characteristics of the resulting alloy. Unfortunately, significant differences in elemental properties greatly complicate the synthesis and require extreme reaction conditions. In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles containing the nine neighboring elements used most often in heterogeneous catalysis: all the iron&#8208;group metals (Fe, Co and Ni) and all the platinum&#8208;group metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) through a simple low temperature solution process. Remarkably, alloying the iron&#8208;group base metals with the platinum&#8208;group metals results in 50% increase in the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions (TOF@25mV=1.58 s&#8208;1) compared to the equivalent alloy containing only platinum&#8208;group metals conditions (TOF@25mV=1.2 s&#8208;1). This activity is three times that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (TOF@25mV=0.58 s&#8208;1) demonstrating simultaneous reduction in precious metal content and performance enhancement of electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enabled, Light&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Amino Acid Derivatives and Short Peptides using O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative oxygenation of amino acid derivatives and short peptides using dioxygen as a green oxidant. A reverse catalytic strategy utilizing Lewis basic diphenyl diselenide as a Lewis acid catalyst to activate carboxylic acid via chalcogen bonding interaction&#160;is the key to this work. This synthetic method is tolerant of functionalities present in both natural and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, enabling the efficient synthesis of C&#8208;terminal amides or imides. Mechanistic studies suggest there is a dual noncovalent interaction between diphenyl diselenide and carboxylic acid, which allows radical decarboxylation through photoinduced intermolecular electron transfer. This new activation mode of carboxylic acids will add a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Intermediates Formation on Atomically Pd&#8208;Bridged Cu/Cu2O Interfaces for Kinetics&#8208;Matching Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical C&#8208;N coupling of CO2 and nitrogenous species provides a promising approach for synthesizing valuable chemicals such as urea, amides, and other C&#8208;N compounds. However, the unbalanced formation of C&#8208; and N&#8208;intermediates results in slow C&#8208;N coupling kinetics. Herein, we report an atomically Pd&#8208;bridged Cu/Cu2O (Pd1&#8208;Cu/Cu2O) catalyst, synthesized through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Pd1&#8208;Cu2Te nanosheets. This catalyst features Pd&#8208;Cu dual sites that significantly enhance C&#8208;N coupling both thermodynamically and kinetically. The reconstructed Pd1&#8208;Cu/Cu2O achieves a urea yield rate of 31.8 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 42.2%, along with excellent stability over 100 h. In situ spectroscopic examinations and theoretical calculations disclose that the Pd&#8208;Cu dual sites on Pd1&#8208;Cu/Cu2O modulate the reduction kinetics of CO2 and NO3&#8208;, balance the formation of crucial *CO and *NH2 intermediates, and lower the energy barrier for C&#8208;N coupling, thereby facilitating urea synthesis. Furthermore, the Pd1&#8208;Cu/Cu2O enables the unprecedented C&#8208;N coupling of aniline with CO, resulting in a remarkable acetanilide yield rate of 1021.2 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1 with an FE of 23.7%. This heteroatom bridging strategy offers a new pathway for designing efficient electrocatalyst for the synthesis of C&#8208;N coupled compounds.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the Pd1-Cu/Cu2O enables the unprecedented C-N coupling of aniline with CO, resulting in a remarkable acetanilide yield rate of 1021.2 mmol h-1 gcat.-1 with an FE of 23.7%. This heteroatom bridging strategy offers a new pathway for designing efficient electrocatalyst for the synthesis of C-N coupled compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Develop Complex Photocatalytic System of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type Conjugated Porous Polymers and Benzyl Alcohol Mediated Autocatalysis for Practical Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 is conceived to be an ideal approach for replacing the industrial anthraquinone method that suffers from hefty energy penalties and environmental toxicity. However, the low concentration of H2O2 resides as the biggest hurdle for industrial production. Herein, with a focus on fabricating high&#8208;performance heterogeneous photocatalysts and establishing a highly efficient complex photocatalytic system, we report the preparation of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type conjugated porous polymers containing a photosensitizer and redox&#8208;active anthraquinone moiety for endowing highly efficient H2O2 production up to 3.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Further, by exploiting the autocatalytic photooxidation feature of benzyl alcohol, &#8226;OOH as the key species contributing to H2O2 formation received a substantial accumulation, which stems from the collaboration of the photocatalytic and autocatalytic cycle. Mechanistically, the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between the photocatalyst and benzyl alcohol are formed to lower the free energy of the transition states, thus leading to unprecedently high efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2 up to 140.4 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, with the concentration of 35.1 mmol L&#8208;1 and apparent quantum yield of 49%. This work provides critical insights in advancing sustainable energy conversion research.</dc:description>

         <title>Macromolecule&#8208;Enriched Solvation Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a viable alternative for sustainable and cost&#8208;effective energy storage, yet their energy density is curtailed by relatively low voltage outputs (&lt; 4 V) due to the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes. Here, for the first time, we describe a high&#8208;voltage Na+ electrolyte featuring a macromolecule&#8208;enriched solvation architecture. The vulnerable small molecules in the Na+ solvation shell are replaced by macro polyamide (PA) molecules with high thermodynamic resilience, ensuring a wide electrochemical stability window for the electrolytes with suppressed oxidative/reductive decomposition. Concomitantly, the anions engage in H&#8208;bonding with the amido groups of PA, which not only stabilizes the anions against hydrolysis, but also delivers a high Na+ transference number of 0.93. Importantly, the nitrogen&#8208;rich composition of the macromolecule&#8208;enriched electrolyte (MEE) fosters the formation of robust nitride interphases that impart  enduring stability to both the cathode and anode. As a result, the hard carbon (HC) || NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) full cells demonstrate significant rechargeability even with an ultrahigh cutoff voltage of 4.4 V. Our approach distinctively avoids the use of fluorinated molecules typically found in (localized&#8208;) high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, presenting a novel principle that could revolutionize high&#8208;voltage electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework as a Li&#8208;ion Guided Channel Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Anode in Carbonate&#8208;based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal exhibits great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical application of Li metal anodes is severely hindered by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites as well as the instability of the spontaneously generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), causing safety concerns and lifespan issues. Herein, we customize a novel urea&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;531) as an interfacial Li&#8208;ion pump. The COF&#8208;531 is constructed utilizing a highly dynamic urea&#8208;linkage, which balances the low reactivity of N&#8208;rich melamine (MA), and could simultaneously provide abundant lithiophilic N sites and crystallinity ordered ion channels. This structure is able to promote efficient Li+ de&#8208;solvation and transport, leading to uniform deposition via inhibiting dendrites growth. As a result, the COF@Li anode exhibits remarkable cycling performance under high current density (10 mA cm&#8208;2 over 11500 h and 20 mA cm&#8208;2 over 6000 h in the symmetric Li cells, and 1013 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles under 8.4 A g&#8208;1 in a COF@Li || S&#8208;in&#8208;CMK&#8208;3 cell), setting a new benchmark for long&#8208;cycle performance in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. Remarkably, the COF&#8208;531 can be produced at a low&#8208;cost (~58.6 USD kg&#8208;1) on a kilogram scale. This work&#160;addresses a critical bottleneck in the commercialization of Li&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Euphane Triterpenoids Using Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Euphane triterpenoids are widely distributed in nature and show various intriguing bioactivities, but relatively few synthetic routes to them have been described. Here we report asymmetric convergent total syntheses of euphanes involving two triterpenoids and two nortriterpenoids: euphol, 25,26,27&#8208;trisnor&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;euphan&#8208;24&#8208;al, euphorbiumrin D and oxo&#8208;tirucall&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The syntheses employ an enantioselective Antilla allylboration and intramolecular radical cyclization to construct ring A, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Liebeskind stannane&#8208;thioester coupling to connect ring A with the bicyclic CD system, and a novel radical cascade with metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) to complete the polycyclic architecture. The late&#8208;stage syntheses of both triterpenoids feature a diimide reduction and a MHAT/1,5&#8208;hydrogen transfer cascade to diastereoselectively forge the C20 and C17 stereogenic centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;Chain Copolymer Network via In Situ Polymerization Enables High&#8208;Stability and Lead&#8208;Safe Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made significant progress due to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the long&#8208;term stability and lead toxicity of PSCs remain a huge challenge for further commercialization. Herein, we designed a multifunctional additive PAE with photosensitive properties to overcome these difficulties. A unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network can be constructed via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The multiple active sites in the polymer chains can passivate various defects and enhance charge transfer. Meanwhile, the vast network provides an effective defense for perovskite to stabilize the internal structure and resist harsh external environments, thus delaying the degradation of devices and maximizing the suppression of toxic lead leakage. Remarkably, the devices protected by the network achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%), the unencapsulated devices suppressed 80% of lead leakage and the encapsulated devices maintained 93% of the initial PCE after 1000 h in a humid and thermal environment (65 &#176;C and 85% RH).</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling CO&#8208;Tolerance Mechanism in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells via Operando Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO poisoning remains a critical challenge for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Current studies of CO tolerance primarily focus on solid/liquid interfaces (in&#8208;situ conditions), which differ significantly from PEMFCs' solid/liquid/gas triple&#8208;phase interfaces (operando conditions) in microenvironment and mass transport. Herein, we developed an operando transmission infrared spectroscopy method that enables direct observation of CO tolerance mechanism on commercial PtRu/C catalysts in PEMFCs. Under in&#8208;situ conditions, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity is governed by CO mass transfer, and is insensitive to the availability of active sites, while it is highly sensitive under operando conditions due to enhanced mass transfer, thereby aggravating CO poisoning effects. Notably, 76% of HOR activity can recover upon switching to pure H2. Based on CO band evolution, we proposed a new pathway beyond the traditional bifunctional mechanism of CO tolerance: CO migrates from Pt to Ru sites, undergoing oxidation at potentials as low as 0.01 V vs.&#160;reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).</dc:description>

Herein, we developed an operando transmission infrared spectroscopy method that enables direct observation of CO tolerance mechanism on commercial PtRu/C catalysts in PEMFCs. Under in-situ conditions, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity is governed by CO mass transfer, and is insensitive to the availability of active sites, while it is highly sensitive under operando conditions due to enhanced mass transfer, thereby aggravating CO poisoning effects. Notably, 76% of HOR activity can recover upon switching to pure H2. Based on CO band evolution, we proposed a new pathway beyond the traditional bifunctional mechanism of CO tolerance: CO migrates from Pt to Ru sites, undergoing oxidation at potentials as low as 0.01 V vs.&#160;reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proximal and Remote Hydrocarboxylation of Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide Enabled by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of carbon dioxide and alkenes as feedstocks for the synthesis of carboxylic acids holds great significance in the realm of sustainable chemistry. Nonetheless, achieving selective C&#8722;H bond carboxylation of alkenes with broad applicability has long been a challenging task. Herein, we present a straightforward and unifying approach for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;carboxylic acids through nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical hydrocarboxylation of both functionalized and unactivated, simple alkenes, at proximal and remote sites. Notably, this operationally simple catalytic reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, having excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities, and is suitable for late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigations showed that a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (Ni&#8208;HAT) pathway is in operation, accounting for the site&#8208;selective hydrocarboxylation protocol for various alkene substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemically Tailored Peptide Binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 to Enable Versatile Design of Membrane Protein&#8208;Targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically tailored peptide binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 developed by a structure&#8208;guided design strategy are used to establish a novel E3 ligase&#8208;mediated modular platform for membrane protein degradation. This innovative system enables robust generation of synthetic bispecific chimeras featuring enhanced structural diversity and smaller size. The platform demonstrates broad applicability in degrading diverse membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets, including programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).








Abstract
Targeted membrane protein degradation using cell surface E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 via proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represents an effective strategy for treating membrane drug targets that cannot be fully inhibited using traditional inhibitors. Several ingenious chimeras have been developed to tether RNF43/ZNRF3 to target membrane proteins, resulting in the degradation of targets at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. However, currently available RNF43/ZNRF3 binders are genetically encoded and have poor plasticity, which limits the design and promotion of such PROTACs. Here, we exploited the AlphaFold&#8208;predicted complex structures of ligand&#8208;bound RNF43/ZNRF3 and developed a class of chemically tailored peptide binders for ZNRF3/RNF43. With these peptide binders that can be conveniently prepared by de novo peptide synthesis, we established a new membrane protein degradation platform that allows versatile modular design and targeted degradation of clinically relevant membrane proteins, i.e., PD&#8208;L1 and EGFR. This study presents a new subtype within the PROTAC field to develop therapeutic peptides targeting membrane proteins.

         <title>Amphipathic Antimicrobial Peptides Illuminate a Reciprocal Relationship Between Self&#8208;assembly and Cytolytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between self&#8208;assembly and membrane lytic activity for a class of antimicrobial peptides derived from amphipathic helices. Peptide modifications that stabilized the assembly abrogated membrane activity, while modifications that promoted dynamic behavior induced lytic activity. CryoEM was employed to determine the structure of the AMP assembly, which revealed a unique helical bilayer nanotube. 








Abstract
Amphipathic character, encoded within the polar sequence patterns of antimicrobial peptides, is a critical structural feature that influences membrane disruptive behavior. Similarly, polar sequence patterns induce self&#8208;assembly of amphipathic peptides, which results in the formation of ordered supramolecular structures. The relationship between self&#8208;assembly and membrane activity remains an open question of relevance for the development of effective antimicrobial peptides. Here, we report the structural investigation of a class of lytic peptides that self&#8208;assemble into filamentous nanomaterials. CryoEM analysis was employed to determine the structure of one of the filaments, which revealed that the peptides are self&#8208;assembled into a bilayer nanotube, in which the interaction between layers of amphipathic &#945;&#8208;helices was mediated through hydrophobic interactions. The relative stability of the filament peptide assemblies depended on the influence of sequence modifications on the helical conformation. Antimicrobial assays indicated that cytolytic activity was associated with dynamic disassociation of the filamentous assemblies under the assay conditions. Structural modifications of the peptides that stabilized the filaments abrogated lytic activity. These results illuminate a reciprocal relationship between self&#8208;assembly and antimicrobial activity in this class of amphipathic peptides and that reversible assembly was critical for the observation of biological activity.

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Halogen&#8208;Doped PbSnS2 with Optimized Thermoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PbSnS2 single crystal was grown using the Bridgman method, and its crystal structure was refined to determine with Pb and Sn atoms occupying a crystallographic site. Subsequently, halogen elements are used as dopants, which enhances the power factor and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity due to the increase in electron concentration and the weakening of the Pb/Sn&#9472;S bond.








Abstract
Here, we investigate PbSnS2, a wide band gap (1.13&#160;eV) compound, as a promising thermoelectric material for power generation. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals its 2D&#8208;layered structure, akin to the GeSe structure type, with Pb and Sn atoms sharing the same crystallographic site. The polycrystalline PbSnS2 exhibits an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.37&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 573&#160;K. However, the low carrier concentration (n) leads to suboptimal electrical conductivity (&#963;), capping the ZT value at 0.1. Accordingly, the halogen elements (Cl, Br, and I) are employed as the n&#8208;type dopants to improve the n. The DFT results indicate a significant weakening of Pb/Sn&#9472;S bonds upon halogen&#8208;doping, contributing to the observed reduction in &#954;lat. Our analysis indicates the activation of multiconduction band transport driven by halogen substitution. The PbSnS1.96Br0.04 has a high power factor of five times that of intrinsic PbSnS2. Halogen&#8208;doping weakens the Pb/Sn&#9472;S bonds and enhances the phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow &#954;lat of 0.29&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 873&#160;K for PbSnS1.96Br0.04. Consequently, PbSnS1.96Br0.04 achieved a maximum ZT value of 0.82 at 873 K.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Gold Clusters Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Driven Intercluster Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric pairs of clusters, R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red, were assembled by intercluster hydrogen bonds. Both solid clusters exhibit reversible CPL transformations in response to organic vapors, temperature, or mechanical stimuli, attributed to the disruption and reformation of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Their capacity for reversible switching in CPL renders these clusters promising for information encryption applications.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) metal clusters hold significant potential in high&#8208;security encryption and sensing applications, yet the exploration of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven CPL&#8208;active metal clusters remains limited. Here, we report the synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of rhomboid Au4 clusters utilizing chiral R/S&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyloxazole&#8208;2&#8208;thione (R/S&#8208;HMMT) ligands. Two enantiomeric pairs of self&#8208;assembled metal clusters R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red were obtained, by constructing distinct intercluster hydrogen bonds through the use of different crystalline solvents. In R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue, 1,4&#8208;dioxane guest molecules were observed to form a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with the hydroxyl groups of the cluster surface ligands. In contrast, a different hydrogen&#8208;bond network involving the hydroxyl groups of the surface ligands was identified in R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red, resulting in a distinct stacking pattern. The unique intercluster couplings mediated by hydrogen bonds result in R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue exhibiting a blue CPL emission at 466&#160;nm, while R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red shows a dual CPL emission at 446 and 727&#160;nm. Theoretical calculations reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond driven intercluster couplings in R&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red are significantly stronger than in R&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue. Additionally, both solid R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red undergo reversible CPL transformations in response to organic vapors, temperature, or mechanical stimuli, due to the destruction and reconstruction of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. These characteristics make them promising materials for information encryption applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) metal clusters hold significant potential in high-security encryption and sensing applications, yet the exploration of hydrogen-bond-driven CPL-active metal clusters remains limited. Here, we report the synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of rhomboid Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; clusters utilizing chiral &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-4-hydroxymethyl-5-methyloxazole-2-thione (&lt;b&gt;

   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-red&lt;/b&gt; were obtained, by constructing distinct intercluster hydrogen bonds through the use of different crystalline solvents. In &lt;b&gt;

In contrast, a different hydrogen-bond network involving the hydroxyl groups of the surface ligands was identified in &lt;b&gt;

The click chemist's playground: The most important certainty&#8208;of&#8208;chance outcome of click chemistry was the realization that perfect reactions can exist. Chemistry is about bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking reactions between atoms and molecules. So, the emergence of &#8220;perfect reaction&#8221; status promises to be transformative to the very heart of chemistry, and thence to the range of benefits for mankind that its future evolution may hold.

         <title>Trifunctionalization of Iodoarenes via Sequence&#8208;Controlled Double Ortho C&#8208;H Acylations by Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a novel palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization reaction of ortho&#8208;unsubstituted iodoarenes by incorporating two distinct acyl groups at their ortho C&#8208;H positions and replacing the ipso&#8208;iodide with an alkenyl or aryl group. Notably, this transformation was enabled by the alkyl/aryl mixed anhydrides, which were utilized as dual acylation reagents by abstracting their central oxygen atom with electrophilic 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the alkyl&#8208;acyl unit of such an anhydride was employed for the first C&#8208;H alkyl&#8208;acylation, and in situ released aryl carboxylate anion was then rapidly activated with triazine chloride to provide an aryl&#8208;acyl electrophile for the second C&#8208;H acylation, thus enabling the trifunctionalization of iodoarenes by termination with an intermolecular Heck or intramolecular arylation reaction. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the selective manipulation of carbonyl groups of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Near Infrared/Shortwave Infrared Emissive Chromophores: Synthesis of Triphenylamine&#8208;Appended Pyrazinacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active triphenylamine&#8208;appended pyrazinacenes show extreme reversible redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties. In their reduced state, absorption and emission bands fall well within the visible region. Oxidation results in a shift in the absorption and fluorescence bands to the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions while maintaining high fluorescence quantum yields.








Abstract
Organic dyes showing absorbance and fluorescence in the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions are attractive for a variety of applications. Redox&#8208;coupled reversible switching of absorbance or fluorescence implies enhanced functionality of such dyes, especially where large changes in photophysical properties across the redox process can be realized. Here, the synthesis of two new pyrazinacenes containing four and five fused pyrazine units, appended with electron&#8208;donor triphenylamine groups, and redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties is reported. In their reduced state, the compounds show absorbance and fluorescence in the visible region. Reversible shifts in absorbance and fluorescence from the visible to the near infrared or even short&#8208;wave infrared regions are observed upon chemical and electrochemical oxidations. Such large redox&#8208;coupled shifts in photophysical properties are unprecedented for a redox process that affects only a single, six&#8208;membered ring in which both reduced and oxidized states consist of neutral, closed&#8208;shell species. The compounds show high fluorescence quantum yields in their reduced states, and oxidized species show fluorescence quantum yields that compare well with existing near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared active fluorescent dyes.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Upgrading of Biomass and CO2 Utilization Using Fe/Ni&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotubes Derived from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, fossil fuel consumption has led to petroleum shortages and high carbon emissions. Thus, this study explores renewable resources for the electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and carbon monoxide (CO), from hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and carbon dioxide (CO2), respectively, using Fe/Ni&#8208;supported carbon nanotubes (CNTs) catalysts derived from CO2, achieving a faradaic efficiency of FDCA as 99.60% and 96.25% for CO.








Abstract
Fossil fuel consumption has caused petroleum shortages and increased carbon emissions; thus, utilizing renewable resources in biorefineries for biomass&#8208;derived chemical synthesis is promising. Among them, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a key alternative to terephthalic acid (PTA) for sustainable polyester production. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient approach for the simultaneous production of FDCA while utilizing carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) via an electrochemical approach. Complete electrooxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) at the anode yields FDCA, while CO&#8322; reduction at the cathode produces valuable compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO). This concurrent HMF electrooxidation and CO&#8322; electroreduction strategy enables high&#8208;value chemical production at mild conditions. In addition, we developed efficient single catalysts, FeNi metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes deposited on nickel foam (FeNiCNTs/NF) as both the anode and the cathode for HMF oxidation and CO2 reduction, respectively. Remarkably, faradaic efficiencies reached 99.60% for FDCA (FEFDCA) at the anode and 96.25% for CO (FECO) at the cathode. This study highlights the effective use of synthesized non&#8208;noble metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived CNTs for integrated biorefinery and CO&#8322; utilization.

         <title>Suppressing Spontaneous Acidic Corrosion and Hydrogen Evolution for Stable Zn//MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde (M4) into the electrolyte is proposed to mitigate acidic corrosion and hydrogen evolution by regulating the Zn2+ solvation structure. This strategy suppresses side reactions, enhances the reversibility of Zn anode, and extends the lifespan of Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn//MnO2 batteries have attracted significant attention due to their high safety and cost&#8208;effective for potential large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the severe acidic corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Zn anodes in acidic electrolytes pose critical challenges to their practical application. Here, we introduce trace amounts of p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde (M4) into the electrolyte to address the above anode issues. Leveraging its strong affinity for Zn2+ and H2O, M4 molecules reconstruct the Zn(H2O)62+ solvation sheath and adsorb onto the anode surface, effectively blocking direct contact between H+ and Zn. This dual action significantly mitigates acidic corrosion and HER, enhancing Zn anode reversibility and stability. Benefiting from these merits, symmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability of over 2000 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2, delivering a fivefold increase in lifespan compared to conventional electrolytic cells. Moreover, Zn//MnO2 batteries demonstrate stable operation for more than 3000 cycles in acidic electrolyte with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 97.3%. The assembled pouch cell delivers a high capacity of 1.68&#160;Ah, maintaining stable operation for over 100 cycles. This work presents unique perspectives and offers promising avenues to improve the stability and efficiency of aqueous battery systems.

         <title>Boosting Nonradiative Decay of Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dendrimers for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed a dendrimer engineering strategy to develop the boron difluoride formazanate (BDF) dye BDF&#8208;8OMe for photoacoustic imaging&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. The multiple identical dendritic units of BDF&#8208;8OMe significantly enhanced the molecular motions, enabling the nanoparticles to release 94.4% of the excited state energy rapidly through nonradiative decay at a rate of 11.7&#160;ps. Under 1064&#160;nm photoirradiation, BDF&#8208;8OMe NPs achieved a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.5%, facilitating NIR&#8208;II photothermal theranostics.








Abstract
The development of small molecular dyes excitable in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) is crucial for deep&#8208;tissue penetration and maximum permissible exposure in cancer photothermal theranostics. Herein, we employed a dendrimer engineering strategy to develop the boron difluoride formazanate (BDF) dye BDF&#8208;8OMe for photoacoustic imaging&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. BDF&#8208;8OMe, characterized by an increased molecular branching degree and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, exhibited broad absorbance peaked at 905&#160;nm, with the absorption tail extending to 1300&#160;nm. Additionally, reorganization energy calculation, molecular dynamics simulation, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the multiple identical dendritic units of BDF&#8208;8OMe significantly enhanced the molecular motions, enabling the nanoparticles (NPs) to rapidly release 94.4% of the excited state energy through nonradiative decay at a rate of 11.7&#160;ps. Under 1064&#160;nm photoirradiation, BDF&#8208;8OMe NPs achieved a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.5%, facilitating NIR&#8208;II photothermal theranostics. This work highlights the potential of the dendrimer&#8208;building strategy in developing NIR&#8208;II excitable small molecular dyes for efficient photothermal theranostics.

         <title>Electrophotocatalysis for Reductive Defluorination of PTFE and PFASs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercapacitor&#8208;electrophotocatalysis system combining electrical and photochemical energy to achieve efficient defluorination of PTFE at low temperatures is developed. The utilization of sunlight as the light source and supercapacitor as the electrical energy source makes the reaction portable and enables its outdoor applications.








Abstract
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is among the most inert poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and its degradation under mild conditions remains underdeveloped. We report a supercapacitor&#8208;assisted electrophotocatalysis, incorporating the strength of both electrochemical and photochemical energy, for the efficient defluorination of PTFE and other PFASs at low temperatures. CBZ6 worked as a photoreductant for injecting electrons into the inert carbon&#8211;fluorine bond, whereas the supercapacitor enabled the generation of the catalytically active species via an electrophotochemical process. Furthermore, the utilization of sunlight as the light source and supercapacitor as the electrical energy source makes the reaction portable and enables its outdoor applications.

         <title>Photocatalytic Stereochemical Editing for the Concise Syntheses of (25S)&#8208;&#916;7&#8208;Dafachronic Acid, Demissidine, and Smilagenin</title>

         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed stereochemical editing of tertiary C&#9472;H bonds of steroids enabled concise syntheses of (25S)&#8208;&#916;7&#8208;dafachronic acid, demissidine, and smilagenin. Acetate protection of the hydroxyl group in the synthesis of (25S)&#8208;&#916;7&#8208;dafachronic acid, protonation of the amino group in the synthesis of demissidine, and steric hindrance control in the synthesis of smilagenin provided robust solutions to the issue of the regioselectivity associated with hydrogen atom abstraction.








Abstract
Stereochemistry editing serves as an important tool to precisely adjust the desired stereochemical configuration of a molecule. In this study, enabled by photocatalytic stereochemical editing of tertiary C&#9472;H bonds of steroids, we have completed concise syntheses of (25S)&#8208;&#916;7&#8208;dafachronic acid, demissidine, and smilagenin. The feasibility of regioselectively editing tertiary stereocenters with either very weak &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl C&#9472;H bonds (in the synthesis of dafachronic acid), &#945;&#8208;amino C&#9472;H bonds (in the synthesis of demissidine), or with varying steric hindrance (in the synthesis of smilagenin) has been successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Thermally Conductive Naphthalene Epoxy Resin by Tailoring Flexible Chain Length and Liquid Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene&#8208;based liquid crystal epoxy monomers (LCEs) with low liquid crystal temperature ranges (67&#8211;78&#160;&#176;C) were synthesized by modifying the flexible chain length on both sides of naphthalene. The LCEs were cured within liquid crystal temperature to form naphthalene liquid crystal epoxy resin (LCER) with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.40&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is about 2.2 times higher than that of E&#8208;51.








Abstract
Epoxy resins with high thermal conductivity (&#955;) are widely used in electronic packaging, bonding, and coating. However, those with high intrinsic &#955;, typically synthesized using biphenyl or aromatic rings extended by ester linkages as the mesogenic unit, often exhibit high liquid crystal transition temperatures and poor processability. In this study, a series of naphthalene&#8208;based liquid crystal epoxy monomers (LCEs) were synthesized, using naphthalene as the mesogenic unit and modifying the flexible chain length on both sides. The resulting LCEs were cured within its liquid crystal phase to form naphthalene liquid crystal epoxy resin (LCER). The results show that the network order, radius of gyration, and low&#8208;frequency vibrational density of states all initially increase and then decrease with increasing flexible chain length. For LCER2, with a three&#8208;carbon flexible chain, these parameters reach their maximum values, facilitating phonon diffusion and enhancing &#955;. The liquid crystal transition temperature, &#955;, heat resistance index, and storage modulus of LCER2 were 67&#8211;78&#160;&#176;C, 0.40&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 158.8&#160;&#176;C, and 2059&#160;MPa, respectively, approximately 2.2 times higher than that of E&#8208;51 resin (0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). This work offers insights into designing epoxy resins with low liquid crystal transition temperature, high intrinsic &#955;, and excellent mechanical properties for thermal management.

The liquid crystal transition temperature, &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;, heat resistance index, and storage modulus of LCER&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were 67&#8211;78&#160;&#176;C, 0.40&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 158.8&#160;&#176;C, and 2059&#160;MPa, respectively, approximately 2.2 times higher than that of E-51 resin (0.18&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work offers insights into designing epoxy resins with low liquid crystal transition temperature, high intrinsic &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;, and excellent mechanical properties for thermal management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Mechanistic Control of Nonadiabatic Tunnelling in Triplet Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instanton theory is applied to study the reactivity of triplet carbenes at low temperature. We find a competition between a sequential mechanism of intersystem crossing (ISC) followed by hydrogen tunnelling and a new concerted nonadiabatic tunnelling pathway. This explains the differences in the observed reactivity of three chemically similar carbenes.








Abstract
Experiments on three chemically similar triplet carbenes observed the reaction of one at 10 K, another only when heated to 65 K, whereas the third remained stable despite heating. As the products are singlets, it is clear that the reactions involve intersystem crossing in addition to intramolecular hydrogen transfer. Here, instanton theory is used to study various possible reaction mechanisms, including sequential and concerted pathways. The latter describes a new reaction mechanism which involves changing spin state (a nonadiabatic process) while heavy atoms tunnel underneath a barrier (an adiabatic process). In each case, we find that the concerted pathway dominates the rate at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures it switches to a sequential mechanism. The existence of a crossover temperature is the key to explaining the experimental observations and demonstrates that temperature can control the reactivity of triplet carbenes via nonadiabatic&#160;tunnelling.

         <title>Breaking Linear Scaling Relation Limitations on a Dual&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Atom Copper&#8208;Tungsten Oxide Catalyst for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;bearing WO3 catalyst (Cu1/WO3) was developed to break linear scaling relation limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts for NH3&#8208;N synthesis using NO3&#8722; pollutants as feedstocks. Specifically, WO3 dissociated water molecules and supplied Cu1 with ample protons, whereas the Cu1 in an electron&#8208;deficient state converted NO3&#8722;&#8208;N to NH3&#8208;N efficiently.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;, NO3RR) on single&#8208;atom copper catalysts (Cu&#8208;SACs) offers a sustainable approach to ammonia (NH3) synthesis using NO3&#8722; pollutants as feedstocks. Nevertheless, this process suffers from inferior NO3RR kinetics and nitrite accumulation owing to the linear scaling relation limitations for SACs. To break these limitations, a single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;bearing tungsten oxide catalyst (Cu1/WO3) was developed, which mediated a unique dual&#8208;driven NO3RR process. Specifically, WO3 dissociated water molecules and supplied the Cu1 site with ample protons, whereas the Cu1 site in an electron&#8208;deficient state converted NO3&#8722; to NH3 efficiently. The Cu1/WO3 delivered an impressive NH3 production rate of 1274.4 mgN h&#8722;1 gCu&#8722;1, a NH3 selectivity of 99.2%, and a faradaic efficiency of 93.7% at &#8722;0.60&#160;V, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, an integrated continuous&#8208;flow system consisting of a NO3RR cell and a vacuum&#8208;driven membrane separator was developed for NH3 synthesis from nitrate&#8208;contaminated water. Fed with the Yangtze River water containing &#8764;22.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1 of NO3&#8722;&#8208;N, this system realized an NH3 production rate of 325.9 mgN h&#8722;1 gCu&#8722;1 and a collection efficiency of 98.3% at energy consumption of 17.11 kwh gN&#8722;1. This study provides a new dual&#8208;driven concept for catalyst design and establishes a foundation for sustainable NH3 synthesis from waste.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Coupling of Carboxylic Acids with Amines and Alcohols via Ynamide Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acids are readily available chemicals with broad applications in chemistry&#8208;related areas, and their coupling with amines and alcohols is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis. However, the catalytic enantioselective coupling of carboxylic acids remains elusive, especially for the atroposelective reaction. Here we report a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines and alcohols using ynamides as coupling reagents. The novel enantiocontrol involving CBA&#8208;catalyzed ester addition enables the straightforward construction of axially chiral amides and planar&#8208;chiral esters with high enantioselectivities through atroposelective intermolecular amidation and intramolecular macrolactonization. Diverse medicinally relevant carboxylic acids can undergo direct late&#8208;stage modification by this method. Importantly, this reaction represents the first atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines, as well as the first chemocatalytic atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with alcohols. The resulting atropisomeric skeletons can be readily derivatized to chiral ligands and catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput computational screening of small, molecular crystals for sustainable piezoelectric materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next&#8208;generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor&#8208;made solid&#8208;state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co&#8208;crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X&#8208;Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal piezoelectric response (d11/d22/d33). This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amination of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds and Analogous Reactive Enolate&#8208;Precursors Using Ammonia Under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein introduce a method for the direct a&#8208;amination of different carbonyl compounds by employing aqueous ammonia as the N&#8208;source. Upon using NH3 in combination with hypochlorites as simple oxidants under phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions it is possible to carry out the direct a&#8208;amination of reactive enolate&#8208;precursors such as cyclic b&#8208;ketoesters, oxindoles, as well as malonitriles and malonates with good to excellent yields, while simple ketone precursors being out of the scope thus far. Furthermore, a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an asymmetric variant by employing a chiral quaternary ammonium salt is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Deacylative Functionalization towards &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of readily available prochiral or racemic quaternary carbons to access enantioenriched ones offers a promising alternative to conventional synthesis from tertiary or planar substrates. Unlike desymmetrization that modifies an existing substituent with limited reactivity, a functional group swap can install a new motif that is structurally distinct and non&#8208;derivable from the replaced group. However, achieving enantioconvergence in these quaternary&#8208;to&#8208;quaternary transformations is challenging, especially for acyclic stereocenters. Here, we report that acyl groups of &#946;&#8208;ketonitriles can be stereoselectively replaced by allyl, propargyl, or benzyl moieties using easily accessible alcohols under palladium catalysis. The deacylative functionalization proceeds through a retro&#8208;Claisen&#8208;type elimination of ketonitrile with alkoxide and the absence of diastereoisomerism in the resulting ketenimine anion assists the subsequent asymmetric addition. Together with the pair of &#945;&#8208;substituents, the retained nitrile and the incoming alkyl motif instill significant derivatization potential into the enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzamide&#8208;Directed Hydroarylative Cross&#8208;Couplings Using Minimally Activated Alkenes: Enantioselective Synthesis of Tertiary and Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;systems modified with ferrocene&#8208;based homochiral diphosphonite ligands, prepared from functionalized SPINOL derivatives, promote benzamide&#8208;directed hydroarylative cross&#8208;couplings involving minimally activated alkenes. The processes are highly branched selective and enantioselective. Accordingly, tertiary benzylic stereocenters are generated under byproduct free conditions. This contrasts conventional cross&#8208;coupling approaches, which are less step and atom economical. Preliminary results show that the process extends to the formation of quaternary benzylic stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dendritic Oligo&#8208;Glycerol Cationic Surfactants for Enhanced Antibacterial Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance present an ever&#8208;increasing threat to human health worldwide, and medicine urgently needs new alternatives for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. Cationic surfactants have proven to be effective antibacterial agents due to their ability to disrupt bacterial membranes, inhibit biofilm formation, and combat a broad spectrum of pathogens. We employed a orthogonal click chemistry strategy for the efficient modular synthesis of six novel cationic surfactants. Our results emphasize the strong correlation between the surfactant design and its antibacterial potential. Among these six cationic surfactants we identified a prime candidate, which possessed an impressive antibacterial effect against gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria, including drug&#8208;resistant strains. We found that our surfactant can prevent biofilm formation and eradicate already existing biofilms. Cryo&#8208;TEM imaging was used to reveal the membrane&#8208;disrupting properties of the surfactant. In&#8208;vivo wound healing experiments underline the surfactants&#8217; ability to inhibit wound infections. Cationic surfactants often face the challenge of balancing strong antibacterial activity with minimal cytotoxicity. Our strategic design and orthogonal click chemistry approach have enabled precise fine&#8208;tuning of molecular structures to achieve an optimal balance between antibacterial efficacy and biocompatibility, effectively overcoming this critical limitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Binding Energy Is Insufficient for Describing Hydrogen Evolution on Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design principles for metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been extensively studied. While hydrogen binding energy ([[EQUATION]]) has long been used as a HER descriptor during the past decades,&#160;its applicability to HER SACs has been met with significant controversy. Herein, we investigate the effects of HO*/O* poisoning and H* coverage on SACs with varied metal centers and coordination environments using pH&#8208;dependent surface Pourbaix diagrams at the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale and microkinetic modeling. Our findings reveal that HO* poisoning, realistic H* adsorption strengths at active metal sites, and the potential HER activity at the coordinating N&#8208;sites are crucial factors that should be considered for accurate descriptor development. Experimental validation using a series of M&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts&#160;confirms the theoretical predictions, with excellent agreement in exchange current densities and the role of N&#8208;sites in Ni/Cu&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts. More importantly, the controversy surrounding HER SAC design principles is resolved through a novel 2D microkinetic volcano model that incorporates active sites, H* coverage, and HO* poisoning. This work provides answers to a long&#8208;lasting debate on HER descriptors by establishing [[EQUATION]] and [[EQUATION]] as a combined HER descriptor for SACs, offering new guidelines for catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Electrode Surface Chemistry in Determining Interphase Stability and Deposition Homogeneity for Anode&#8208;free Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium metal batteries with an anode&#8208;less/&#8208;free configuration could realize competitive energy density, which requires exceptional potassium plating/stripping reversibility via guiding smooth potassium growth and building mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Electrolyte engineering has been the most widely adopted strategy, but there is less understanding of the electrode effect. We demonstrate that the extent of electrolyte decomposition could also be regulated through electrode surface modification. Elevating the work function of an Al current collector by coating a thin layer of Ni&#8208;decorated carbon nanofiber could greatly suppress the copious solvent reduction, leading to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Such SEIs possess a large elastic deformation energy to accommodate the volume change and a high ionic conductivity to boost the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the potassiophilic nickel species offer abundant active sites to induce homogeneous potassium deposition. Benefiting from the synergy of stable interphases and promoted nucleation, the modified Al enables a 4.4 V anode&#8208;free cell in a normal&#8208;concentration electrolyte without anode precycling.</dc:description>

         <title>The Flexibility of Tetra(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands Controls the Nuclearity and Geometry of Polynuclear MI&#8210;NHC Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of tetrakisimidazolium salts bearing two di(phenylimidazolium)amine groups linked by differently substituted anthracenes has been prepared. These are H4&#8208;1a(PF6)4 (anthracene bridge), H4&#8208;1b(PF6)4 (phenyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge), H4&#8208;1c(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge) and H4&#8208;1d(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl&#8208;anthracene bridge). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that those ligand precursors having the di(phenylimidazolium)amine connected directly to the anthracene experience restricted rotation about the N&#8722;Canthracene bond. Depending on their flexibility, the reaction of the tetrakisimidazolium salts with Ag2O followed by transmetalation with [AuCl(THT)] yielded octanuclear ([Au8(1a)4](PF6)8), tetranuclear ([Au4(1b)2](PF6)4), hexanuclear ([Au6(1c)3](PF6)6) or octanuclear ([Au8(1d)4](PF6)8) assemblies, demonstrating the direct bonding strategy can be employed for the selective synthesis of polynuclear poly&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) metallosupramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

Depending on their flexibility, the reaction of the tetrakisimidazolium salts with Ag2O followed by transmetalation with [AuCl(THT)] yielded octanuclear ([Au8(1a)4](PF6)8), tetranuclear ([Au4(1b)2](PF6)4), hexanuclear ([Au6(1c)3](PF6)6) or octanuclear ([Au8(1d)4](PF6)8) assemblies, demonstrating the direct bonding strategy can be employed for the selective synthesis of polynuclear poly-NHC (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) metallosupramolecular assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;off of Oxygen Electroreduction Catalysts for Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, integrating high active and long&#8208;term durability on SACs is still challenging due to the severe limitations of activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report an integrative electrocatalyst combining isolated Fe sites and MoC nanoparticles (MoC/Fe&#8208;NC). MoC nanoparticles accelerate ORR kinetics via the proton&#8208;feeding effect and optimize Fe site microstructure. Thus, MoC/Fe&#8208;NC exhibits a high alkaline ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.916 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, and exceptional durability of 50k cycles with 5 mV E1/2 loss. The observed ORR performance is further verified in a zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) with a high peak power density of 316 mW cm&#8722;2 and operational stability over 1000 h. Moreover, the fabricated temperature&#8208;adaptive quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB can cycle stably for 150 h under alternating temperatures. Theory calculations and experiment characterizations, involving scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques and distribution of relaxation times analysis, reveal that the excellent capabilities of MoC/Fe&#8208;NC arise from accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, weakened *OH adsorption, and strengthened Fe&#8722;N bonds fueled by MoC nanoparticles. This work sheds light on breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off barrier of SACs for energy&#8208;conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Single Atom Copper Catalyst as a Redox Mediator in the Cathodic Reduction of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of clean electric energy to activate inert compounds has garnered significant attention. Homogeneous redox mediators (RMs) in organic electrosynthesis are effective platforms for this purpose. However, understanding the RM's electronic structure under operational conditions, electron transport processes at the electrode surface, and substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics remains challenging. Here, we synthesized a Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC, named Cu&#8208;N&#8208;P@NC) with a CuN3P1 micro&#8208;coordination structure, employing it as a unique cathode redox mediator. Introducing phosphine atoms into the coordination system allowed modulation of the SAC's electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, optimizing catalyst&#8208;substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics and accelerating electrochemical reactions. Utilizing the heterogeneous SAC strategy, we achieved a novel electro&#8208;reduction coupling ring&#8208;opening reaction of inert quinazolinone frameworks. The Cu&#8208;SAC exhibited exceptionally high catalytic activity and substrate compatibility, operating smoothly at gram&#8208;scale production. Additionally, we applied the SAC to modify 11 natural product molecules. Integrating micro&#8208;coordination environment regulation and theoretical adsorption models elucidated the significant influence of electrode&#8208;RMs&#8208;substrate interactions on reaction kinetics and catalytic efficiency&#8208;a feat challenging for homogeneous RMs. This approach offers a novel pathway for advancing efficient organic electrosynthesis reactions and provides critical insights for mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>From sequence definition to structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete synthetic macromolecules: insights from molecular modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the exquisite properties emerging from the sequence order in nucleic acids and proteins, researchers are increasingly considering synthetic sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules (SDMs) to reach precise functions, e.g. for catalysis, data storage, energy, and health. While researchers develop iterative techniques permitting the synthesis of perfectly defined sequences, there is still an important gap to achieve the desired properties leading to their utilization as materials. This arises from the fact that the effect of the sequence order on the 3D structure is unknown for most&#160;synthetic SDMs. While the Protein Data Bank gathers hundreds of thousands of elucidated 3D structures, and many more computed (using e.g. AlphaFold), extended information on sequence&#8208;structure relationships do not exist yet for synthetic SDMs. To tackle this problem for relatively flexible macromolecules, one can nowadays utilize the existing tools of molecular modeling. In this Review, we report advanced practices to reveal the 3D structures and the interactions, through the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis&#160;applied to different&#160;SDMs. By combining the computational results to the experimental ones, we show the potential of this approach for&#160;understanding sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete macromolecular systems, towards guiding their rational design for specific functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Effects in Membrane&#8208;Electrode&#8208;Assembly CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA)&#8208;based CO electrolysis (COE) has demonstrated the capability to produce C2+ products with high faradaic efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current densities. However, most studies on COE have achieved performance benchmarks under strongly alkaline conditions (e.g., &#8805;1 M KOH, pH &#8805; 14), raising the question of whether such high pH levels are essential for optimal performance. In this study, we investigated the effects of different electrolytes (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) on MEA&#8208;based CO electrolysis, focusing on the influence of pH and the impact of anodic oxidation on the selectivity of various liquid products. By adjusting electrolyte concentration and pH, we achieved significant partial current densities for ethanol (189 &#177; 5 mA cm&#8208;2) and propanol (89 &#177; 4 mA cm&#8208;2) using 0.5 M K2CO3. This high performance is attributed to the creation of a moderate local alkaline environment and the relatively high resistance to anodic oxidation. Additionally, durability measurements emphasized the critical importance of eliminating anodic oxidation to optimize MEA&#8208;based COE for ethanol and propanol production.</dc:description>

         <title>High Voltage Design for Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are recognized as a promising candidate for next generation of safe battery systems, owing to their inherent advantages. However, the performance of traditional ZABs is constrained by a lower theoretical voltage of 1.65 V, presenting a significant challenge in enhancing their practical application. This paper demonstrates a prototype of acid&#8208;alkaline hybrid quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (HSZAB), featuring a unique design in both a new acidic gel electrolyte and battery structure. Our approach involves regulating the electrolyte pH and ionic conductivity to achieve an enhanced theoretical voltage, resulting in an open circuit voltage of up to 2.0 V. Additionally, the HSZAB demonstrates substantially improved peak power density (417 mW cm&#8208;&#178;, five times higher than the conventional alkaline ZABs) and increased energy efficiency (from 60% to 82%). This finding underscores the promising prospects of high voltage zinc&#8208;air batteries, offering a substantial step forward in the field of energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Interfacial Chemistry and Ion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Enable Reversible Magnesium Metal Anode in Chloride&#8208;Free Mg(TFSI)2 Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of magnesium (Mg) anode in the chloride&#8208;free magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) electrolyte is a key challenge for Mg metal batteries. Tailoring solvation structure and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been considered an effective strategy. Herein, a series of imidazole co&#8208;solvents with different branched&#8208;chain structures (methyl, ethyl and propyl) are introduced into the Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;ether electrolyte to address the passivation issue. The ion&#8208;solvent interaction, interfacial adsorption effect and SEI formation are comprehensively studied by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations. Through molecular structure analysis, the long&#8208;chain 1&#8208;propylimidazole (PrIm) exhibits a strong coordination ability to Mg2+ and a favorable parallel adsorption configuration on the Mg surface. As a result, PrIm co&#8208;solvent can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel a part of TFSI&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface. Benefited from the synergistic regulation effect of interfacial chemistry and ion&#8208;solvent interactions, the chloride&#8208;free Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;DME+PrIm electrolyte ensures a minimal interface passivation and achieves highly reversible Mg plating/stripping. This work provides a guiding strategy for solvation structure regulation and interface engineering for rechargeable Mg metal battery.</dc:description>

Herein, a series of imidazole co-solvents with different branched-chain structures (methyl, ethyl and propyl) are introduced into the Mg(TFSI)2-ether electrolyte to address the passivation issue. The ion-solvent interaction, interfacial adsorption effect and SEI formation are comprehensively studied by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations. Through molecular structure analysis, the long-chain 1-propylimidazole (PrIm) exhibits a strong coordination ability to Mg2+ and a favorable parallel adsorption configuration on the Mg surface. As a result, PrIm co-solvent can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel a part of TFSI- and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface. Benefited from the synergistic regulation effect of interfacial chemistry and ion-solvent interactions, the chloride-free Mg(TFSI)2-DME+PrIm electrolyte ensures a minimal interface passivation and achieves highly reversible Mg plating/stripping. This work provides a guiding strategy for solvation structure regulation and interface engineering for rechargeable Mg metal battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Upcycling of Polyolefin Waste to Light Aromatics via Coupling C&#8208;C Scission and Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The upcycling of waste polyolefins into light aromatics has great potential to generate hundreds of millions of tons of valuable aromatic carbon feedstock. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature radical cracking method for aromatizing polyolefins on zeolites faces challenges in aromaticity control and rapid deactivation due to coke. Here, we present a unique strategy that integrates traditional cracking&#8208;aromatization process&#160;of PE&#160;with CO insertion, a key step of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, achieving a rise of yield of light aromatics by 4 times, with an&#160;absolute value up to 67% by weight at only 280 &#176;C. The insertion of CO into the Ru&#8208;alkyl intermediates formed during polyolefin cracking facilitates the generation of active oxygenate species, guarantees an ideal C&#8208;C chain length range, and smoothing the way for subsequent efficient aromatization on Hol&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5@S1 with a short b&#8208;axis. According to the technical economic analysis, this low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint and economic approach can reduce approximately 1/3 of carbon emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking technologies, and holds promise for reshaping the global aromatic hydrocarbon cycle of petrochemical industry through polyolefin degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Mn&#8208;Br Hybrid Perovskite Assembled by Achiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in various advanced technological fields. CPL activity typically requires compounds that crystallize in noncentrosymmetric chiral space groups. Achieving noncentrosymmetric crystal structures using achiral molecular architectures is highly appealing but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance CPL materials via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using achiral architectures. We successfully obtained Mn2+&#8208;based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1), self&#8208;assembled from [MnBr4]2&#8208; anions and rotational symmetric [Pr&#8208;dabco]2+ cations (Pr&#8208;dabco2+ = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), crystallizing in the chiral space group P212121. The single crystals of 1 exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance, with a luminescence dissymmetry factor |glum| and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 4.8&#215;10&#8208;2 and 86.8%, respectively, thus a record&#8208;high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#215;10&#8208;2 among reported Mn2+&#8208;based CPL materials. Furthermore, P/M&#8208;1 based UV&#8208;LED devices demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;emitting performance, including high color&#8208;purity, excellent stability, remarkable luminous brightness (74,591.94 cd m&#8208;2), and a high electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 3.6&#215;10&#8208;2. This study offers a robust strategy for the design and development of high&#8208;performance CPL materials utilizing achiral molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis and Spiral&#8208;Stair&#8208;Like Single Helix Assembly of Figure&#8208;Eight Cyclophenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helix assemblies of chiral molecules can transfer microscopic unimolecular chirality to macroscopic supramolecular chirality, enhancing various chiral properties. In addition to the commonly observed spiral&#8208;column&#8208;like helix assembly, a small number of spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like helix assemblies have also been reported in aromatic nanocarbons with multiple chirality&#8208;related irregularities. However, they require separation of diastereomers and/or enantiomers or do not have stable chirality. Here, we report the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylenes with stable helical chirality by the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed four consecutive intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloadditions of dodecaynes with two flexible biphenyl units. The chiral figure&#8208;eight [10]cyclophenylene with ethyl and methyl side chains exhibits the spiral&#8208;stair&#8208;like single helix assembly in the crystal due to CH&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;O interactions and good CPL properties in solution. Experimental verification of the enantio&#8208; and diastereodetermining steps of four consecutive [2+2+2] cycloadditions is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical&#8208;Enzymatic Conversion of PET to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Ru&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reforming presents a sustainable route for the conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8208;) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH). However, its widespread application has been constrained by low selectivity due to the complexity of reduction processes and thus energy scaling limitations. In this study, the atomically dispersed Ru sites in Co3O4 synergistically interact with Co centers, facilitating the adsorption and activation of hydroxyl radicals (OH*) and ethylene glycol (EG), resulting in a remarkable HCOOH selectivity of 99 % and a yield rate of 11.2 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 surpassing that of pristine Co3O4 (55 % and 3.8 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2). Furthermore, when applied as a bifunctional cathode catalyst, Ru&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5 % for NH3 production (3.54 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE. Additionally, we developed a prototype device powered by a commercial silicon photovoltaic cell, enabling on&#8208;site solar&#8208;driven production of formate and NH3 through enzyme&#8208;catalyzed PET and NO3&#8208; conversion. This study offers a viable approach for waste valorization and green chemical production, paving the way for sustainable energy applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ortho&#8208;carboranyl carbophosphinocarbene (CPC) has been synthesized through a click&#8208;type reaction between the super strained carborane&#8208;fused borirane 1,2&#8208;BN(SiMe3)2&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 and Bestmann ylide Ph3PCCO. The [Cl(CO)2Ir&#8208;CPC] and [Cl3Ga&#8208;CPC] complexes were synthesized, allowing the measurement of their Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and the sum of Cl&#8208;Ga&#8208;Cl bond angles (&#8721;ClGaCl), respectively. These data highlight their remarkable electron&#8208;donating ability. Further insights into its electron donating properties were gained through theoretical calculations, including analysis of frontier orbitals and proton affinity (PA). Preliminary reactivity investigations demonstrate that the new CPC readily forms adducts with boranes and can effectively stabilize borenium cations. Its strong nucleophilicity enables reactions with carbon dioxide, while its exceptional Br&#248;nsted basicity allows it to deprotonate imidazolium to generate carbene species.</dc:description>

         <title>Avoiding the Kauzmann Paradox via Interface&#8208;Driven Divergence in States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kauzmann paradox suggests that deeply supercooled liquids can have a lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline solids. While this entropy catastrophe has been thoroughly studied via equilibrium thermodynamics, the solidification process occurs far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium. By analyzing this process experimentally and theoretically, we show that surface speciation in core&#8208;shell particles can perturb the entropy production to an extent that a continuum equilibrium phase transition is not possible. Speciation of the surface causes divergence of associated stress vectors that generate nonequilibrium fluxes and frustrates homogeneous nucleation hence deep undercooling. The asymmetry of the speciation&#8208;derived surface tensor skews the minimum entropy production criterion. We analyze a set of nonequilibrium models, one showing and one averting the entropy catastrophe. Applying thermodynamic speed limits to these models, we show that the Kauzmann paradox takes another form. Deviations from the speed limit diverges the configurational entropy of the glass, but adding an interfacial state avoids the entropy catastrophe with significantly large supercooling.</dc:description>

While this entropy catastrophe has been thoroughly studied via equilibrium thermodynamics, the solidification process occurs far-from-equilibrium. By analyzing this process experimentally and theoretically, we show that surface speciation in core-shell particles can perturb the entropy production to an extent that a continuum equilibrium phase transition is not possible. Speciation of the surface causes divergence of associated stress vectors that generate nonequilibrium fluxes and frustrates homogeneous nucleation hence deep undercooling. The asymmetry of the speciation-derived surface tensor skews the minimum entropy production criterion. We analyze a set of nonequilibrium models, one showing and one averting the entropy catastrophe. Applying thermodynamic speed limits to these models, we show that the Kauzmann paradox takes another form. Deviations from the speed limit diverges the configurational entropy of the glass, but adding an interfacial state avoids the entropy catastrophe with significantly large supercooling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gromomycins: An Unprecedented Class of Triterpene Antibiotics Produced by a Novel Biosynthetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current situation with drug&#8208;resistant microbial pathogens is critical dictating an acute need for novel efficient antibiotics. Herein, we report a new class of antibiotics entitled gromomycins with significant activity especially against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including methicillin&#8208; and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Gromomycins are pentacyclic triterpenes with a cyclic guanidino group forming the fifth six&#8208;membered ring. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify the gromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster since it could not be assigned by any available bioinformatics tools, highlighting its unique biosynthetic route. Using gene cluster engineering, feeding experiments, LC&#8208;MS and NMR analyses we have proposed the biosynthetic pathway for gromomycins, which are the first bacterial triterpenes synthesized independently of the squalene pathway. They also exhibit a so far unprecedented cyclization route that utilizes a hexaprenylguanidine linear precursor. Leveraging our understanding of their biosynthesis, we have identified additional gromomycin producers, resulting in the isolation of novel bioactive derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tuning the catalytic pathways of atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts  (SAC) has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize their overall catalytic activity. Herein, we present Ru1@m&#8208;tube, a hollow carbon nitride&#8208;supported Ru SAC, coated with eutectic galinstan (GaInSn), as a model catalyst, we demonstrate a performance inversion in  vanillin  conversion. Vanillin, as a biomass&#8208;derived compound with industrial relevance, presents challenges in catalytic hydrogenation, making it an ideal model reaction to test and compare the catalyst's selectivity and efficiency. The as&#8208;obtained Ru1@m&#8208;tube(GaInSn) achieved nearly 100% vanillin conversion within 5 hours  and exhibited an impressive 93.8% selectivity for vanillyl alcohol . Electron spillover from gallium&#8208;based eutectic alloys to highly diluted ruthenium sites enhances the desorption of vanillyl alcohol, resulting in an exceptional performance shift between hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Our findings not only offer a novel approach  for modulating SAC performance via liquid&#8208;metal interfaces but also expand the understanding of promoter screening for various challenging reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Triangular Cu3&#160;Motif Steers CO2&#160;Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of CO2 using copper&#8208;based multi&#8208;atom catalysts (MACs) offers a potential approach to achieve value&#8208;added C2+ products. However, achieving MACs with high metal contents and suppressing the thermodynamically favored competing ethylene production pathway remain challenging, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance in ethanol production. Herein, we developed a &#8216;pre&#8208;locking and nanoconfined polymerization&#8217; strategy for synthesis of an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density Cu MAC with low&#8208;coordination triangular Cu3 motifs (Cu3 MAC) on polymeric carbon nitride mesoporous nanofibers. The Cu3 MAC with Cu contents of 36&#8201;wt% achieves a high reactivity of 117 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 for ethanol production from CO2 and H2O, with a remarkable selectivity of 98% under simulated sunlight irradiation, representing one of the highest performances in ambient conditions without sacrificial reagents. The superior catalytic efficiency is attributed to the triangular Cu3 configuration, in which both Cu(I) and Cu(II) coexist, predominantly as Cu(I). Such Cu3 motifs act as strong alkaline sites that effectively chemisorb and activate CO2, extend visible&#8208;light absorption range, while accumulating high&#8208;density electrons and favoring 12&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer products. An accelerated asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling with adsorption configuration of the bridge&#8208;adsorbed *CO at paired Cu sites and atop&#8208;adsorbed *CO at adjacent single Cu atom was observed, enabling preferential formation of *CHCHOH intermediates to produce ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Optical Waveguides Based on Serpentine&#8208;like Organic Pseudo&#8208;Plastic&#160;Crystals that Mimic Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical components and circuits for signal generation and processing are essential for artificial neural networks (ANNs). We present a four&#8208;layered organic optical waveguide architecture that mimics an ANN. This structure is constructed from flexible organic crystals of (E)&#8208;1&#8208;(((5&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MPyIN) using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip&#8208;based micromanipulation technique. By strategically selecting four MPyIN crystal waveguides of varying lengths, bending them into serpentine&#8208;like forms, and integrating them hierarchically, we create interconnected, neuron&#8208;like optical waveguides with six optical synapses. These synapses enable parallel transmission of passive optical signals through evanescent coupling across multiple paths within the waveguides. The feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to split the input optical signal into four diverging signals with different magnitudes. Certain outputs combine passive and active signals due to diverging and converging optical paths. This hierarchical, ANN&#8208;like architecture offers a foundation for developing smart optical neural networks using multiple emissive and phase&#8208;changing organic crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Intervalence Charge Transfer and Exothermic and Isoenergetic Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in Far&#8208;Red Capturing Zinc Phthalocyanine Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orientation and distance&#8208;dependent intervalence charge transfer phenomenon is demonstrated in far&#8208;red capturing zinc phthalocyanine dimers connected by a bis&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenyl &#960;&#8208;spacer (ortho, meta, or para positions) upon oxidizing one of the phthalocyanine rings, resulting in split oxidation waves and a new optical transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. Optical studies initially probed the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation events in these dimers wherein solvent polarity&#8208;dependent quenching was witnessed. Interestingly, efficient quenching in nonpolar toluene was also seen for the ortho&#8208;dimer. Free&#8208;energy calculations supported symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in polar solvents and the ortho&#8208;dimer even in nonpolar solvents under isoenergetic (endothermic by ~40 mV) conditions. Molecular electrostatic potential maps generated on DFT&#8208;optimized structures revealed quadrupolar charge transfer states, more so in polar media. The time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations revealed the conversion of the quadrupolar charge transfer states to bipolar charge&#8208;separated states from different singlet&#8208;singlet excitations. Femtosecond transient absorption studies covering broad temporal and spatial scales provided evidence for the charge separation process, including that for the ortho&#8208;dimer in toluene, where an isoenergetic process was predicted. The charge&#8208;separated states lasted for 200&#8208;500 ps depending upon dimer linkage. These unprecedented findings reveal the potential applications of the investigated phthalocyanine dimers in energy harvesting, photocatalytic, and pertinent optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Blue&#8208;Emitting Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or v&#8208;DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.







Abstract
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs).

     alt="Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi-Resonance TADF Blue-Emitting Organic Light-Emitting Diodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence-sensitized multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR-TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-Ir(tpz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). High-performance blue OLEDs still pose a considerable challenge. Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronic technologies. In this study, we designed a series of original high-triplet PHC materials based on a multi-substitution approach of the 9,9&#8242;-spirobifluorene (SBF) backbone and used them, for the first time, as a host in phosphorescence-sensitized multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) OLEDs. Devices based on the 2,6-bis(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac-Ir(tpz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR-TADF OLED devices based on &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full-width at half-maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll-off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence-sensitized MR-TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next-generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high-performance devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Theophylline to Adenine or preQ1: Repurposing a DNA Aptamer Revealed by Crystal Structure Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers, which are short, single&#8208;stranded DNA or RNA, are capable of binding to a wide array of targets with exceptional selectivity. Those with high affinity for theophylline have the potential to serve as biosensors, crucial for tracking theophylline levels in the treatment of respiratory conditions. Despite the extensive structural characterization of the RNA theophylline aptamer, the DNA counterpart&#8217;s ligand&#8208;recognition mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we elucidate the DNA theophylline aptamer&#8217;s ligand&#8208;binding mechanism through high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of its complexes with theophylline, 3&#8208;methylxanthine, and hypoxanthine. Guided by these structural insights, we computationally redesigned the theophylline&#8208;binding pocket via rational mutagenesis of key nucleotides, generating novel aptamers selective for adenine and prequeuosine (preQ1) ligands. These engineered aptamers were validated through biochemical and crystallographic analyses. By integrating structural biology with computational design, our work provides a relatively simple and effective method for developing new aptamers. While this strategy does not supplant SELEX, it serves as a beneficial complement to it.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Temperature Depolymerization of Polymethacrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The depolymerization of polymers synthesized by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential for recovering monomer at low temperatures. However, current reports focus solely on polymethacrylates, significantly limiting applications, scope, and fundamental understanding. Although polymethacrylamides are highly valued for their excellent biocompatibility, anti&#8208;bacterial properties, and water solubility, their chemical recycling remains experimentally unattainable, irrespective of their synthesis method (i.e. free radical, RDRP, anionic, etc.). Herein, we present the first example of thermal reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer&#160;(RAFT) depolymerization of various polymethacrylamides, regenerating monomers at high yields. Central to our work was the identification of two key weaknesses associated with polymethacrylamides, namely (i) insufficient end&#8208;group activation, and (ii) premature end&#8208;group loss at higher temperatures, leading to compromised monomer yields and low depolymerization rates. These challenges were bypassed via the addition of commercially available radical initiators, resulting in faster reactions and higher percentages of recovered monomer at as low as 90 &#176;C. The broad applicability of this method was further demonstrated by its compatibility with various RAFT&#8208;agents, and the possibility to depolymerize a crosslinked hydrogel. Our work expands the depolymerization scope of high&#8208;value materials beyond polymethacrylates and shines a light on intriguing thermodynamic and kinetic insights.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate the highly selective, active and long&#8208;term durable electrocatalytic production of ethylene from CO2 by constructing a Cu2O nano&#8208;homojunction, which is composed of Cu2O nanocubes in size of ~100 nm and the surface&#8208;adhered Cu2O nanodots in size of ~12 nm, as electrocatalyst.&#160;&#160;The maximum Faradaic efficiency of ethylene can reach 73.7% at &#8722;1.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in H&#8208;type cell, with partial current density to ethylene of 38.2 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it can work stably for more than 200 h at 0.31 A cm&#8722;2 in membrane electrode assembly. The mechanism for the high selectivity, activity and stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion was investigated by in&#8208;situ experiments and theoretical calculations.

         <title>A DNP&#8208;Supported Solid&#8208;State NMR Approach to Study Nucleic Acids In Situ Reveals Berberine&#8208;Stabilized Hoogsteen Structures in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria are vital for energy production and rely on intricate nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression. Using DNP&#8208;ssNMR (dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR), we observed G&#8208;quadruplex formation in intact mitochondria treated with berberine. This method enables detailed studies of mitochondrial nucleic acids in their native environment, advancing research into mitochondrial diseases and therapies.








Abstract
Mitochondria are central to cellular bioenergetics, with the unique ability to translate and transcribe a subset of their own proteome. Given the critical importance of energy production, mitochondria seem to utilize higher&#8208;order nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression, much like nuclei. Herein, we introduce a tailored approach to probe the formation of such structures, specifically G&#8208;quadruplexes, within intact mitochondria by using sensitivity&#8208;enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization&#8208;supported solid&#8208;state NMR (DNP&#8208;ssNMR). We acquired NMR spectra on isolated intact isotopically labeled mitochondria treated with berberine, a known high&#8208;affinity G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer. The DNP&#8208;ssNMR data revealed spectral changes in nucleic acid sugar correlations, increased signal intensity for guanosine carbons, and enhanced Hoogsteen hydrogen bond formation, providing evidence of in vivo G&#8208;quadruplex formation in mitochondria. Together, our workflow enables the study of mitochondrial nucleic acid&#8208;ligand interactions at endogenous concentrations within biologically relevant environments by DNP&#8208;ssNMR, thus paving the way for future research into mitochondrial diseases and their potential treatments.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Conduction Band and Defect Engineering for the Prominent Visible&#8208;Light Responsive Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance H&#8322; evolution via water splitting, preventing deep electron traps&#8212;&#8208;often formed by anion vacancies&#8212;&#8208;is essential. Transient IR absorption spectroscopy reveals that 2D layered materials like Bi&#8324;NbOCl rarely form such traps. This is due to the formation of a defect&#8208;tolerant, bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum, which effectively suppresses deep traps while maintaining high electron reactivity. Addressing this issue has been a major focus in photocatalysis research, as reported by Akira Yamakata, Takafumi Ogawa, and Hiroshi Kageyama et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202419624).

Addressing this issue has been a major focus in photocatalysis research, as reported by Akira Yamakata, Takafumi Ogawa, and Hiroshi Kageyama et&#160;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a target="_blank"

         <title>AIE Bottlebrush Polymers: Verification of Internal Crowdedness in Bottlebrush Polymers Using the AIE Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers are a unique class of macromolecules with densely grafted side chains along a central long backbone. A comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single bottlebrush polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging. Here, we synthesized AIEgen&#8208;based bottlebrush polymers using ROMP. The expected AIE phenomenon clearly visualized the steric crowding effect among the densely grafted side chains in bottlebrush polymers.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers, characterized by densely grafted side chains along a central backbone, have gained significant interest due to their unique properties in bulk and solution states. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging, and direct evidence to visualize and manifest this effect is scarce. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) offers a novel method to address this challenge. To achieve this, a vinyl&#8208;derivatized AIE monomer was polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in a controlled way. Afterward, the end group of the synthesized polymer chain was transformed to azide, which was coupled with an alkyne&#8208;derivatized norbornene unit using click chemistry to produce the macromonomer. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the norbornenyl macromonomer using Grubbs catalyst, (H2IMes)(pyr)2(Cl)2Ru&#160;=&#160;CHPh (G3), resulted in well&#8208;defined bottlebrush polymers in a highly efficient way. We studied the polymerization behavior and characterized the single chain conformation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution together with coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CG&#8208;MD) simulation. Photoluminescence investigation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution revealed the expected AIE phenomenon, thus verifying the steric crowding effects within bottlebrush polymers. This work bridges AIE technology with polymer science and especially bottlebrush polymers. By doing this, our research not only broadens the bottlebrush polymer library but also provides insights into bottlebrush polymer chain study for potential applications.

         <title>Gem&#8208;Diboronic Acids: A Motif for Anion Recognition in Competitive Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diboronic acids are an anion recognition motif that provides strong and directional binding to oxoanions in aqueous media. This motif provides a selectivity profile that is distinct from other anion recognition groups, and binding affinities that are superior to those of simple amides and (thio)ureas. A simple receptor featuring two gem&#8208;diboronic acid motifs was found to be one of the most selective malonate receptors disclosed to date.








Abstract
Gem&#8208;diboronic acid derivatives have previously been demonstrated to facilitate substrate binding within a metal's secondary coordination sphere, but their use as an anion recognition motif has not been explored. Here, we introduce the gem&#8208;diboronic acid motif as a highly effective group for recognition of oxoanions in aqueous solution. Anion receptors based on this motif demonstrate higher binding affinities than other common neutral motifs such as amides and (thio)ureas, and display a unique selectivity profile. Studies with a receptor bearing two gem&#8208;diboronic acid groups, receptor 2, indicate that the interaction with anions is highly directional. Despite its simplicity, receptor 2 represents one of the most selective receptors for malonate reported to date.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Exploration of Chemical Space of MOF&#8208;5 Analogs for Enhanced C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study outlines a data&#8208;driven approach for identifying potential candidates for effectively separating C2H6/C2H4 mixtures. By integrating machine learning and molecular simulations, the chemical space of MOF&#8208;5 analogs was explored for large C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The most promising MOF was synthesized, and its exceptional C2H6/C2H4 separation capability was validated through experimentation. 








Abstract
Adsorptive separation using C2H6&#8208;selective adsorbents can produce high&#8208;purity C2H4 directly, making it an energy&#8208;efficient separation method with the potential to replace cryogenic distillation. Although many C2H6&#8208;selective MOFs have been reported, developing MOFs with both large C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we present a machine learning&#8211;assisted molecular simulation strategy to explore the C2H6/C2H4 separation capability of pcu&#8208;MOFs isoreticular to MOF&#8208;5. The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm showed high accuracy in predicting the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity and C2H6 uptake, where Henry coefficient ratio (S0) and Henry coefficient of C2H6 (K(C2H6)) were identified as key factors. We further synthesized the top&#8208;performing MOF termed A&#8208;66 and experimentally verified its large C2H6 adsorption capacity and excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance. This work provides a valuable strategy for exploring the chemical space of MOF&#8208;5 analogs and identifying promising candidates for the efficient purification of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical C&#9472;H Chlorination of Terminal Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free electrochemical method for the chlorination of terminal C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds of alkanes is described. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied in flow electrochemistry and used for kilogram&#8208;scale production.








Abstract
Although research on the activation of C&#9472;H bonds in alkanes has been ongoing for decades, there are still few strategies that are both highly selective and suitable for industrial production. Herein, we report a highly selective method for the chlorination of terminal C&#9472;H bonds in alkanes by combining electrochemistry and organocatalysis. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied to kilogram&#8208;scale production.

The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied to kilogram-scale production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Miniaturized Separation&#8208;Sensing Tandem Enabled by Fluorescent Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bifunctional porous fluorescent monoliths were synthesized for the first time inside a capillary column, enabling a miniaturized separation&#8208;sensing platform for mixture sensing. This platform not only realizes quantitative analysis for trace water in methanol, a sarin simulant, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and metal ions but also shows baseline separation for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene at nanogram levels.








Abstract
Discriminative sensing for mixture by either fluorescent sensor or other sensors remains a challenge. This issue is attributed to the absence of a separation unit prior to the sensor. Here, we report a new sensing medium, named porous fluorescent monolith, which can separate mixture and meanwhile be integrated into a sensor for discriminative detection. The fluorescent monoliths are prepared via polymerization of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8244;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde with diamines. Their photophysical property and hierarchical porosity are systematically studied. On this basis, we set up a separation&#8208;sensing platform and realize quantitative analysis for trace water in methanol, a sarin simulant, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and metal ions. The separation&#8208;sensing platform furthermore demonstrates baseline separation for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, with limit of detections of 86, 54, 19, and 58&#160;ng, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a fluorescent monolith is used to realize a separation&#8208;sensing tandem. We anticipate our findings will provide a promising strategy for producing portable devices with the on&#8208;site discriminative sensing ability for real samples.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanostructure Monolayers as SERS Substrates for Ultrasensitive Detection of Enantiomer Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral gold nanostructures induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8211;leucine (D&#9472;/L&#9472;CL) dipeptide were used as SERS substrates for the detection of chiral molecules, specifically D&#8208;kynurenine (Kyn), which would be a new biomarker of Alzheimer's disease for clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
The early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), requires the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers. Detecting chiral molecules at concentrations relevant to disease states remains challenging. Herein, a new type of chiral gold nanostructure induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8211;leucine dipeptides with a g&#8208;factor of 0.1 was successfully synthesized for enantiomer biomarker detection.&#160;To enhance the discrimination performance, the chiral gold nanostructures were assembled into D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers. As surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, the D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers simultaneously deliver molecular structural specificity and enantioselectivity within a single spectrum, which can be a versatile, label&#8208;free chiral discrimination strategy for the detection of D&#8208;/L&#8208;kynurenine (Kyn). The mechanism was unveiled to involve high enantioselective adsorption energies between L&#8208; and D&#8208;Kyn on the lattice plane (221), resulting in enantioselective sensing.&#160;The results showed that the L&#8208;Au monolayer reached a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.7&#160;nm for L&#8208;Kyn, while the D&#8208;Au monolayer reached an LOD of 3.6&#160;nM for D&#8208;Kyn.&#160;Notably, there was a significant difference in D&#8208;Kyn levels between AD patients and healthy individuals in serum samples, a distinction not observed for L&#8208;Kyn, which positioned D&#8208;Kyn as a potential novel biomarker for clinical prediagnosis of AD patients, marking the first report of its kind worldwide.&#160;This study provides a robust tool for advancing biomedical science and clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Ligand Modulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Derived Regenerable Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;FeOOH coated Ni&#8208;catecholate metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;CAT MOF) catalyst converts into ligand&#8208;coordinated &#947;&#8208;NiFeOOH species during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which can revert to more stable &#945;&#8208;phase counterparts, showing &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;regenerate&#8221; characteristics. The ligand enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates, strengthens bonding states, and electron delocalization interactions, leading to superior catalytic OER performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as promising pre&#8208;catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, the coordination chemistry of MOF ligands in reconstructed species remains poorly understood, particularly regarding how ligand modulation influences the electronic configurations of catalytic sites. In this study, we present the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;FeOOH coated Ni&#8208;catecholate MOF composite (FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT), which transforms into a ligand&#8208;coordinated &#947;&#8208;NiFeOOH active species during OER. Notably, this active species can revert to its stable &#945;&#8208;phase counterpart, exhibiting an &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;regenerate&#8221; characteristic. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ligand significantly enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates involved in the OER, while also modulating electronic structures by strengthening bonding states and promoting electron delocalization between active sites and intermediates. As a result, the FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT pre&#8208;catalyst exhibits exceptional OER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 180&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and impressive durability over 384&#160;h (16 days), leveraging the regenerable property. This work advances the understanding of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts by elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of structural reconstruction during OER and highlighting the role of ligand modulation in improving OER activity.

         <title>Alcohol Self&#8208;Aggregation: the Preferred Configurations of the Ethanol Trimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isomers of the ethanol trimer were identified by their rotational spectra aided by extensive quantum chemical calculations. All aggregates show cyclic structures linking the &#8722;OH groups through O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds, and additional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. Gauche ethanol conformations are prevalent but there is no homochirality synchronization. Our results underscore the critical changes involved in alcohol aggregation as size increases.







Abstract
An atomic&#8208;level knowledge of the aggregation of archetypal molecular systems is essential to accurately model supramolecular structures and the transition from gas to liquid phase. The structures and forces involved in ethanol aggregation have been investigated using microwave spectroscopy and extensive quantum chemical calculations. Four isomers of the ethanol trimer have been observed and identified based on comparisons between experimental and predicted spectroscopic parameters, and considering collisional relaxation in the supersonic expansion. All observed isomers exhibit O&#8722;H

         <title>Simultaneous Fabrication of P and M Helices in One&#8208;Component Chiral System by Methanol&#8208;Water Mediated Dual Assembly Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of L&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices.







Abstract
The synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures stemmed from same building units is ubiquitous in nature and vital to living systems, but achieving it in artificial systems remains a challenge. Herein, we report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of l&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH due to the hydrogen bonds as well as C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between LBpyF and CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways and double networks of P and M helices were therefore formed, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices. The bipyridine core, phenyl ring, amide unit all adapted into different stacking modes in M&#8208;helices and P&#8208;helices, and energy analysis indicated that the minority M&#8208;helices were more thermodynamically favored products. This study provides an approach to explore synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures by manipulating the multiple assembly pathway.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Characterization of Native Bacterial Biofilms via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization&#8208;Enhanced Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms cause persistent infections and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. We utilized for the first time hyperpolarized DNP solid&#8208;state NMR to structurally characterize native bacterial biofilm. We collected 1D/2D spectra within seconds/minutes and detected polysaccharide, protein and other signals. These structural information will boost structure&#8208;guided approaches for combating biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are major contributors to persistent infections and antimicrobial resistance, posing significant challenges to treatment. However, obtaining high&#8208;resolution structural information on native bacterial biofilms has remained elusive due to the methodological limitations associated with analyzing complex biological samples. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) has shown promise in this regard, but its conventional application is hindered by sensitivity constraints for unlabeled samples. In this study, we utilized high&#8208;sensitivity Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) ssNMR to characterize native Pseudomonas fluorescens colony biofilms. The ~75&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement provided by DNP enabled structural characterization without isotope labeling or chemical/physical modification. We successfully collected 1D 13C/15N, and 2D 1H&#8722;13C, 1H&#8722;15N and 13C&#8722;13C ssNMR spectra within seconds, minutes or hours, facilitating the identification and quantification of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Additionally, DNP ssNMR allowed quantitative detection of both flexible and rigid biofilm components by favorable freezing conditions. This study represents the first application of ultrasensitive DNP ssNMR to characterize a native bacterial biofilm, significantly expanding the capabilities of ssNMR for analyzing the composition and structure of a wide array of in&#8197;vitro and ex&#8197;vivo biofilms. The versatility of this approach will accelerate structure&#8208;guided efforts to combat infections caused by biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.

         <title>Mechanics&#8208;Photophysics Correlation in Tough, Stretchable and Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence Ionogels Deciphered by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) spectra to establish mechanics&#8208;DMA&#8208;photophysics correlation for ionogels. This resembles parallel and sequential processing of human brain from sensation to cognition. This work provides an enabling strategy towards the early indication of performance of ionogels without laborious characterization.







Abstract
The development of tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials holds great significance for manufacturing and processing photoluminescent materials, but limited techniques are available to profile their mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation. Here we report glassy ionogels, and their mechanical properties and photophysical properties are fused by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), functioning like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking sensory perception and cognition. Depending on two special temperatures presented in DMA curves, Tloss (the peak of loss modulus (E&#8221;)) and Tg (glass transition temperature), the ionogels can vary from being either tough with persistent phosphorescence, extensible with effective phosphorescence or resilience with inefficient phosphorescence. Leveraging this method, we achieve stretchable and long&#8208;lived RTP ionogels with tensile yield strength of 53&#8197;MPa, tensile strain of 497&#8201;%, Young's modulus of 782&#8197;MPa, toughness of 111.2&#8197;MJ/m3, and lifetime of 113.05&#8197;ms. Our work provides a simple yet powerful method to reveal the mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation of RTP ionogels, to predict their performance without laborious synthesis and characterization, opening new avenues for applications of RTP materials, including applications in harsh conditions (257&#8197;K or 347&#8197;K), shape memory and shape reconstruction.

         <title>Diastereoselective Polypseudorotaxane Formation with Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Co&#8208;crystallization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation was achieved through the simple co&#8208;crystallization of a diastereomeric pillar[5]arene macrocycle and poly(ethylene glycol). During the co&#8208;crystallization process, the concentration gradually increased, allowing the pillar[5]arene and poly(ethylene glycol) to assemble closely. Consequently, the matched packing of the pillar[5]arene side chains facilitated the cooperative arrangement of pillar[5]arenes with the same chirality along the polymer chain.







Abstract
As the number of chiral ring molecules in chiral polyrotaxane increases, the number of possible stereoisomers exponentially increases. Consequently, the selective synthesis of a specific stereoisomer becomes much more challenging. To address this problem, we co&#8208;crystallized poly(ethylene glycol) and a diastereomeric ring molecule, pillar[5]arene, in the solid state. The co&#8208;crystallization formed polypseudorotaxanes with a high diastereomeric excess (ca. 88&#8201;% de), meaning that polypseudorotaxanes containing (S, pS) stereoisomer pillar[5]arene rings were synthesized selectively. By contrast, in solution and evaporation systems, the selectivity remained low (ca. 10&#8201;% de). The results suggested that the packing effect by the co&#8208;crystallization contributed to the denser assembly of ring molecules on the polymeric chain, resulting in the diastereoselective formation. High diastereoselectivity was also observed even in higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene glycol)s. These selectivities arose from the cooperative effects of the ring molecules on the polymeric chain, which were supported by calculating the stabilization energy.

         <title>Optimized Adsorption of Had and OHad over Amorphous SrRuPtOxHy Nanobelts towards Efficient Alkaline Fuel Cell Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a new class of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs) with excellent performance towards alkaline HOR and AEMFCs. Electrochemical experiments and calculations collectively show that a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs have optimized HBE and OHBE as well as low HOR barrier, which all greatly improve the HOR efficiency.







Abstract
PtRu&#8208;based catalysts toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffer from low efficiency, CO poisoning and over&#8208;oxidation at high potentials. In this work, an amorphization strategy is adopted for preparation of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs). The a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs has optimized adsorption of intermediates (H and OH), increased number of active sites, highly weakened CO poisoning and enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation ability owing to the special amorphous structure. Consequently, a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs displays superior HOR performance with a mass activity of 7.5&#8197;A/mgPt+Ru, 25 and 5&#8197;times of that of SrRuPt(OH)x NBs and commercial PtRu/C, respectively, and long&#8208;lasting stability. Besides, a peak power density of 750&#8197;mW/cm2 and a specific power of 14.8&#8197;W/mgPt+Ru have been achieved for a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs at a low loading of 0.05&#8197;mgPt+Ru/cm2, surpassing many reported HOR catalysts. Mechanism investigation indicates that Pt and Ru are present in oxide/hydroxide forms and H in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs participates in HOR. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that there are three catalytic mechanisms participating in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs, which all exhibit low catalytic barrier and highly improved HOR efficiency. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts towards fuel cells.

         <title>Artificial Gold Enzymes Using a Genetically Encoded Thiophenol&#8208;Based Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Binding Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of artificial metalloenzymes containing genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding sites featuring a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, which serves as an excellent soft ligand for binding various noble metals, was developed. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised, confirming gold binding to the thiophenol, and successfully applied in catalytic hydroamination reactions.







Abstract
Incorporating noble metals in artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is challenging due to the lack of suitable soft coordinating ligands among natural amino acids. We present a new class of ArMs featuring a genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding site based on a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, 4&#8208;mercaptophenylalanine (pSHF), incorporated in the transcriptional regulator LmrR through stop codon suppression. We demonstrate that pSHF is an excellent ligand for noble metals in their low oxidation states. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and successfully catalysed hydroamination reactions of 2&#8208;ethynyl anilines with turnover numbers over 50. Interestingly, two equivalents of gold(I) per protein dimer proved to be required for activity. Up to 98&#8201;% regioselectivity in the hydroamination of an ethynylphenylurea substrate was observed, yielding the corresponding phenyl&#8208;dihydroquinazolinone product, consistent with a &#960;&#8208;activation mechanism by single gold centres. The ArM was optimized by site saturation mutagenesis using an on&#8208;bead screening protocol. This resulted in a single mutant that showed higher activity for one class of substrates. This work brings the power of noble&#8208;metal catalysis into the realm of enzyme engineering and establishes thiophenols as alternative ligands for noble metals, providing new opportunities in coordination chemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;Compatible Supercapacitor&#8208;Diode Empowering Computation Efficiency for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode, the reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) and corresponding computing blocks effectively mimic the biological system: Unidirectional ion flow is mimicked based on the significant capacitance difference; Dendritic computing is mimicked based on the tunable ion rectification; Neuromorphic computing is mimicked based on the volatile/nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage.







Abstract
Biological system utilizes unidirectional ion flow to produce and transmit signals. To realize bioinspired artificial intelligence and thus seamless human&#8208;machine interaction, ion rectification devices should be developed. Here, a reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) is developed by resettling the pseudo&#8208;capacitive and electrochemical&#8208;double&#8208;layer&#8208;capacitive components of a lithium&#8208;ion pseudocapacitor into the positive and negative voltage regions respectively through engineering the redox peaks. This CAPode exhibits good ion rectification and charge&#8208;storage bifunction with high rectification ratio (RR) (RRI~20, RRII~0.83), large areal capacitance (17&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long cycling stability (5000 cycles). More importantly, two main computing paradigms in the biological system are efficiently realized based on this CAPode by empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode: (I) multivalued ionic logic gates are constructed based on the tunable ion rectification characteristics induced by the bifunction of this CAPode for mimicking the dendritic computing; (II) all&#8208;CAPode based reservoir computing is implemented based on the reconfigurable volatile and nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage characteristics of this CAPode for mimicking the neuromorphic computing. This work paves a new way towards seamless and high&#8208;efficiency human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Mn Doping at High&#8208;Activity Octahedral Vacancies of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysis in Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8722;Fe2O3/CNT catalyst was synthesized by doping Mn into the highly active octahedral sites, and displays efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance for ORR and Metal&#8208;air batteries. The strong electron donating capability of octahedral sites and synergistic effect between Mn and Fe optimized reaction energy barriers, and the vacancies in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 located only at octahedral sites were confirmed by the clarification doping sites of Mn.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 with the intrinsic cation vacancies is an ideal substrate for heteroatom doping into the highly active octahedral sites in spinel oxide catalysts. However, it is still a challenge to confirm the vacancy location of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 through experiments and obtain enhanced catalytic performance by preferential occupation of octahedral sites for heteroatom doping. Here, a Mn&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 incorporated with carbon nanotubes catalyst was developed to successfully achieve preferential doping into highly active octahedral sites by employing &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 as the precursor. Further, the vacancy in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 was only located on octahedral sites rather than tetrahedral ones, which was first proved by direct experimental evidence through the clarification doping sites of Mn. Notably, the catalyst shows outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82&#8197;V and 0.64&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as the maximum power density of 179 mWcm&#8722;2 and 403 mWcm&#8722;2 for Mg&#8208;air batteries and Al&#8208;air batteries, respectively. It could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the doping Mn on octahedral sites and the substrate &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 along with the modification of the adsorption/desorption properties for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates as well as the optimization of the reaction energy barriers.

A fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) Scheme is introduced for precise quantification of individual interactions within complex molecular systems. Applications across diverse fields, encompassing protein&#8208;ligand binding energies and association energies in large biomolecular assemblies, showcase the versatility and broad applicability of this approach.







Abstract
We introduce the fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) scheme for precise quantification of individual interactions contributing to the binding energy of arbitrary chemical entities, such as protein&#8208;ligand binding energies, lattice energies of molecular crystals, or association energies of large biomolecular assemblies. Using fp&#8208;LED, we can assess whether the contribution to the binding energy arising from noncovalent interactions between pairs of molecular fragments in any chemical system is attractive or repulsive, and accurately quantify its magnitude at the coupled cluster level &#8208; commonly considered as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of computational chemistry. Such insights are crucial for advancing molecular and material design strategies in fields like catalysis and therapeutic development. Illustrative applications across diverse fields demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of this theoretical framework, promising profound implications for fundamental understanding and practical applications.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Enables RNA Aptamers to Function as Sensors for Reactive Inorganic Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activity&#8208;based light&#8208;up aptamer system was developed to enable a single RNA aptamer to detect non&#8208;fluorogenic and reactive inorganics. This method can easily turn E. coli into whole&#8208;cell sensors of redox species. Organic chemistry principles can advance aptamers by expanding their target scope without nucleic acid engineering or in vitro selection.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer (FLAP) systems are promising (bio)sensing platforms that are genetically encodable. However, FLAP&#8208;mediated detection of each distinct target necessitates either in vitro selection or engineering of nucleic acid sequences. Furthermore, an aptamer that binds an inorganic target or a chemical species with a short lifetime is challenging to realize. Here, we describe a small&#8208;molecule approach that makes it possible for a single FLAP system to detect chemically unique, non&#8208;fluorogenic, and reactive inorganics. We developed functionalized pre&#8208;ligands of RNA aptamers that bind benzylidene imidazolinones (Baby Spinach, Broccolli, Squash). Reactive inorganics, hydrogen sulfide (H2S/HS&#8722;) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can specifically convert these pre&#8208;ligands into native ligands that fluoresce with FLAPs. Adaptation of this platform to live cells opened an opportunity for constructing whole&#8208;cell sensors: Escherichia coli transformed with a Baby Spinach&#8208;encoding plasmid and incubated with pre&#8208;ligands generated fluorescence in response to exogenous H2S/HS&#8722; or H2O2. Leveraging the functional group reactivity of small molecules eliminates the requirement of in vitro selection of a new aptamer sequence or oligonucleotide scaffold engineering for distinct molecular targets. Our method allows for detecting inorganic, short&#8208;lived species, thereby advancing FLAP systems beyond their current capabilities.

         <title>Isomerization&#8208;Controlled Aggregation in Photoactive Layer: An Additive Strategy for Organic Solar Cells with Over 19.5&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric molecules are employed as additives in organic photovoltaics. Stepwise regulations of acceptor aggregation are realized. Liquid additive LCB retards solvent evaporation, preventing excessive aggregation. Solid additive SCB shortens aggregation period, obtaining tight molecular stacking. While volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes intermolecular interactions, achieving optimal molecular aggregation, which lead to significant efficiency enhancement of PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices up to 19.51%







Abstract
Morphology control of the photoactive layer is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), yet it remains a significant challenge in this field. One effective approach is the additive strategy, which fine&#8208;tunes the morphology of the photoactive layer. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the impact of different types of additives from liquid, solid, to volatile solid, on the bulk heterojunction morphology and device performance are not fully understood. Herein, we present an aggregation regulation strategy for acceptor molecules by incorporating three novel isomeric additives: 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene (LCB), 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (SCB), and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (VCB) into the blend active layer. This approach optimizes the bulk heterojunction morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Our results reveal that these additives induce stepwise regulation of acceptor molecule aggregation during film formation. The liquid additive LCB primarily extends solvent evaporation time, effectively preventing excessive aggregation, while the solid additive SCB significantly shortens the aggregation period during the film evolution, resulting in the most compact molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Furthermore, the volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes the intermolecular interactions and crystallization within the active layer, promoting optimal molecular self&#8208;assembly and aggregation for ideal molecular stacking. Consequently, the power conversion efficiencies of 19.33&#8201;% and 19.51&#8201;% were achieved for the VCB&#8208;processed D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208; and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs, respectively, outperforming the LCB&#8208;processed and SCB&#8208;processed devices.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminophore Switches Photodynamic Processes via Protein Complexation for Biomarker&#8208;Activatable Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

Near&#8208;infrared Type&#8208;I photodynamic chemiluminescent&#8208;protein complex (HEDPN) is designed which can be specifically activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed nitroreductase for chemiluminescence&#8208;guided PDT.







Abstract
Despite the potential in cancer therapy, phototheranostic agents often face two challenges: limited diagnostic sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy due to the Type&#8208;II photodynamic process with the heavy oxygen reliance. In contrast, chemiluminescent theranostic agents without the requirement of real&#8208;time light excitation can address the issue of tissue autofluorescence, which however have been rarely reported for photodynamic therapy (PDT), not to mention less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type&#8208;I PDT. In this work, we synthesize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores with the specific binding towards human serum albumin (HSA) to form chemiluminophore&#8208;protein complex for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy. Interestingly, after the complexation with HSA, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensities of chemiluminophores are enhanced by over 10&#8208;fold; meanwhile, the photodynamic process switches from Type&#8208;II (singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation dominated) to Type&#8208;I (superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical dominated), while the previously reported activated chemiluminophore with non&#8208;specific HSA binding can't switch photodynamic process. Based on the optimal chemiluminophore, a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable CL probe&#8208;protein complex is synthesized, which specially turns on its CL and Type&#8208;I PDT in hypoxic tumors for precision therapy. Thus, this study provides a complexation strategy to improve phototheranostic performance of chemiluminophores.

Replacing an ester by an ether function in the side chain of a chiral benzene1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer (magenta and red disks, resp.) greatly favours its copolymerization with achiral BTA monomers (green disk), due to the minimization of competing species. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit greater stability which translates into better catalytic and rheological properties.







Abstract
Improving the stability of multi&#8208;component and functional assemblies such as supramolecular copolymers without impeding their dynamicity is key for their implementation as innovative materials. Up to now, this has been achieved by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, requiring the time&#8208;consuming characterization of a series of supramolecular coassemblies. We report herein that this is possible to significantly enhance the stability of supramolecular copolymers by a minimal change in the chemical nature of one of the interacting monomers. This is achieved by replacing an ester function by an ether function in the structure of a chiral benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, used as &#8220;sergeant&#8221;, coassembled with achiral monomers, the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;. Pseudo&#8208;phase diagrams, constructed by probing the nature of the coassemblies with multifarious analytical techniques, confirm that the greater stability of the resulting copolymers is mainly due to the minimization of competing species. This leads to better rheological and catalytic properties of the corresponding supramolecular copolymers. Favouring coassembly over undesired assembly pathways must be considered as a blueprint for the development of better&#8208;performing supramolecular multi&#8208;component systems.

         <title>A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Radical Emission System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems have been built by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. The ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer and ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer effects between metal compounds and organic radicals endow these systems&#8217; multi&#8208;band and multiple stimulus&#8208;response emissions. In addition, such materials have been used to detect radioactive metal ions.







Abstract
Developing new organic radical emission systems and regulating their luminescence properties presents a significant challenge. Herein, we build dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. After the assembling, dual&#8208;band, and excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission was observed upon ultraviolet light irradiation, one emission band originates from carbonyl radical after light irradiation, the other band from the ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which benefits from the charge transfer from the radicals to the metal salts. The dual emission centers also introduce excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties for the molecules. In addition, three&#8208;band emission covering the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions can be shown when two or three kinds of metal ions are simultaneously doped into the radical system driven by the ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT). Interestingly, visible light can quickly quench the radical emission of systems, thus realizing a dynamic luminescence. The LMMCT effect and strong supramolecular interactions significantly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by up to 67.2&#8201;%. Moreover, such materials can be successfully used for detecting radioactive metal ions and information encryption. This study develops a platform for manufacturing various metal&#8208;organic radical emission systems with diverse properties.

         <title>Conditional Relay Activation of Theranostic Prodrug by Pretargeting Bioorthogonal Trigger and Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We devise a click&#8208;photo&#8208;activatable theranostic prodrug platform exemplified by tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;conjugated SN&#8208;38 prodrug 1 with masked fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an IEDDA reaction between the tetrazine unit on the prodrug and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) on the tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation to liberate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells.







Abstract
Bioorthogonalized light&#8208;responsive click&#8208;and&#8208;uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on&#8208;target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload in situ. The proof of concept for such &#8220;light where is lit up&#8221;&#8208;activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY conjugated SN&#8208;38 (1) with masked fluorescence, up to 70&#8197;times&#8208;reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on 1 and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500&#8211;520&#8197;nm) to activate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Fused vs 575&#8208;Ringed Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Selective Synthesis, Reactivity and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Scholl reaction has been used for the selective synthesis of two different boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems: an unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization as well as the desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The two products have fully distinct chemical reactivities, electronic structures, and photophysical properties.







Abstract
Incorporation of heteroatoms and/or non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can alter their intrinsic structures and physical properties. However, it is challenging to construct PAHs featuring boron/carbon composition and non&#8208;hexagonal combination. Herein, we disclose the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;type and pentagon/heptagon&#8208;containing boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems by the Scholl reaction. Two spiro&#8208;fused organoboranes 1 and 2 and one 575&#8208;ringed boron&#8208;doped nanographene 3 were synthesized. The key point is that the boron&#8208;edged &#960;&#8208;system enabled unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization, whereas the boron&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;system enabled desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The thus&#8208;obtained molecules exhibit the intriguing but fully distinct reactivity, electronic structures and properties, for instance, while 2 may react with Br&#248;nsted acid to display reversible chemochromism and further convert into 1, 3 possesses very broad absorption, short excited&#8208;state lifetime and no fluorescence nature. As disclosed, the boron atom together with the spirocycle region or 575&#8208;ringed structural motif significantly contribute to their characteristic properties. Thus, this study sheds light on control over the Scholl reaction using organoborane &#960;&#8208;systems and will promote the exploration of more sophisticated polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems as organic reactive and optical scaffolds.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Control of Mammalian Gene Expression Using DNA Repair Inducible Ribozyme Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch based on site&#8208;specific DNA lesion&#8208;modified plasmids was designed for cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression. This strategy was demonstrated to allow selective control the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing in cancer cells, providing a compact system for DNA repair monitoring and precision gene therapy.







Abstract
The ability to control gene expression is vital for elucidating gene functions and developing next&#8208;generation therapeutics. Current techniques are challenged by the lack of cell&#8208;specific control designs or immunogenicity risk from foreign proteins. We develop a DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch that enables cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression in cells and in vivo. This strategy designs plasmids with a DNA lesion (8&#8208;oxoG and O6&#8208;MeG) site&#8208;specifically installed within the ribozyme encoding region, generating active hammerhead ribozyme for mRNA degradation due to transcriptional mutagenesis, whereas DNA repair yields a single&#8208;base mismatch in the ribozyme to abrogate its activity. This strategy is demonstrated to allow specific control of gene expression in cancer cells with overexpressed DNA repair enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and O6&#8208;methylguanine&#8208;DNA&#8208;methyltransferases.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to control gene expression is vital for elucidating gene functions and developing next-generation therapeutics. Current techniques are challenged by the lack of cell-specific control designs or immunogenicity risk from foreign proteins. We develop a DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch that enables cell-specific control of gene expression in cells and in vivo. This strategy designs plasmids with a DNA lesion (8-oxoG and O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-MeG) site-specifically installed within the ribozyme encoding region, generating active hammerhead ribozyme for mRNA degradation due to transcriptional mutagenesis, whereas DNA repair yields a single-base mismatch in the ribozyme to abrogate its activity. This strategy is demonstrated to allow specific control of gene expression in cancer cells with overexpressed DNA repair enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferases. It also shows the capability of conditionally regulating the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing, enabling DNA repair monitoring and targeted gene therapy in cancer cells. This strategy is demonstrated using the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for in vivo editing of oncogenic Polo-like kinase 1 in a mouse model, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression.

         <title>Molecular Conjugated&#8208;Polymer Electrode Enables Rapid Proton Conduction for Electrosynthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with copper catalyst is reported for selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The polyaniline in the electrode mediates proton transfer reactions involved in the process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility for molecular engineering of electrode supports to promote the selectivity and energy efficiency for NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrate (NO3&#8722;) using renewable energy holds promise as a supplementary alternative to the Haber&#8722;Bosch process for NH3 production. Most research focuses on tuning the catalytic activity of metal catalysts by modification of the catalyst structures. However, the electrode supports which could influence the catalytic activity have not been well&#8208;explored. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 still exhibit limited energy efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current density. Herein, we report a polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with Cu catalyst for selective and energy&#8208;efficient NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3. In the electrode, the polyaniline promotes protonation of the key intermediate formed during NO3&#8722; reduction at Cu, which circumvents the limitation of the Cu catalyst in the efficiency&#8208;limiting proton transfer step. The molecular electrode produces NH3 at a partial current density of 2.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an energy efficiency of 62&#8201;%, demonstrating much better electrochemical performance than common Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and indicating the great potential in molecular engineering of electrode supports for selective NO3&#8722; reduction.

         <title>Beyond Dimerization: Harnessing Tetrameric Coiled&#8208;Coils for Nanostructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

Introducing tetrameric coiled&#8208;coils into CCPO structures can improve their stability and expands the possible topologies that can be constructed. Assembling proteins from two units could be used as delivery systems, as their assembly could be controlled via external modulators. The first cryo&#8208;EM structure of a CCPO is presented.







Abstract
Versatile DNA and polypeptide&#8208;based structures have been designed based on complementary modules. However, polypeptides can also form higher oligomeric states. We investigated the introduction of tetrameric modules as a substitute for coiled&#8208;coil dimerization units used in previous modular nanostructures. Tetramerizing helical bundles can run in parallel or antiparallel orientation, expanding the number of topological solutions for modular nanostructures. Furthermore, this strategy facilitates the construction of nanostructures from two identical polypeptide chains. Importantly, tetrameric modules substantially stabilized protein nanostructures against air&#8211;water interface denaturation, enabling the determination of the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy three&#8208;dimensional structure of a coiled&#8208;coil&#8208;based nanostructure, confirming the designed agreement of the modules forming a tetrahedral cage.

         <title>Constraining CO2 Coverage on Copper Promotes CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products in Strong Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diluting CO2 feed enhances CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products on Cu in strong acid. Reduced CO2 coverage stabilizes intermediates such as *CO2 and *CO, while suppressing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation. Enriched CO surface coverage and optimized CO adsorption configuration, promote C&#8722;C coupling for C2+ production. This work addresses CO2 reactant loss and advances direct flue gas electrolysis for valuable chemicals and fuels.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C&#8722;C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C&#8722;C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C1 products. By employing a 20&#8201;% CO2 feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, approximately 1.7&#8197;times higher than the 41&#8201;% obtained using pure CO2. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30&#8201;% CO2 feed&#8212;representative CO2 concentration of typical industrial flue gases&#8212;in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C2+ selectivity of 78&#8201;% and an energy efficiency of 23&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Bulk Stereoselective Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers by the Coordination of ZrCl4 with Tunable Spirocyclic Phosphoric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective polymerization of vinyl ethers was achieved using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid, featuring low catalyst loads, solvent&#8208;free, high tacticity control, and recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
Control over stereochemistry in poly(vinyl ether)s leads to a notable change in their physical properties, yet remains a grand challenge. Here, we demonstrate the bulk stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid (SPA). The widely variable substituents in SPAs exert a profound impact on the stereochemical and activity outcome of the polymerization: the % m of poly(vinyl ether)s linearly increases with the Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) of SPAs; the catalytic activity increases with the &#963;; the large steric hindrance groups lead to decreased polymerization activity. Mechanism studies suggest that the coordination of ZrCl4 with three equivalents of SPAs generates the chiral complex. The complex can abstract chlorine from the initiator/chain end to form the chiral ion pair allowing the selective facial addition of incoming monomers. The catalyst system features characteristics of no solvent, low loads, high tacticity control, high monomer scope, and recyclability.

&lt;p&gt;The stereoselective polymerization of vinyl ethers was achieved using ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid, featuring low catalyst loads, solvent-free, high tacticity control, and recyclable catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control over stereochemistry in poly(vinyl ether)s leads to a notable change in their physical properties, yet remains a grand challenge. Here, we demonstrate the bulk stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers using ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid (SPA). The widely variable substituents in SPAs exert a profound impact on the stereochemical and activity outcome of the polymerization: the % &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; of poly(vinyl ether)s linearly increases with the Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) of SPAs; the catalytic activity increases with the &#963;; the large steric hindrance groups lead to decreased polymerization activity. Mechanism studies suggest that the coordination of ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with three equivalents of SPAs generates the chiral complex. The complex can abstract chlorine from the initiator/chain end to form the chiral ion pair allowing the selective facial addition of incoming monomers. The catalyst system features characteristics of no solvent, low loads, high tacticity control, high monomer scope, and recyclability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of arenesulfenyl fluorides (ArS&#8208;F) has been achieved via a Halex reaction. Several arenesulfenyl fluorides have been characterized by NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy, including structural analysis of two compounds by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group engages in direct, efficient, and highly regioselective&#160;anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes.







Abstract
Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8722;S&#8722;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8722;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Pt Nanowires with Disordered Shells for Highly Active Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt sub&#8208;nanometer nanowires, which feature a unique architecture with a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms surrounding a crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter, are succsessfully synthesized. It significantly boosts the electrochemical surface area and catalytic efficiency for formic acid oxidation, a key reaction in direct formic acid fuel cells, which have the potential to outperform current battery technologies for lightweight, long&#8208;lasting portable power.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional materials at atomic&#8208;scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small&#8208;molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long&#8208;chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub&#8208;nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface composed of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface&#8208;area of 189&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous&#8208;like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1, surpassing most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire&#8208;structures at sub&#8208;nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Diffusion and Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film via Reducing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing formic acid (FA) as cationic solvent retards reaction rate and stabilizes I&#8722;, while further introduction of dithiothreitol (DTT) precisely modulates reaction&#8208;diffusion and crystallization kinetics through establishing a targeted interaction with SnI2, thus obtaining high&#8208;quality perovskite film and highlighting the importance of kinetic balance. Ultimately, the DTT&#8208;incorporated device delivers the highest PCE of 12.68&#8201;% in a DMSO&#8208;free solvent by the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step deposition method effectively mitigates the efficiency decline observed in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPVSCs) with increasing cell area, stemming from film in&#8208;homogeneity. However, the high solubility of SnI2 in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction&#8208;diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second&#8208;step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction&#8208;diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8722;1.38 to &#8722;10.10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between ligands and Sn2+ significantly enhances the effectiveness of two&#8208;step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large&#8208;scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68&#8201;% for 0.04&#8197;cm2 device and 11.30&#8201;% for 1&#8197;cm2 device among tin&#8208;based perovskite devices in two&#8208;step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study lays the groundwork for the potential scale&#8208;up development of lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Divergent Oxidation Reactions of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Allylic Primary Alcohols by an Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

The unspecific peroxygenase rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and aldehyde/acid products, respectively. Both reactions were performed on a preparative scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic substrates using only hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant. The PaDa&#8722;I variant of the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform E/Z mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram&#8208;scale transformation. These reactions provide further evidence for the potential of UPOs as catalysts for the scalable preparation of important oxygenated intermediates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic substrates using only hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant. The PaDa&#8722;I variant of the UPO from &lt;i&gt;Agrocybe aegerita&lt;/i&gt; catalyses the oxidation of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram-scale transformation. These reactions provide further evidence for the potential of UPOs as catalysts for the scalable preparation of important oxygenated intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Through Space &#960;&#8208;Electrons Communication in [2,2]&#8208;Paracyclophanes: Unprecendented Stabilization of Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D spatial configuration of paracyclophanes lowers the activation energy for alkoxyamine to afford stabilized radicals. This family of new compounds is able to initiate nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization and also exhibits antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines.







Abstract
Efforts to understand radical stability have led to considerable progress in radical chemistry. In this article, we investigated a novel approach to enhancing the radical stability of carbon&#8208;centered radicals through space electron delocalization within [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes. Alkoxyamines possessing a paracyclophane scaffold exploit face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interactions between the aromatic rings to effectively lower bond dissociation energy (BDE) for NO&#8722;C bond homolysis. Electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments and computational modeling have confirmed a better stability compared to the analogues without the paracyclophane core. Theoretical analyses further elucidate the role of through&#8208;space electron communication in enhancing radical stability. This study highlights promising applications in fields such as organic synthesis, material science, and drug design. By achieving a low BDE for homolysis, the alkoxyamines efficiently release radicals, enabling successful application in nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP) of styrene, which provides high control over polymer architecture. Additionally, preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative assays reveal that the alkoxyamines exhibit promising anti&#8208;cancer activities against lung, breast, and prostate cells, which is correlated to their ability to release radicals upon homolysis.

         <title>Latent Solvent&#8208;Induced Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interfacial Chemistry to Achieve Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed into low&#8208;concentration electrolyte to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath. The designed electrolyte exhibits enhanced oxidation resistance, low desolvation energy, and highly stable SEI film with superior potassium storage performances.







Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) have attracted great attention due to their cost effectiveness and low viscosity, but suffer undesired organic&#8208;rich interfacial chemistry and poor oxidative stability. Herein, a unique latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath and construct a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interface in a 0.5&#8197;M electrolyte. This unique solvation structure reduces the desolvation energy, facilitating rapid interfacial kinetics and K+ intercalation in graphite. Additionally, enhanced anion&#8208;cation interactions promote the formation of a thin and robust interfacial layer with excellent cycling performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Graphite||perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride full cell exhibits a good capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, and delivers a high discharge capacity of 131.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of latent solvent&#8208;optimized electrolyte engineering, providing a pathway of superior electrochemical energy storage in PIBs.

         <title>Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Incorporating 4,5&#8208;Dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene Cores</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel class of extended tetrathiafulvalenes incorporating a dihydro&#8208;azulenoazulene core is presented. Upon oxidation to the dication, a non&#8208;benzenoid, aromatic core is obtained as corroborated by DFT computations, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR/EPR spectroelectrochemistry, and X&#8208;ray as well as electron diffraction studies. The redox and optical properties are finely tuned by ring fusion (benzene, naphthalene or thiophene) at the azulenoazulene core.







Abstract
The introduction of 4,5&#8208;dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene as a central core between two 1,4&#8208;dithiafulvene (DTF) units provides a novel class of extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) electron donors. Herein we present the synthesis of such compounds with the azulenoazulene further expanded by annulation to benzene, naphthalene, or thiophene rings. Moreover, unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with one DTF and one carbonyl at the central core are presented. The effect of the odd&#8208;membered rings of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cores on the geometrical features and the extent of bond conjugation in these systems were investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemical studies, X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, and computational studies. Altogether these studies reveal that, upon oxidation, the non&#8208;planar core of the bis(benzo)&#8208;fused dihydro&#8208;azulenoazulene&#8208;extended TTF generates a large 22&#960;&#8208;aromatic system (together with two 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,3&#8208;dithiolium appendages) characterized by significant bond length equalizations. The dication formed by oxidation is EPR silent, indicating a singlet ground state. Computations reveal that the closed&#8208;shell singlet species and its open&#8208;shell singlet counterpart are nearly degenerate and of lower energy than a triplet species. According to cyclic voltammetry, the compounds can be oxidized further and present multi&#8208;redox systems.

         <title>Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the potential of DESs for practical applications, we propose a novel competition coordination strategy for designing the ternary DESs, which can reinforce the construction of H&#8208;bond interaction and facilitate the exsolution of the ligand (OxA), leading to an enhanced mass transfer kinetic and an excellent selective precipitation of metals (Ni).







Abstract
The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal&#8208;oxygen (MO6) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8211;liquid ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5&#8201;% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals&#8208;oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing&#8208;ligand (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36&#8201;% to 17.76&#8201;% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O product (~95.7&#8201;% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation and growth kinetics of COFs are regulated using the temperature&#8208;swing synthesis strategy, which contributes to highly crystalline and porous COF films. The regular channels within the COF enable fast solvent permeation and excellent selectivity to precisely discriminate fine antibiotic mixtures. This work paves the way towards the structural orderliness of framework materials.







Abstract
Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 79&#8197;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is 4.5 times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Process for the Regiodivergent Double Hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene produced either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile with high regioselectivity. The success of this process is attributed to the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which create a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center.







Abstract
In industry, the two important nitrile starting materials, adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile, are primarily manufactured through the well&#8208;known DuPont process, which consists of a tandem sequence including first hydrocyanation, isomerization and second hydrocyanation. However, this mature process has the intrinsic defects of step efficiency and regioselectivity. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to produce either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile in high regioselectivity. The key to this success lies in the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which creates a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center. The first hydrocyanation that produces either the linear or branched alkenyl nitrile was identified as the selectivity&#8208;determining step. Organometallic studies confirm the formation of well&#8208;defined diphosphite nickel diene complexes in solution, and the role of ligands in dictating regioselectivity was further rationalized by DFT computations. This result provides the first example of a highly selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile from butadiene, and it also represents a high&#8208;level of catalyst&#8208;controlled regioselectivity via the fine&#8208;tuning of ligand pocket geometry.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolytes with High Disordered Solvation Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;concentration HE electrolyte is developed to address dendrite formation and side reactions in aqueous ZIBs. This HE electrolyte features weakly solvated structures and multiple anions, leading to highly disordered solvation shells that enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics and electrode interface stability. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetric cells reach over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling, and Zn||Cu cells achieve 99.9&#8201;% CE over 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are playing an increasingly important role in the field of energy storage owing to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical applications are still handicapped by severe dendrite formation and side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion) on the zinc anodes. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration high&#8208;entropy (HE) electrolyte strategy is proposed to achieve high reversibility and ultra&#8208;durable zinc metal anode. Specifically, this HE electrolyte features multiple anions participating in coordination and highly disordered solvation shells, which would disrupt the intrinsic H&#8208;bond network between water molecules and suppress interfacial side reactions. Moreover, these diversified weakly solvated structures can lower the solvation energy of Zn2+ solvation configurations and enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics, thereby promoting uniform Zn deposition and electrode interface stability. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells exhibit over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling stability, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells achieve a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn||PANI full cell with the optimized HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity of 110.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 70.4&#8201;% at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte still demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;%. This research provides a promising strategy for the design of aqueous electrolytes, aiding in the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Zeolite Encapsulation to Enhance Interfacial Gas Availability for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulating the photocatalyst within S&#8208;1 zeolite efficiently enriched gaseous oxygen and accelerated the photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 by creating a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface, which significantly increased the concentration of gaseous oxygen in the microporous structure of zeolite and facilitated its interaction with the surface of the photocatalyst at the liquid&#8208;solid interface.







Abstract
The photocatalytic oxidation of water with gaseous oxygen is environmentally benign for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but it is currently constrained by the inadequate supply of gaseous oxygen at the catalyst surface in a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase reaction system. Herein, we address this challenge by employing the zeolite encapsulated catalysts that efficiently enrich gaseous oxygen and accelerate the H2O2 synthesis in aqueous conditions. We focus on the classical titania photocatalyst, encapsulating it within siliceous MFI zeolite crystals. This encapsulation results in a significant enhancement in H2O2 synthesis efficiency, achieving a yield that is ten times greater than that with unencapsulated TiO2. Mechanism study reveals that gaseous oxygen is notably concentrated within the microporous structure of the zeolite under aqueous conditions, thereby facilitating its interaction with the titania surface at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. In addition, the H2O2 product could swiftly transfer through the micropores, thereby reducing the side reaction of decomposition. This design provides an alternative pathway to address the poor gas solubility of gaseous reactants in water, and paves the way for advancements in various other photocatalytic processes.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships for s&#8208;Block Metal/Co(III) Heterodinuclear Catalysts in Cyclohexene Oxide Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear catalysts featuring Co(III) in combination with s&#8208;block metals are reported for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide with phthalic anhydride, and with carbon dioxide at 20 and 1&#8197;bar pressures. Quantifiable structure&#8211;activity trends are observed; activity increases with decreasing s&#8208;block metal Lewis acidity, as measured by the pKa of the s&#8208;block metal aqua complexes. These relationships reveal key mechanistic insights to help inform future catalyst design.







Abstract
In homogeneous catalysis, uncovering structure&#8211;activity relationships remains very rare but invaluable to understand and rationally improve performances. Here, generalizable structure&#8211;activity relationships apply to a series of heterodinuclear polymerization catalysts featuring Co(III) and s&#8208;block metals M(I/II) (M=Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Sr(II), Ba(II)). These are shown to apply to polycarbonate production by the ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), conducted at high (20&#8197;bar) and low (1&#8197;bar) CO2 pressures, and to polyester production by copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and phthalic anhydride (PA). For the CHO/PA and high&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerizations, activity increases exponentially with s&#8208;block metal acidity peaking at the Co(III)K(I) catalyst, whilst for the low&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerization it increases linearly to the same metal combination. The polymerization kinetics fit second order rate laws and the correlations support dinuclear metallate mechanistic hypotheses. These relationships help understand and identify key metal complex structural features in synergic polymerization catalysis.

         <title>Arraying and Guest Inclusion of Soluble Metal&#8208;Organic Nanotubes Composed of Macrocyclic Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular and square metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were constructed based on paddlewheel Rh dimer complexes. The side chains introduced into the metal complexes allowed the nanotubes to dissolve in solutions. The nanotubes were cast on a substrate to form a solid film oriented over a wide area. In addition, the nanotubes encapsulated guest molecules.







Abstract
A new series of metal&#8208;organic nanotubes was constructed through one&#8208;dimensional assembly using molecular triangles or molecular squares composed of paddlewheel dirhodium complexes and bidentate axial ligands. The metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were significantly different from conventional solid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) motifs. They exhibit good solubility owing to the branched side chains at their periphery and demonstrate high orientation capabilities in thin films owing to their anisotropic structure. Furthermore, the nanotubes can accommodate guest molecules in nanochannels and orient them on a large scale on a glass substrate.

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Mediated Helical Chirality in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of chiral organic ammonium ion are arranged alternatively in the structure of 2D hybrid perovskites. The two conformers have very different strengths of non&#8208;covalent interactions at the organic&#8211;inorganic interface. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions induces the rare helical chirality within the inorganic sublattice with interesting chiroptic properties. This conformer&#8208;mediated chirality is a novel concept.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral hybrid perovskites A2PbI4 (A: chiral organic ion) enable chirality controlled optoelectronic and spin&#8208;based properties. A+ organic sublattice induces chirality into the semiconducting [PbI4]2&#8722; inorganic sublattice through non&#8208;covalent interactions at organic&#8211;inorganic interface. Often, the A+ cations in the lattice have different orientations, leading to asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions. In a novel approach, we use different conformers of A+ cations to create asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions, thereby, achieving chiral perovskites with rare helical enantiomorphic structures. We prepared (R&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 and (S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 (IdPA: 1&#8208;iodopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ammonium) which crystallize in the helical enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of IdPA+ are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, the anti&#8208;conformer of IdPA+ ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonding, and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding interactions with the [PbI4]2&#8722; sublattice, compared to the gauche&#8208;conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions caused by the alternative arrangement of gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers induces chirality in the inorganic sublattice with four&#8208;fold screw axes (43 and 41). The enantiomers (R&#8208;/S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 show mirror&#8208;image like circular dichroism from excitonic absorption of the inorganic sublattice. This conformer&#8208;based design of chiral hybrid perovskites in helical space groups broadens material choices for advanced optoelectronic applications.

A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet displays reversible redox transformation upon ultraviolet irradiation and subsequent dark treatment, leading to a significant change of magnetic memory effect.







Abstract
A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5](PMo12O40)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CyPh2PO&#8901;H2O (1&#8208;Dy) is synthesized via cocrystal engineering of a polyoxomolybdate (POMo) anion and an Ising&#8208;type cation with pseudo pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Upon ultraviolet irradiation, MoVI&#8208;to&#8208;MoV single&#8208;electron photoreduction occurs in the POMo moiety, resulting in significant changes of optical and magnetic properties. The emergence of intervalence charge&#8208;transfer transitions in heteropoly blue state 1&#8208;Dy* facilitates photothermal conversion in near&#8208;infrared region. Meanwhile, the coercive field of hysteresis loop is altered from 0.72&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy) to 0.04&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy*) at 2&#8197;K, which might be contributed to the magnetic interaction between DyIII and MoV. After dark treatment, 1&#8208;Dy* can convert to the initial state with the recovery of magnetic memory effect. These results presented herein provide a blueprint for developing versatile opto&#8208;magnetic materials via the coupling of photochemical regulation and magnetic interaction.

Coordinative pyridyl units are introduced as side&#8208;chains on poly&#8208;triarylamine (PTAA) backbone with varied contents by copolymerization method, resulting in chemical interactions between polymeric HTMs and substrates. The strong interaction allows them to be processed into ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and robust hole&#8208;transporting layers, greatly decreasing charge transport losses. Based on the optimal CP4, we achieved highly efficient inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 26.21&#8201;%.







Abstract
Currently, the development of polymeric hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) lags behind that of small&#8208;molecule HTMs in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A critical challenge is that conventional polymeric HTMs are incapable of forming ultra&#8208;thin and conformal coatings like self&#8208;assembly monolayers (SAMs), especially for substrates with rough surface morphology. Herein, we address this challenge by designing anchorable polymeric HTMs (CP1 to CP5). Specifically, coordinative pyridyl groups are introduced as side&#8208;chains on poly&#8208;triarylamine (PTAA) backbone with varied contents by copolymerization method, resulting in chemical interactions between polymeric HTMs and substrates. The strong interaction allows them to be processed into ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and robust hole&#8208;transporting layers through employing low&#8208;concentration solutions (0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1, vs. 2.0&#8211;5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for conventional PTAA), greatly decreasing charge transport losses. Moreover, upon systematically tuning the pyridyl substitution ratio, the energy levels, surface wetting, solution processability, and defect passivation capability of such anchorable HTMs are simultaneously optimized. Based on the optimal CP4, we achieved highly efficient inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 26.21&#8201;%, which is on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SAM&#8208;based inverted PSCs. Furthermore, these devices exhibit enhanced stabilities under repeated current&#8211;voltage scans and reverse bias ageing compared with SAM&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Striking Impact of Solvent Polarity on the Strength of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes: A Nexus Between Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional belief that the stability of H&#8208;bonded complexes decreases in a more polar solvent is being questioned in this study. Our analysis indicates that the stability of neutral H&#8208;bonded complexes increases in a more polar solvent, provided there is substantial charge transfer between the subsystems. Experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro&#8208;solvation and periodic metadynamics methods confirm the findings.







Abstract
The binding free energy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes is generally inversely proportional to the solvent dielectric constant. This occurs because the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the complex is always smaller than that of the individual subsystems, leading to a reduction in solvation energy. The present study explores the potential for stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes in a solvent with higher polarity. Contrary to the established understanding, we have demonstrated that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex (CH3CH2COOH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine) can be better stabilized in a solvent with higher polarity. In this case, a significant charge transfer between the subsystems results in an increased dipole moment of the complex, leading to its stabilization in a more polar solvent. The expected inverse relationship between binding free energy and solvent dielectric constant is observed when the charge transfer between the subsystems is low. Thus, the magnitude of the charge transfer between subsystems is possibly the key factor in determining the stabilization or destabilization of H&#8208;bonded complexes in different solvents. Here, we present a comprehensive study that combines experimental and theoretical approaches, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations to validate the findings.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired MXene&#8208;Integrated Mechanochromic Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Visible&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Radar Multispectral Camouflage</title>

         <dc:description>
Cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability exhibit dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching. Advanced pneumatically driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models demonstrate visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states.







Abstract
Multispectral camouflage materials that provide adaptable features across a wide spectrum, from visible light to radar frequencies, play a vital role in sophisticated multi&#8208;band electromagnetic (EM) applications. However, conventional single&#8208;band stealth is difficult to align with the growing demand for multi&#8208;band compatibility and intelligent adaptation. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability, which was fabricated through in situ thiol&#8208;acrylate Michael addition and free&#8208;radical photopolymerization of CLCE precursor and isocyanate&#8208;mediated robust covalent chemical bonding of MXene nanocoating at the interface. The resulting MXene&#8208;CLCE exhibits dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching, with its infrared stealth and microwave shielding properties being realized through the reconfiguration of surface morphology from planar to cracked states via mechanical actuation. A visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared camouflage octopus&#8208;patterned MXene&#8208;CLCE is demonstrated to achieve a stealth effect across the visible&#8208;infrared spectrum upon mechanical stretching. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pneumatic&#8208;driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models are demonstrated, which enables dynamic visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states. The research herein can offer new perspectives on the development of bioinspired smart camouflage materials and their application in various emerging fields such as smart optical stealth, dynamic thermal management, and switchable electromagnetic devices.

         <title>Exogenously and Endogenously Sequential Regulation of DNA Nanodevices Enables Organelle&#8208;Specific Signal Amplification in Subcellular ATP Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating exogenous NIR light&#8208;triggered photoactivation and endogenous enzyme&#8208;mediated signal amplification with DNA sensor technology, spatiotemporally selective, amplified imaging of ATP in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum is achieved. The dual&#8208;regulated nanodevices enable monitoring of ATP fluctuations in the specific organelles following drug intervention.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency in cells, is dynamically regulated across different subcellular compartments. The ATP interplay between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) underscores their coordinated roles in various biochemical processes, highlighting the necessity for precise profiling of subcellular ATP dynamics. Here we present an exogenously and endogenously dual&#8208;regulated DNA nanodevice for spatiotemporally selective, subcellular&#8208;compartment specific signal amplification in ATP sensing. The system allows for exogenous NIR light&#8208;controlled spatiotemporal localization and activation of the aptamer sensor in mitochondria or ER, while a specific endogenous enzyme in the organelles further drives signal amplification via the consumption of molecular beacon fuels, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivity and spatial precision for the subcellular ATP profiling in the organelle of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system for robust monitoring of ATP fluctuations in mitochondria and ER following drug interventions. This advancement provides a powerful tool for improving our understanding of cellular energetics at the subcellular level and holds potential for the development of targeted therapeutics.

         <title>Supercritical Ethane Processing of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes towards Pressure&#8208;Resistant C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneered the preparation of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes using supercritical ethane as solvent. Owing to its high diffusivity, low viscosity, and chemical inertness, grain boundary defects could be largely eliminated, resulting in superior and pressure&#8208;resistant C3H6/C3H8 separation performances.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have shown great promise in industrial&#8208;scale C3H6/C3H8 separation. Nonetheless, sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes remains a grand challenge. In this study, we pioneered the use of supercritical ethane (scC2H6) as reaction medium for preparing pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Membrane growth in neutral organic environment was proven to have less disturbance to structure integrity compared with supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Gas permeation results indicated that obtained ZIF&#8208;8 membrane exhibited an ideal C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 172.1 with C3H6 permeance of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pa&#8722;1. Of particular note, the membrane maintained stable C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of ~150 with C3H6 flux of ~1.6&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 at operation pressure of 6&#8197;bar, which was significantly different from ZIF&#8208;8 membranes obtained from scCO2 reaction medium. Through combining with advantages of zero pollutant discharge and full ligand recovery, our protocol holds great promise in sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes towards practical application in high&#8208;purity C3H6 production.

&lt;p&gt;We pioneered the preparation of ZIF-8 membranes using supercritical ethane as solvent. Owing to its high diffusivity, low viscosity, and chemical inertness, grain boundary defects could be largely eliminated, resulting in superior and pressure-resistant C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; separation performances.

&lt;p&gt;ZIF-8 membranes have shown great promise in industrial-scale C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; separation.

         <title>Catalytic Reductive Amination and Tandem Amination&#8211;Alkylation of Esters Enabled by a Cationic Iridium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation&#8208;enabled one&#8208;pot reductive amination and reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of common carboxylic esters to form N&#8208;alkylated, and tandem N&#8208;alkylated, &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines are described. The reactions relies on cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF, which exhibited high efficiency (at 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ir&#8208;loading, and 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;% in a 15&#8197;g scale) and good stability (alleviates the use of glovebox). {BArF=tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene}.







Abstract
Reported herein is a convenient and efficient method for one&#8208;pot, catalytic reductive amination, as well as the first multi&#8208;component tandem reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of bench&#8208;stable and readily available common carboxylic esters. This method is based on the cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective hydrosilylation of esters, followed by one&#8208;pot acid&#8208;mediated amination and nucleophilic addition. The reaction was conducted under mild conditions at a very low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ir), which could be further reduced to 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;%, as demonstrated by a reaction at a 15&#8197;g scale. The method is highly versatile, allowing the use of esters with or without &#945;&#8208;protons for the N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylation of primary and secondary amines to produce diverse secondary and tertiary amines, as well as &#945;&#8208;branched/functionalized amines. The method is highly chemoselective and tolerates a variety of functional groups such as bromo, trifluoromethyl, ester, and cyano groups. The value of the method was demonstrated by the one&#8208;step catalytic synthesis of two bio&#8208;relevant N&#8208;mono&#8208;methyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters and the antiparkinsonian agent piribedil, as well as by the use of two shorter chain triglycerides as alkylating feedstock.

         <title>Promoting Hydrogen Transfer in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction via a Hydrogen on Demand Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism was proposed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, realizing the hydrogen supply matches CO2 protonation. This new mechanism addresses the contradiction between activity and selectivity faced with the traditional &#8220;hydrogen supply&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn&#8722;N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of &#8722;539.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiencies of CO &gt;90&#8201;% over a broad window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 in flow cell. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2&#8722; with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.

         <title>Reversing Surface Charge for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface charge reversal strategy is introduced to regulate the charge character of organic photovoltaic catalyst (OPC). Nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by cationic surfactant exhibit a raised Fermi level, larger surface band bending and Schottky barrier relative to OPC NPs stabilized by anionic surfactant, enhancing charge separation and transfer efficiency while suppressing charge carrier recombination and therefore demonstrating better photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic materials typically exhibit low charge separation and transfer efficiency and severe exciton/carrier recombination due to high exciton binding energy and short exciton diffusion lengths, limiting the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Here, we introduce a surface charge reversal strategy to regulate the charge character of organic photovoltaic catalyst (OPC). Compared to OPC nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by an anionic surfactant ((&#8722;)&#8201;NPs), NPs stabilized by a cationic surfactant ((+)&#8201;NPs) exhibit a raised Fermi level, larger surface band bending and Schottky barrier, thereby enhancing charge separation and transfer efficiency while suppressing charge carrier recombination. As a result, (+)&#8201;NPs demonstrate better photocatalytic performance than (&#8722;)&#8201;NPs, independent of the chemical structure of OPCs and surfactant molecules. Under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the PM6: 2FBP&#8208;4F NPs stabilized by cationic surfactant (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, DTAB) exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (up to 946.1&#177;15.76&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) than that of PM6: 2FBP&#8208;4F NPs stabilized by anionic surfactant, among the best results reported so far for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated sunlight.

         <title>Unveiling the Photoluminescence Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Evolution and Synergistic Photoluminescence of Multiple Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular fluorophore named 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,8,13,14&#8208;tetrahaydroimidazo[2,3&#8208;k][4,7,11]&#8208;triazaacephenanthrylene&#8208;1,5,10(12H)&#8208;trione (IATO) was separated from the carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) prepared with citric acid and ethylenediamine. IATO had been proven to evolve from 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;7&#8208;carboxylic acid (IPCA). Further research revealed the whole photoluminescence mechanism of CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic photoluminescence of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle.







Abstract
Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are a class of exceptional fluorescent materials with diverse applications. However, their photoluminescence (PL) mechanism remained enigmatic and controversial, hindering further development and application. While molecular fluorophores explain primary fluorescence in some CPDs, the overall PL of CPDs still cannot be fully explained, such as their excitation&#8208;dependent behaviors, let alone the modulation of PL. Besides, the extracted molecular fluorophores are dissociative, raising questions including the purity of CPDs and whether the PL of CPDs nanoparticles come from these molecular fluorophores. Here, the emission around 510&#8197;nm of citric acid&#8208;ethylenediamine CPDs (CA&#8208;EDA CPDs) was proved to be contributed by a molecular fluorophore, which evolved from another molecular fluorophore following the quantum confinement effect. Further research revealed the whole PL mechanism of CA&#8208;EDA CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic PL of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle. The evolution of molecular fluorophores had also been observed in another two systems, indicating the universality of this mechanism, and a new approach for regulating the optical properties of CPDs was put forward inspired by this mechanism. This study not only refined the PL mechanism but also paved the way for future advancements of CPDs.

         <title>Rapidly Generated, Ultra&#8208;Stable, and Switchable Photoinduced Radicals: A Solid&#8208;State Photochromic Paradigm for Reusable Paper Light&#8208;Writing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapidly responsive and ultra&#8208;stable photoinduced radical platform was constructed by the anti&#8208;parallelly aligned para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes. The ultra&#8208;fast high&#8208;contrast photochromism upon UV irradiation is stable for 3&#8197;months in dark. The superior photochromic behavior also remains in the ground sample, for which it can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing.







Abstract
Although photochromic molecules have attracted widespread interest in various fields, solid&#8208;state photochromism remains a formidable challenge, owing to the substantial conformational constraints that hinder traditional molecular photoisomerization processes. Benefiting from the significant color change upon radical generation, chemical systems enabling a photoinduced radical (PIR) behavior through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) could be ideal candidates for solid&#8208;state photochromism within minimized need of conformational freedom. However, the transient nature of radicals causes a dilemma in this Scheme. Herein, we present a general crystal engineering strategy for rapidly generated (7&#8208;s irradiation to saturation) and ultra&#8208;stable (lasting 12&#8197;weeks) PIRs in the solid state, based on the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes to form a strong non&#8208;covalent network for efficient PET and radical stabilization. Using this strategy, a PIR platform was constructed, with a superior photochromic behavior remaining in different solid forms (even in the fully&#8208;ground sample) due to their transcendent crystallization ability. On this basis, our compounds can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing, accompanied by water fumigation for modulating the reversible process. This work provides new insights into addressing solid&#8208;state photochromism and can inspire a wide range of optical material design from the switchable radical perspective.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction and Application of Axially Chiral Spiro&#8208;bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization, a class of configurationally stable axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole skeletons were accessed for the first time with excellent enantiocontrol. Further stereospecific elaborations of the resulting highly enantioenriched products afforded axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.







Abstract
Spiro skeletons have emerged as a privileged class of chiral carriers across various research fields, including asymmetric catalysis and functional materials, due to their remarkable configurational rigidity. However, limited structural diversity of spiro frameworks significantly restricts the expansion of their applications. Here we present a new class of axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole frameworks and report their first enantioselective construction via a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction. Unlike the classical SPINOL backbone, incorporation of indole moieties in place of phenol enhances the nucleophilicity of ketone substrates, thereby eliminating the need for a tedious pre&#8208;activation process. By leveraging the retained active sites of indole, the resulting highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles can be rapidly transformed into other valuable structures. More importantly, axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency are readily accessed, opening a new avenue for developing chiral fluorescent materials. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of both unmasked N&#8722;H bonds in achieving good efficiency and enantiocontrol.

         <title>BN&#8208;Acene Ladder with Enhanced Charge Transport for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit were prepared via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. In micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), these compounds demonstrate enhanced charge transport, achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which ranks among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAH&#8208;based OFETs.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth research on the charge transport properties of BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) still lags far behind studies of their emitting properties. Herein, we report the successfully synthesis of novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;PAHs (BCNL1 and BCNL2) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit, achieved via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed their unique and compact herringbone packing structures. Micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) demonstrated that an enhanced charge transport capability, with BCNL2 achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8211;three orders of magnitude higher than that of BCNL1 (&#956;hmax=6 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), ranking among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAHs&#8208;based OFETs. Detailed calculations attribute this significant enhancement in the hole mobility to the marked reduction in reorganization energy (&#955;) of BCNL2, resulting from the five&#8208;membered pyrrole ring annulation and molecular skeleton elongation. This work provides insight into molecular design principles for potential BN&#8208;PAHs in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of Metallocluster Inside Heterometal&#8208;Organic Cage to Switch Electron Transfer for Targeted CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetranuclear Cu cluster was coordinated endogamously inside a cluster&#8208;based heterometallic&#8208;organic cage which takes a crucial role in modulating the orbital alignment for a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state towards targeted CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.







Abstract
Construction of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with internal modifications is a promising avenue to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities and unlocking the mystery of highly catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes. However, current interests are mainly focused on single&#8208;metal&#8208;node cages, little achievement has been expended to metallocluster&#8208;based architectures, and the in situ endogenous generation of metal clusters. Herein, based on the hard&#8208;soft&#8208;acids&#8208;bases (HSAB), the metallocluster&#8208;based heterometallic MOC (Cu3VMOP) constructed of [Cu3OPz3]+ and [V6O6(OCH3)9(SO4)(CO2)3]2&#8722; clusters was obtained by one&#8208;pot method. In addition, Cu4I4 was generated in situ in the cage to form Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP by the coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy. As catalysts for CO2 reduction, Cu3VMOP produces HCOOH and CH3COOH as the main reduction product with yield of CH3COOH up to 0.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest value of reported materials, whereas Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP exhibited targeted CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion with 100&#8201;% formic acid selectivity and the yield outperforms that of Cu3VMOP by 5 fold. Theoretical calculations and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption reveal that endogenous Cu4I4 not only regulates orbital arrangements and enhances localized electron states to generate a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state, but also raises *CO coupling energy barrier, resulting in the targeted conversion of CO2 to formic acid.

         <title>Tunable Mechanically Interlocked Semi&#8208;Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked semi&#8208;crystalline polymer networks were constructed to achieve the synchronous enhancement of seemingly conflicting material properties including mechanical robustness, toughness, elasticity and reprocessability. The improvement was ascribed to the synergic mechanism of mechanical interlocked crosslinks, physical crystalline domains, and dynamic disulfide bonding.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance polymers based on dynamic chemistry have been widely explored for multi&#8208;field advanced applications. However, noncovalent sacrificial bond&#8208;mediated energy dissipation mechanism causes a trade&#8208;off between mechanical toughness and resilience. Herein, we achieved the synchronous boost of seemingly conflicting material properties including mechanical robustness, toughness and elasticity via the incorporation of mechanical chemistry into traditional semi&#8208;crystalline networks. Detailed rheological tests and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the excellent mechanical robustness and toughness are attributed to the dissociation of crystalline domains threading through the sieve&#8208;shape macrocycles. Reversible nano&#8208;crystalline domains and ring&#8208;sliding&#8208;effect accelerated segment motion efficiently reduce energy dissipation to achieve instantaneous resilience. Moreover, the model polymers demonstrate that the multiple dynamic components endow the resulting polymer with excellent reprocessability under mild conditions. This mechanically interlocked semi&#8208;crystalline polymer exhibits potential applications as a thermal/photo actuator. This work reveals the synergic effects of mechanically interlocked sites and tunable crystalline domains, thus providing a reliable guide for the comprehensive improvement of material performance.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Induced Spin&#8208;State Switching Based on Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature and light&#8208;dependent synergistic switching effects in magnetic, structural, and spectral properties have been discovered for a three&#8208;dimensional spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material [FeII(4&#8208;acetylpyridine)2][HgII(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4]. Tunable terahertz absorption through temperature and light stimuli is associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers through SCO behavior supported by ab initio calculation.







Abstract
The development of molecular switches with tunable properties has garnered considerable interest over several decades. A novel spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material based on iron(II) complexes incorporating 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;acpy) and [Hg(SCN)4]2&#8722; anions was synthesized and formulated as [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2][Hg(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4] (1). Compound 1 is crystallized in a three&#8208;dimensional network in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Pna21 with two octahedral [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2(NCS)4] entities featuring two distinct Fe centers (Fe1 and Fe2). Crystallographic, magnetic, and M&#246;ssbauer measurements reveal an incomplete SCO exclusively at Fe2, with transition temperature T1/2&#8776;102&#8197;K. Photomagnetic studies conducted at 10&#8197;K with lasers ranging from 405 to 1310&#8197;nm evidence light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (LIESST) and reverse&#8208;LIESST effects, with a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LIESST phenomenon at 1064 and 1310&#8197;nm. Advanced photocrystallographic studies at 40&#8197;K provide precise structural evidence for these metastable states. The optical and vibrational properties consistently corroborate with magnetic and photomagnetic studies. Additionally, temperature&#8208; and light&#8208;dependent terahertz (THz) absorptions are associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers, through SCO behavior, as supported by ab initio calculation. The Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) systems can be promising benchmarks for exploring synergistic switching effects in structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic properties.

A methylthiocarbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acid, MeS&#8208;4PACz, capable of forming a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide has been developed. The molecule induces an interfacial dipole and passivates iodide vacancies in FAPbI3 perovskite. Inverted perovskite solar cells using MeS&#8208;4PACz SAM as a hole&#8208;selective layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.134&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light&#8208;absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS&#8208;4PACz), which forms a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule&#8216;s methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well&#8208;aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb2+ ions of the perovskite, reducing defect&#8208;induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS&#8208;4PACz achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.13&#8201;%, along with outstanding photostability.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced Ordered Carbonaceous Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method is proposed to induce phase separation of the assembled units and the evolution of micellar templates, enabling the successful construction of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced hierarchical superstructures in a single preparation step. These superstructures exhibit a unique surface architecture composed of discontinuous nanodots and demonstrate enhanced catalytic activity, showcasing excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries.







Abstract
Constructing hierarchical superstructures through one&#8208;step bottom&#8208;up synthesis poses significant challenges due to strong interactions between additives and micelles, which hinders the formation of heterogeneous configurations. Here, we propose a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method to weaken these interactions and manipulate the thermal instability of micellar templates. This approach successfully synthesizes hierarchical superstructures that combine a carbonaceous nanosheet substrate with polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced, highly ordered discontinuous nanodots in a single preparation step. The surface nanodots have a diameter of approximately 19&#8197;nm and are spaced about 32&#8197;nm apart. Besides, the nanodots with various arrangements can be generated by simply adjusting the amount of POM. Importantly, the superstructure features more exposed POM catalytic sites than conventional carbonaceous hybrids lacking surface architectures, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. This high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated approach offers new insights for designing hierarchical superstructures and functional materials with enhanced activities.

         <title>Spherical Mg/Cu Co&#8208;Doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 Cathode Materials with Mitigated Diffusion&#8208;Induced Stresses and Enhanced Cyclic Stability</title>

Spherical Na4Fe2.96Mg0.02Cu0.02(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP) cathode materials have been successfully synthesized via the combination of spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method. The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP. While, the small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry exhibit an enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables a low high&#8208;stress concentration and alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress during the extensive (de)sodiation cycling.







Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been regarded as the promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical applications of NFPP are hindered by its high&#8208;volume changes, poor intrinsic electron conductivity and sluggish Na+ ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, a spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method have been utilized to fabricate the spherical trace amount Mg/Cu co&#8208;doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP). The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP by reducing band gap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the unique spherical structured NFMCPP with a carbon film even coated on its surface ensures rapid electron transport. Moreover, small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry demonstrate an alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress and enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables fluent Na+ extraction/insertion, leads to a low high&#8208;stress concentration and uniform stress/strain distribution during extensive (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the optimized spherical NFMCPP cathode materials exhibit an excellent rate capability and cyclic stability.

         <title>Isomerism Effect of 3D Dimeric Acceptors for Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with 20&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular isomerization strategy was employed to develop 3D dimeric acceptors (CH8&#8208;4/4A/4B), which demonstrate varying molecular pre&#8208;aggregation in o&#8208;xylene. These distinctive properties significantly affect the film&#8208;forming process and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the moderate pre&#8208;aggregation of CH8&#8208;4, an impressive efficiency of 20.0&#8201;% was received for CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based device, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in non&#8208;halogen solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic materials that can be processed via non&#8208;halogenated solvents are crucial for the large&#8208;area manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited available of electron acceptors with adequate solubility and favorable molecular packing presents a challenge in achieving efficient non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. Herein, inspired by the three&#8208;dimensional dimeric acceptor CH8&#8208;4, we employed a molecular isomerization strategy to synthesize its isomers, CH8&#8208;4A and CH8&#8208;4B, by tuning the position of fluorine (F) atom in the central unit. The differing intramolecular fluorine&#8208;sulfur non&#8208;covalent interactions among these isomers led to differences in molecular pre&#8208;aggregation abilities (CH8&#8208;4B&lt;CH8&#8208;4&lt;CH8&#8208;4A) in o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) solution, which significantly influence the film&#8208;forming process and the resultant morphological characteristics. Among these, the blend film of CH8&#8208;4, characterized by moderate molecular pre&#8208;aggregation, achieved optimal bi&#8208;continuous donor/acceptor phase separation. Consequently, the o&#8208;xylene processed PM6&#8201;:&#8201;CH8&#8208;4 device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1&#8201;%, outperforming that of two other devices. By incorporating L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D as a guest acceptor, we attained an impressive PCE of 20.0&#8201;% for the CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based ternary device, alongside a high PCE nearing 16&#8201;% for the mini&#8208;module (13.5&#8197;cm2). Our findings underscore the potential of isomerism in 3D dimer acceptors to enhance the performance of eco&#8208;friendly OSCs.

         <title>Inverting Methanol Dehydrogenation Selectivity by Crowding Atomic Ni Species over &#945;&#8208;MoC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal carbides are promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts but face challenges in controlling reaction pathways due to strong adsorption of reactants. This study shows that bare &#945;&#8208;MoC favors bimolecular methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate and H2, while Ni&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;MoC shifts selectivity to monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2. Mechanistic insights reveal Ni sites enhance C&#8722;H bond cleavage, enabling complete alcohol dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal carbides with earth&#8208;abundant elements are widely regarded as promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts. Although comparable catalytic performances have been observed for metal carbides in several types of reactions, precise control of reaction pathways on them remains a formidable challenge, partially due to strong adsorption of reactants or intermediates. In this study, we show that bimolecular dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate and H2 is kinetically favored on bare &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts, while monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2 becomes the dominant pathway when &#945;&#8208;MoC is decorated with crowding atomic Ni species. Under optimal conditions, excellent selectivities of the target products (&gt;90&#8201;%) were achieved in both cases, with unprecedented production rates of methyl formate and H2 for the former and latter mechanisms, respectively. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational assessments were integrated to clarify the mechanism driving this remarkable selectivity inversion. Isolated Ni sites bound to &#945;&#8208;MoC exhibit superior dehydrogenation activity, which promotes complete cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol&#8208;derived intermediates rather than the C&#8722;O coupling between them. Our study offers an effective approach to modulating the selectivity of carbide&#8208;based catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation towards different target products.

In this study, we show that bimolecular dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is kinetically favored on bare &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-MoC catalysts, while monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; becomes the dominant pathway when &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-MoC is decorated with crowding atomic Ni species. Under optimal conditions, excellent selectivities of the target products (&amp;gt;90&#8201;%) were achieved in both cases, with unprecedented production rates of methyl formate and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the former and latter mechanisms, respectively. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational assessments were integrated to clarify the mechanism driving this remarkable selectivity inversion. Isolated Ni sites bound to &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-MoC exhibit superior dehydrogenation activity, which promotes complete cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol-derived intermediates rather than the C&#8722;O coupling between them. Our study offers an effective approach to modulating the selectivity of carbide-based catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation towards different target products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Coverage Tuning for Suppressing Over&#8208;Oxidation: A Case of Photoelectrochemical Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde/Ketone Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has been found that oxidative species derived from H2O exhibit a stronger competitive adsorption ability compared to alcohol substrates during photoelectrochemical (PEC) alcohol oxidation, leading to poor formation of pre&#8208;oxidized intermediates and excessive alcohol oxidation. However, after PEC polarization, the adsorption of alcohol substrates is significantly enhanced, enabling competition with oxidative species. This boosts the formation of pre&#8208;oxidized intermediates, effectively suppressing alcohol over&#8208;oxidation and enhancing the oxidation kinetics of alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde conversion.







Abstract
Suppressing over&#8208;oxidation is a crucial challenge for various chemical intermediate synthesis in heterogeneous catalysis. The distribution of oxidative species and the substrate coverage, governed by the direction of electron transfer, are believed to influence the oxidation extent. In this study, we presented an experimental realization of surface coverage modulation on a photoelectrode using a photo&#8208;induced charge activation method. Through the surface coverage modulation, both pre&#8208;oxidized alcohol substrates and surface coverage were increased, which not only improved the reaction kinetics but also suppressed the over&#8208;oxidation of the generated aldehydes/ketones. As a demonstration, the Faradaic efficiency for the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone increased from 31.8&#8201;% to 46.8&#8201;% (with selectivity rising from 47.6&#8201;% to 71.3&#8201;%), from 73.4&#8201;% to 87.8&#8201;% for benzyl alcohol to benzyl aldehyde (selectivity increasing from 76.7&#8201;% to 92.4&#8201;%) and from 4.2&#8201;% to 53.6&#8201;% for ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde (selectivity increasing from 6.2&#8201;% to 62.7&#8201;%). Our findings offer a promising strategy for the production of high&#8208;value carbon products in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis Enables Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclopropene and Ring Expansion of Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding interaction enables catalyzing the ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In contrast, transition metal and thermal approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. This research reveals that chalcogen bonding catalysts can play a role in producing and regulating carbene species, thus providing an alternative platform for solving reactivity problem in carbene transformations.







Abstract
Catalytic transformation of carbene species constitutes a fundamental part in organic synthesis, and the research in this direction has been dominated by transition metals while organic catalysts are difficult to mimic such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity. It would significantly advance carbene chemistry if organic catalysts enable achieving classical metal&#8208;carbene approaches otherwise unrealizable reactions. Herein, we report that chalcogen bonding catalysis can solve reactivity problem to achieve an elusive Buchner ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In this work, the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and the ring&#8208;expansion of aryl systems were added in the field of noncovalent catalysis. This work demonstrates that chalcogen bonding can mediate carbene transformations beyond the known ionic approach. In contrast, transition metals such as rhodium, palladium, and copper complexes, could not solve the reactivity problem to achieve ring expansion of aryl ketones but instead these metal&#8208;carbene approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. In addition, a thermal approach even being conducted at 200&#8201;&#176;C could not achieve this ring expansion reaction. Mechanistic investigation suggests Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction with cyclopropene facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and chalcogen bonding with carbene intermediate changes the reaction pathway, thus overriding the furan reaction pathway.

         <title>Partially Interstitial Silicon&#8208;Implanted Ruthenium as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partially interstitial silicon implanted ruthenium not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. In addition, the spontaneously generated built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption property of the Ru sites, further significantly lowering the thermodynamic energy barrier for the alkaline HER.







Abstract
To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H) at Ru&#8208;top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru&#8208;top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru&#8208;hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G*H. To promote the transformation of Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8722;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.

         <title>Molecular Micellar Aggregate Electrolytes Enable Durable Electrochemical Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular micellar aggregate is designed as non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for stable and high&#8208;voltage electrochemical proton storage. Such aggregates impart rapid and stable electrochemical proton storage with a widened operating voltage (1.8&#8197;V vs. 1.5&#8197;V in aqueous electrolyte). A symmetric full proton battery using the optimal CTAB electrolyte achieves a maximum energy density of 102.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 10.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Proton electrochemistry holds eminent potential for developing high capacity and rate energy storage devices in the post&#8208;lithium era. However, the decomposition of water in acidic aqueous electrolytes causes electrode corrosion, leading to capacity fading. Herein, we report a judicious design of molecular micellar aggregates as non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for stable and high&#8208;voltage electrochemical proton storage. The key to our strategy lies in introducing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), forming micelles to improve the miscibility of acetonitrile (ACN) and H3PO4, afford channel for proton transport, and electrostatically interact with phosphate ions of H3PO4 to further promote proton transport. Such aggregates impart rapid and stable electrochemical proton storage with a widened operating voltage (1.8&#8197;V vs. 1.5&#8197;V in aqueous electrolyte). By optimizing CTAB content, proton transport can be enhanced. Asymmetric full proton battery using the optimal CTAB electrolyte achieves a maximum energy density of 102.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 10.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our simple yet robust route to micellar aggregate electrolytes enables stable proton storage, underscoring its potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, emergency power supplies, and portable electronics.

         <title>Multifaceted Hidden Catalysis Revealed by Mechanistic Analysis of FeBr3&#8208;Catalysed Arene Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic analysis revealed the iron&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H borylation of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ([H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]2) operates through hidden catalysis with the iron salt mediating the formation of Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, the active catalyst. The reaction was shown to proceed through an electrophilic borylation mechanism.







Abstract
Arene borylation reactions provide direct access to aryl organoboranes, including aryl boronic esters. Precious metals, namely Ir, Rh, Pt, remain the go&#8208;to for metal&#8208;catalysed borylation reactions, however, significant efforts have been expended in developing Earth&#8208;abundant metal alternatives. The iron&#8208;catalysed borylation of 2&#8208;aryl pyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN) offers unique reactivity by using only FeBr3 as the catalyst, without added ligand(s). Mechanistic analysis of this borylation reaction revealed an alternative, hidden catalysis pathway whereby the iron salt acts not as a borylation catalyst, but as an initiator for the generation of a catalytically active haloborane, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. The roles of iron salt, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, and HBr in catalyst formation, the mode of catalytic turnover, and catalyst regeneration were all determined using single&#8208;turnover and catalytic studies. The borylation reaction was found to proceed by a catalytic electrophilic borylation using, in situ generated, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. These studies highlight a new, orthogonal method of generating haloboranes and their previously unobserved role as hidden catalysts within arene borylation reactions.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Plasma&#8208;Driven Ammonia Synthesis Using a AuCu3/Cu Composite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient radio&#8208;frequency (RF) plasma&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis has been achieved using an integrated AuCu3/Cu composite catalyst. The Cu antenna facilitates the generation of reactive species, while surface AuCu3 nanoparticles (NPs) serve as catalytic sites for efficient ammonia synthesis, owing to the unique Cu&#8722;Au interface and a downshifted d&#8208;band center. The synergistic effect of Cu antenna and surface AuCu3 NPs comprehensively boosts ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
Green ammonia synthesis using fluctuating renewable energy supply in decentralized process is a goal that has been long sought after. Ammonia synthesis with non&#8208;thermal plasma under mild conditions is a promising technology, but it faces the critical challenge of low energy efficiency. Herein, we develop an easily&#8208;scalable AuCu3/Cu catalyst, which consists of a decimeter&#8208;scale metallic Cu antenna and nano&#8208;scale AuCu3 catalytic sites on metallic Cu surface, significantly enhancing the energy efficiency and ammonia yield in a radio&#8208;frequency (RF) plasma system. Compared to plasma alone, the single&#8208;pass ammonia yield over AuCu3/Cu increases by a factor of 20, approaching 10&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies indicate that Cu antenna can amplify the millimeter&#8208;scale local electric field, thereby facilitating the generation of active nitrogen species, including nitrogen radicals and vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecules. Due to the downshifted d&#8208;band center and unique Cu&#8722;Au interface structure, the AuCu3 nanoalloy modified on Cu antenna surface significantly reduces hydrogenation barriers of active NHX (x=0,1,2) species (the rate&#8208;determining step) and facilitates ammonia desorption at lower temperature. The synergistic effect of Cu antenna and surface AuCu3 nanoalloy comprehensively enhances ammonia synthesis through both the nitrogen radical&#8208;mediated Eley&#8208;Rideal pathway and the vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecule&#8208;mediated Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway.

         <title>Molecular Customization of Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfaces for Enhanced Stability and Reversibility in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Carbon Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyridine group enables interfacial aggregation and anchoring of vitamin molecules, while the hydroxyl group coordinates with Zn2+, optimizing the solvation structure near the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This dual modulation regulates Zn2+ deposition, reducing corrosion and hydrogen evolution, enhancing zinc electrochemistry reversibility and enhancing zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors&#8217; cycling stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors display application potential in green power and high&#8208;end equipment owing to their high security, large power and sustainability. The water&#8208;rich zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface (AEI) and disordered zinc&#8208;ion diffusion are the culprits triggering corrosion reactions and dendrite growth, threatening the sustainability of aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors. Herein, a polyfunctional biomolecular, vitamin B6, is introduced into the traditional aqueous electrolyte for customizing the functional AEI and fine&#8208;regulating the interfacial coordination environment of zinc ions. Specifically, the preferential anchoring of pyridine nitrogen enables trace vitamin (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) to construct a robust AEI and suppress corrosion reactions. The hydroxyl function zone provides high&#8208;octane guidance for zinc&#8208;ion diffusion at the AEI, resulting in flat zinc (002) oriented growth. Consequently, the Zn//Zn symmetrical cell features an ultrahigh cumulative capacity of 4.0&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 34&#8201;% depth of discharge. The vitamin&#8208;optimized zinc&#8208;carbon capacitor features extended operational lifetimes exceeding 8&#8197;months (200 thousand cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and demonstrates a high areal capacity of averaging 0.68&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exceptional durability over 2000&#8197;hours at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 under a high discharge depth of zinc anode (averaging 11.6&#8201;%). This work offers valuable insights into sustainable and cost&#8208;effective zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors.

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;Oxazoline) as Super&#8208;Hydrophilic Antifouling Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protected alcohol functional 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (AcOMeOx) is synthesized with the aim of making a super hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) for biomedical applications. The monomer showed unanticipated and intriguing reactivity during CROP as it very slowly polymerizes at low temperature while the polymerization rate constant at high temperature is amongst the highest known values. Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that EtOx is incorporated at a faster rate than the AcOMeOx, confirming both the low nucleophilicity of AcOMeOx and the chain end&#8208;activation by the ester side chains. Hydrolysis of the PAcOMeOx generates poly(2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PHOMeOx) which is found to be the most hydrophilic non&#8208;ionic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) reported to date. Strong anti&#8208;fouling properties of intensely hydrophilic and cytocompatible PHOMeOx against serum protein was confirmed from the cell association study.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ionic &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; polymers generally possess strong non&#8208;fouling characteristics and, therefore, can suppress non&#8208;specific and unwanted interactions with blood proteins when attached to in vivo nanomedicine ranging from drug or gene delivery to diagnostics. In this contribution, we revitalize a protected alcohol functionalized 2&#8208;oxazoline monomer, 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline, that was first reported almost fifty&#8208;five years ago and explore the possibility of making &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s for biomedical applications. The synthesis of the 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline monomer and its cationic ring&#8208;opening homopolymerization and copolymerization kinetics are reported. The monomer showed unanticipated and intriguing reactivity during homopolymerization as it very slowly polymerizes at low temperature while the polymerization rate constant at high temperature is amongst the highest known values. Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that AcOMeOx is incorporated at a slower rate than EtOx confirming its lower nucleophilicity, while EtOx was accelerated in the copolymerization indicating chain&#8208;end activation by the ester side&#8208;chains. Subsequently, controlled hydrolysis of the resulting poly(2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PAcOMeOx) generates the alcohol (&#8722;OH) side chain functional poly(2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PHOMeOx). The relative hydrophilicity of PHOMeOx was analyzed and compared with the previously reported most hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s, such as poly(2&#8208;methoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) and poly(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), revealing that PHOMeOx is the most hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) reported to date. Finally, the cytocompatibility of these different hydrophilic polymers with MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells was explored where all polymers revealed high cytocompatibility. Most importantly, strong anti&#8208;fouling properties of the most hydrophilic PHOMeOx against serum protein were observed during the cell association studies. Hence, the &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; and anti&#8208;fouling PHOMeOx might be an interesting candidate to be explored in the area of polymeric drug and gene delivery as well as anti&#8208;fouling surfaces.

Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that EtOx is incorporated at a faster rate than the AcOMeOx, confirming both the low nucleophilicity of AcOMeOx and the chain end-activation by the ester side chains. Hydrolysis of the PAcOMeOx generates poly(2-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazoline) (PHOMeOx) which is found to be the most hydrophilic non-ionic poly(2-oxazoline) reported to date. Strong anti-fouling properties of intensely hydrophilic and cytocompatible PHOMeOx against serum protein was confirmed from the cell association study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-ionic &#8220;super-hydrophilic&#8221; polymers generally possess strong non-fouling characteristics and, therefore, can suppress non-specific and unwanted interactions with blood proteins when attached to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; nanomedicine ranging from drug or gene delivery to diagnostics. In this contribution, we revitalize a protected alcohol functionalized 2-oxazoline monomer, 2-acetoxymethyl-2-oxazoline, that was first reported almost fifty-five years ago and explore the possibility of making &#8220;super-hydrophilic&#8221; poly(2-oxazoline)s for biomedical applications. The synthesis of the 2-acetoxymethyl-2-oxazoline monomer and its cationic ring-opening homopolymerization and copolymerization kinetics are reported. The monomer showed unanticipated and intriguing reactivity during homopolymerization as it very slowly polymerizes at low temperature while the polymerization rate constant at high temperature is amongst the highest known values. Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that AcOMeOx is incorporated at a slower rate than EtOx confirming its lower nucleophilicity, while EtOx was accelerated in the copolymerization indicating chain-end activation by the ester side-chains. Subsequently, controlled hydrolysis of the resulting poly(2-acetoxymethyl-2-oxazoline) (PAcOMeOx) generates the alcohol (&#8722;OH) side chain functional poly(2-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazoline) (PHOMeOx). The relative hydrophilicity of PHOMeOx was analyzed and compared with the previously reported most hydrophilic poly(2-oxazoline)s, such as poly(2-methoxymethyl-2-oxazoline) and poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline), revealing that PHOMeOx is the most hydrophilic poly(2-oxazoline) reported to date. Finally, the cytocompatibility of these different hydrophilic polymers with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was explored where all polymers revealed high cytocompatibility. Most importantly, strong anti-fouling properties of the most hydrophilic PHOMeOx against serum protein were observed during the cell association studies. Hence, the &#8220;super-hydrophilic&#8221; and anti-fouling PHOMeOx might be an interesting candidate to be explored in the area of polymeric drug and gene delivery as well as anti-fouling surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Printing Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy for Microvasculature using Degradable DNA Biolubricant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature. Utilizing the DNA hydrogel as biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature and cell&#8208;laden tissue constructs with branched microvasculatures.







Abstract
Microvasculature is essential for the continued function of cells in tissue and is fundamental in the fields of tissue engineering, organ repair and drug screening. However, the fabrication of microvasculature is still challenging using existing strategies. Here, we developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature, which eliminates the need for a subsequent cell seeding process and the associated deficiencies. Utilizing the shear&#8208;thinning property of DNA hydrogels as a novel sacrificial, cell&#8208;laden biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature, breaking the limit of 100&#8197;&#956;m. To our best knowledge, this is the smallest endothelialized microvasculature that has ever been bioprinted so far. In addition, the self&#8208;healing property of DNA hydrogels allows the creation of continuous branched structures. This strategy provides a new platform for constructing complex hierarchical vascular networks and offers new opportunity towards engineering thick tissues. The extremely low volume of sacrificial biolubricant paves the way for DNA hydrogels to be used in practical tissue engineering applications. The high&#8208;resolution bioprinting technique also exhibits great potential for printing lymphatics, retinas and neural networks in the future.

         <title>Unveiling the Structure&#8208;Fluorogenic Property Relationship of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Derived Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized fluorogenic Seoul&#8208;Fluor (SF)&#8208;based tetrazine (Tz) probes with differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Through electronic modifications and quantum calculations, we elucidated the relationship between dienophile&#8208;Tz adduct structures and their fluorogenic properties. These probes enabled simultaneous multicolor bioorthogonal imaging of diverse cellular targets using a single probe.







Abstract
Tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;embedded fluorescent probes, known for their fluorogenicity following bioorthogonal inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) reactions, are extensively used in bioimaging. Despite extensive research on fluorogenic Tz probes, there has been limited systematic exploration of their fluorogenic responses with various dienophiles. In this study, we elucidate the structure&#8208;fluorogenic property relationship of bioorthogonal Tz probes. We synthesized a series of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Tz (SFTz) probes designed to exhibit differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon iEDDA reactions with three dienophiles: trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Our findings revealed that the fluorogenic properties of the SFTz probes are highly dependent on the structures of Tz&#8208;dienophile adducts. By systematically modifying the electronic properties and employing quantum chemical calculations, we developed a series of SFTz probes with optimal dienophile&#8208;dependent fluorescence. These probes enabled simultaneous dual&#8208;color imaging of different cellular targets using a single probe, providing a robust approach for advanced bioimaging applications that require precise and efficient multicolor labeling strategies.

         <title>Engineering Electrolyte Network Structure for Improved Kinetics and Dendrite Suppression in Zn&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating co&#8208;solvents (PM) and additives (ZnI2), the electrolyte network structure was optimized, enhancing the interfacial stability between the cathode and anode while promoting the reversibility of sulfur cathodic transitions. Experimental results demonstrated that PM reshaped the ligand structure, improving Zn2+ transport kinetics. Additionally, PM interacted synergistically with ZnI2 to reduce cell polarization, catalyze sulfur cathode reactions, and mitigate I3&#8722;&#8208;induced zinc anode corrosion, significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of the aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur battery.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries (Zn&#8722;S) are promising alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion technology due to their high energy density, low cost, and enhanced safety. However, challenges such as slow redox kinetics of sulfur cathode conversion and inadequate anode stability persist. This study demonstrates that by tuning the electrolyte structure with the introduction of propylene glycol methyl ether (PM) as a co&#8208;solvent and ZnI2 as an electrolyte additive, and significant improvements at both electrodes could be achieved. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the larger polar &#8722;OH and C&#8722;O&#8722;C electron&#8208;donating groups in the PM molecule can donate electrons for the redox reaction of I&#8722;/I3&#8722;. Its role as a redox mediator improves the reversibility of the sulfur cathodic transformation. Additionally, the dipole moment induced by the hydroxyl groups in PM enhances electron transfer from the zinc anode to the electrolyte and promote the decomposition of anions (OTF&#8722;), improving the interfacial stability of the zinc anode. The synergistic effect of PM and the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator pair enables the zinc&#8208;sulfur battery to deliver an impressive capacity of 1456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 471.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Optimizing s&#8211;p Orbital Overlap Between Sodium Polysulfides and Single&#8208;Atom Indium Catalyst for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

The s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree between the s orbitals of Na in sodium polysulfides and the p orbitals of the carbon&#8208;supported p&#8208;block single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which serves as a descriptor to efficiently design promising nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 SACs with excellent sulfur reduction and oxidation reaction activities.







Abstract
P&#8208;block metal carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (C&#8208;SACs) have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, due to their high atom utilization and unique electronic structure. However, the ambiguous electronic&#8208;level understanding of Na&#8208;dominant s&#8208;p hybridization between sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs limits the precise control of coordination environment tuning and electro&#8208;catalytic activity manipulation. Here, s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree (OOD) between the s orbitals of Na in NaPSs and the p orbitals of p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs is proposed as a descriptor for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR). Compared to NG and NG&#8208;supported InN4 (NG&#8208;InN4) SACs, the nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 (NG&#8208;InN5) SACs show the largest s&#8208;p OOD, demonstrating the weakest shuttle effect and the lowest reaction energy barriers in both SRR and SOR. Accordingly, the designed catalysts allow the Na&#8722;S pouch batteries to retain a high capacity of 490.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4.5&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mg&#8722;1. This work offers an s&#8208;p orbital overlap descriptor describing the interaction between NaPSs and p&#8208;orbital&#8208;dominated catalysts for high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8722;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The s-p orbital overlap degree&lt;/b&gt; between the &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of Na in sodium polysulfides and the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of the carbon-supported &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;block single-atom catalysts (SACs), which serves as a descriptor to efficiently design promising nitrogen-doped graphene-supported InN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SACs with excellent sulfur reduction and oxidation reaction activities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;P-&lt;/i&gt;block metal carbon-supported single-atom catalysts (C-SACs) have emerged as a promising candidate for high-performance room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, due to their high atom utilization and unique electronic structure. However, the ambiguous electronic-level understanding of Na-dominant &lt;i&gt;s-p&lt;/i&gt; hybridization between sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;block C-SACs limits the precise control of coordination environment tuning and electro-catalytic activity manipulation. Here, &lt;i&gt;s-p&lt;/i&gt; orbital overlap degree (OOD) between the &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of Na in NaPSs and the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;block C-SACs is proposed as a descriptor for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR). Compared to NG and NG-supported InN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (NG-InN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) SACs, the nitrogen-doped graphene-supported InN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (NG-InN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) SACs show the largest &lt;i&gt;s-p&lt;/i&gt; OOD, demonstrating the weakest shuttle effect and the lowest reaction energy barriers in both SRR and SOR. Accordingly, the designed catalysts allow the Na&#8722;S pouch batteries to retain a high capacity of 490.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a Coulombic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4.5&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work offers an &lt;i&gt;s-p&lt;/i&gt; orbital overlap descriptor describing the interaction between NaPSs and &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;orbital-dominated catalysts for high-performance RT Na&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascade Reaction Enables Heterointerfaces&#8208;Enriched Nanoarrays for Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative cascade reaction in a molten salt environment to synthesize heterostructure nanoarrays, enhancing hydrogen production. Using nickel foam, transition metal salts and potassium thiocyanate, it develops catalysts with superior interfaces that significantly improve electrochemical activity and stability under high current densities.







Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability is essential for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Heterostructure nanoarrays are promising candidates, though achieving both high activity and stability simultaneously, especially under high current densities, remains challenging. To this end, we have developed a cascade reaction process that constructs a series of heterostructure nanoarrays with rich heterointerfaces. This process involves treating nickel foam (NF) with molten KSCN and transition metal salts. Initially, NF reacts with KSCN to form Ni9S8 nanoarrays and S2&#8722; ions, which are subsequently captured by transition metal ions to form sulfides that are directly integrated onto the nanoarrays, resulting in abundant heterointerfaces. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that these rich heterointerfaces significantly enhance the interfacial interaction between Ni9S8 and RuS2 within the nanoarrays (termed RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2), markedly improving both the intrinsic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, the RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2 demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving a low overpotential of just 180&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for up to 500&#8197;h under such high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. This innovative approach paves the way for the interfacial design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ampere&#8208;level hydrogen production.

         <title>Breaking Performance Barriers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) Analogs by Functional Group Self&#8208;Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel KBBF&#8208;analog arsenates, CsAs2O3Br and CsAs4O6Br, have been successfully synthesized via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. These compounds set a new benchmark among KBBF&#8208;like materials, exhibiting extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (20.5&#215; KDP for CsAs2O3Br) and large uniaxial birefringence (0.26@546&#8197;nm for CsAs4O6Br), breaking performance barriers for KBBF analogs.







Abstract
Enhancing the conversion efficiency of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers through the rational design of crystal materials with superior linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a novel approach to optimizing these properties in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF)&#8208;analog crystals via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. This strategy led to the synthesis of two new optical crystals: noncentrosymmetric CsAs2O3Br and centrosymmetric CsAs4O6Br. By incorporating highly optically active [AsO3]3&#8722; units into the classical 2D [Be2BO3F]&#8734;&#8722; framework, we facilitated the self&#8208;assembly of [As2O3]&#8734; layers, forming a densely packed and highly ordered structure that enhances macroscopic optical activity. CsAs2O3Br exhibited an extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, 20.5 times stronger than KH2PO4 (KDP), while CsAs4O6Br demonstrated exceptional birefringence (0.26 at 546&#8197;nm), setting new performance benchmarks among KBBF analogs. Theoretical analyses reveal that these superior properties arise from the efficient alignment and high density of self&#8208;polymerized functional units. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of high&#8208;performance UV NLO materials, particularly for fourth&#8208;harmonic generation, and paves the way for future innovations in photonic technologies, including solar&#8208;blind UV laser systems and advanced photonic devices.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks on Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The TpPa&#8208;COF enriched with &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine has been in situ grown on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNT) via a simple solvothermal method, which can activate numerous K+ storage sites. Enol&#8208;keto tautomerism reinforces the structural stability and improves K+ adsorption capability. The obtained TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables exhibit outstanding potassium storage performance, with high reversible capacity, excellent rate property, and ultralong cycling stability.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising organic electrodes in many electrochemical devices. However, their inherently low conductivity significantly hinders the full utilization of their internal redox&#8208;active sites. To address this issue, a simple solvothermal method is used to in situ polymerize 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PA) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), generating a nanocable&#8208;like COF&#8208;based nanocomposite, TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables, which contain abundant &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine groups. By combining the high specific surface area and dense active sites of COFs with the superior conductivity of CNTs, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries displayed excellent performance. The reason is that the isomerization between the enolic and keto forms reinforces the stability of molecular architecture, while the transformation of active sites from C=N to C=O improves the K+ adsorption capability. Notably, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocable anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 446.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains 282.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after 2000&#8197;cycles at a higher current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a full battery assembled with 3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride heat&#8208;treated at 450&#8201;&#176;C as the cathode retains a reversible capacity of 273.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

Additionally, a full battery assembled with 3,4,9,10-Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride heat-treated at 450&#8201;&#176;C as the cathode retains a reversible capacity of 273.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Enzyme&#8208;Electrocatalyst Cascade Modified Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Methanol Formation from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the development of technologies for the conversion of excess atmospheric CO2, a hybrid electrocatalytic/bioelectrocatalytic system combining an inorganic catalyst with a bienzymatic cascade for CO2 electroreduction to methanol is presented. The Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 electrocatalyst enables the selective conversion of CO2 to formate. The generated formate is subsequently converted in a two&#8208;step process catalyzed by the two NADH&#8208;dependent enzymes, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, via formaldehyde to methanol. NADH regeneration is ensured by diaphorase wired to the electrode by a redox polymer.







Abstract
We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxidized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene&#8208;based low&#8208;potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using highly oxygen&#8208;sensitive formate dehydrogenases by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Kinetically Stabilized Dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;Indacene: Stable Kekul&#233; Diradical Polycyclic Hydrocarbon with Triplet Ground State</title>

         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized and isolated a stable triplet&#8208;ground&#8208;state Kekul&#233; diradical polycyclic hydrocarbon &#8211; a kinetically blocked derivative of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. Its triplet ground state was unequivocally confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements, and its structure and electronic properties were revealed. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion were also studied.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) hold significant potential in organic spintronics and organic magnets. However, their synthesis is very challenging due to their extremely high reactivity. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of a kinetically blocked derivative (1) of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene, which represents a rare persistent triplet diradical of a Kekul&#233; PH. Its triplet ground state was unambiguously confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements. Its structure was also unequivocally confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. The key design principle is to extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation for achieving the decrease of the bonding interaction and the increase of the exchange interaction between unpaired electrons, which are essential for accessing the stable triplet ground state. Due to kinetic blocking, 1 shows a reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of 64&#8197;h under ambient conditions. It has a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. Notably, its dication and dianion exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state and near&#8208;infrared absorption, and the structures were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. This study will shed new light on the design and synthesis of novel stable PHs with high&#8208;spin multiplicity.

         <title>Photosynthesis of H2O2 using Phenothiazine&#8208;Based Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mimicking Coenzyme Q</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report COFs based on oxidized phenothiazine to emulate Coenzyme Q, enhancing charge transfer and H2O2 synthesis efficiency. The PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF showed a 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 synthesis rate, a 720&#8201;% improvement over PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, reaching 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio. In situ characterizations and simulations confirmed three H2O2 evolution pathways, advancing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking.







Abstract
Mimicking natural enzymes through artificial enzyme engineering represents a powerful strategy to fine&#8208;tune the performance of photocatalysts, while the manipulation of electron transfer systems through atomic precision control is challenging. Herein, we reported a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on progressively oxidized phenothiazine (PTH) core as the platform for emulating Coenzyme Q, achieved through meticulous stepwise adjustments of their redox states. Compared to the original PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, the COFs with incrementally oxidized sulfur sites exhibited enhanced charge transfer efficiencies, facilitating efficient electron donation to O2 and thereby providing a favorable pathway for H2O2 synthesis. Notably, the PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF achieved a remarkable synthesis rate of 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, marking a 720&#8201;% improvement over the PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF baseline. Furthermore, upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio, this rate soared to an impressive 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing the most reported photo&#8208;active COFs. In situ characterizations and simulations verified that three H2O2 evolution pathways (2e&#8722; ORR, 4e&#8722; OER, and 4e&#8722; ORR) all involved in the H2O2 production process. As a result, our findings introduce a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through the innovative application of artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking techniques.

         <title>Precise Supramolecular Nanoarchitectonics for Simultaneous Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis in a Co&#8208;Assembly by a Biomimetic Isolation&#8208;Conduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of photoluminescence and photocatalysis have been achieved simultaneously in a co&#8208;assembly by a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy based on arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interactions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly has been exploited to build a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system for real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA) and photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Limited by the two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers, achieving photoluminescence and photocatalysis simultaneously is extremely challenging but essential for ever&#8208;growing complex issues and specialized scenarios. Here we proposed a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy induced by an arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interaction for enabling photoluminescence and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in the co&#8208;assembly of aromatic monomers and octafluoronapthalene (OFN). Inspired by the isolation&#8208;conduction effect of periodic isolation of myelin sheaths on the axons of vertebrate nerve fibers by node of Ranvier, we use OFN as a molecular isolator embedded in the aromatic monomers array to block the singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet pathway, while the enlarged intermolecular dipoles resulting from the A&#8722;P interactions facilitate the conduction of photogenerated carriers in the isolated regions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly exhibits an enhanced monomeric green emission compared to the corresponding monocomponent self&#8208;assembly with weak red emission. Meanwhile, it also has an enhanced photocatalytic HER performance with a rate of 2.45&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 15.2&#8197;times more than the self&#8208;assembled one. On this basis, a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system that includes real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids and photocatalytic HER device is constructed.

         <title>Simultaneous High Current Density and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 through Intermediate Balancing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative CuBIM catalyst has a remarkable CH4 formation rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;% at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH. The distant Cu&#8722;Cu sites (~5.7&#8197;&#197;) in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer favor multistep *CO hydrogenation, and the proper ratio of CuO component ensures adequate *H supply, enabling high current density and highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 is promising for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage but confronts low CH4 selectivity, especially at high current densities. The key challenge lies in promoting *CO intermediate and *H coupling while minimizing side reactions including C&#8722;C coupling and H&#8722;H coupling, which is particularly difficult at high current density due to abundant intermediates. Here we report a cooperative strategy to address this challenge using Cu&#8208;based catalysts comprising Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer and CuO component that can simultaneously manage the key intermediates *CO and *H. A fast CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations show that the increased Cu&#8722;Cu distance in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer component favors multistep *CO hydrogenation over the dimerization, and the CuO component ensures an adequate supply of *H, together contributing to the selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion at high current densities. This work develops a cooperative strategy for the electrosynthesis of CH4 with simultaneous high current density and high selectivity by rational catalyst design, paving the way for its applications.

South Africa's rich natural resources fuelled its industrialisation but are marred by its colonial past. Despite 30&#8197;years of democracy, deep inequalities remain, with infectious diseases disproportionately affecting disadvantaged communities. Chemistry and biomedical research can help to address these challenges. This Viewpoint advocates for chemistry&#8208;driven advancements tailored to South Africa's socioeconomic needs to improve healthcare and economic outcomes.







Abstract
South Africa's rich natural resources remain a key driver of its chemical industrialisation but are tainted and constrained by its complex colonial history. Thirty years since the advent of democracy in South Africa, deep sociopolitical inequalities are amplified by an intolerable infectious disease burden amongst disadvantaged communities. In that respect, South Africa shares challenges with many other nations in the Global South; there are limited opportunities for the economic development and growth needed to uplift all strata of society. This Viewpoint examines the role of the chemical sciences in South Africa's unique history and the current state of its academic and industrial sectors, with a focus on the intersection of chemistry, healthcare and biomedical research. We argue that the opportunities offered through chemistry research and development, including local manufacturing, should be exploited and that scientific advancements should be tailored to and integrated with the socioeconomic realities of South Africa for an effective and multidisciplinary approach to improving healthcare outcomes. This Viewpoint aims to inspire a renewed focus on the pivotal role of chemical scientists and their broader societal contributions to combating the country's infectious disease burden and shaping a healthier future for South Africa.

Mechanics&#8211;photophysics correlation in tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived roomtemperature phosphorescence ionogels is deciphered by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). In their Research Article (e202419114), Y. Tang et al. utilize DMA to explore the relationship between the mechanical and photophysical properties and explain it using two special temperatures (Tloss and Tg). Such a method shows the merits of immediate indication of performance toward ionogels, like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking visual senses with the tactile senses.

Diverse chirality evolution originating from the same building blocks can be simultaneously triggered, as demonstrated by Chuanliang Feng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202417876). The study highlights the construction of supramolecular networks composed of M&#8208; and P&#8208;type nanofibers through the self&#8208;assembly of homochiral phenylalanine derivatives. The cover illustration symbolizes this phenomenon, depicting flowers with opposite chirality, all blossoming simultaneously from the same seeds.

         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation via co&#8208;crystallization of stereodynamic planar chiral pillar[5]arene and polyethylene glycol is reported by Tomoki Ogoshi et al. in their Research Article (e202420115). In the image, the bracelet represents the polypseudorotaxane, with blue and red stones depicting the pS and pR forms of the pillar[5]arene ring, respectively. The crystals between the stones imply the crystallization method. As the number of stones increases, the possible combinations multiply, making selection more difficult, but ultimately, you will find the bracelet that suits you best.

         <dc:description>
The structural motifs and interaction patterns of four different isomers of ethanol trimer were identified by their rotational spectra aided by extensive quantum chemical calculations, as reported by M. Eugenia Sanz et al. in their Research Article (e202415229). Higher&#8208;energy ethanol conformers are predominant in the observed clusters but there is no homochirality synchronization. This study provides insight into the aggregation of an archetypal alcohol.

Ultrasensitive characterization of native bacterial biofilm: A high&#8208;sensitivity dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR method illuminates the composition of intact native bacterial biofilm. The DNP sensitivity boost (~75&#8208;fold) allows observing NMR signals of biofilms composed of bacteria and extracellular matrix at natural abundance, shown here for Pseudomonas. Chemical identification quantifies the biofilm components, as reported by &#220;mit Akbey et^^al. in their Research Article (e202418146).

         <title>Frontispiece: Improving Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin with Triethanolamine as a CO2 Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to improve carbon dioxide delivery in solutions for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is reported by Xue&#8208;Peng Zhang, Rui Cao et al. in their Communication (e202500154). By shuttling CO2 with triethanolamine, which can capture CO2 to form zwitterionic alkylcarbonate and release the bound CO2 at catalytic Fe tetraphenylporphyrin sites, the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity can be significantly increased.

         <title>Fluorescent Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides a comprehensive summary of the synthesis, properties, and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes (FMAs) composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons that have emerged in the past decade. The FMAs are categorized on the basis of the different building blocks incorporated.







Abstract
Fluorescent macrocyclic arenes have attracted increasing interest in macrocyclic and supramolecular chemistry due to their exceptional photophysical properties and versatile applications. Classical macrocyclic arenes modified with fluorescent groups at the upper or bottom rims have long provided valuable platforms across various fields. Recently, a large number of novel fluorescent macrocyclic arenes directly composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic building blocks including naphthalene, anthracene, tetraphenylethene, pyrene, fluorene, carbazole, acridan, phenothiazine, coumarin, triphenylamine, benzothiadiazole and so on, have been reported, and they have shown specific fluorescent property, and also exhibited broad applications in molecular recognition, sensing, bioimaging and functional materials. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes containing polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons emerged in the past decade. By categorizing these fluorescent macrocyclic arenes based on the different building blocks, this review provides a comprehensive summary of their synthesis, properties and applications.

         <title>Functional Polyolefins and Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

Creating functional polyolefins using customized units has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes the application of functional units such as comonomers, chain transfer agents, post&#8208;polymerization modification reagents, and functional fillers for preparing functional polyolefins and composites.







Abstract
Polyolefins are simple hydrocarbons that require additional chemical modifications or functional additives to give them custom functions. Recent research in the development of functional polyolefins has surpassed the traditional approach of simply improving surface properties by incorporating polar moieties. Creating custom functionalized polyolefins by using specific functional units has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes advances in preparing custom functionalized polyolefin materials using functional units such as comonomers, chain&#8208;transfer agents, post&#8208;polymerization modification reagents, and functional fillers. Exploring new functional units and innovative synthetic strategies will further enhance the performance and expand the applications of functional polyolefins.

This minireview introduces the photothermal mechanisms of 2D nanomaterials, preparation and regulation strategies, and systematically summarizes the latest advancements in photothermal therapy using 2D nanomaterials for various diseases. It also explores some significant breakthroughs in the field of combination therapy.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials offer a transformative platform for photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their unique physicochemical properties and exceptional photothermal conversion efficiencies. This Minireview summarizes the photothermal mechanisms of common 2D nanomaterials and details their synthesis, surface modification, and optimization strategies. Recent advances leveraging 2D nanomaterials for enhanced PTT are highlighted, with particular emphasis on synergistic therapeutic modalities. Despite the significant potential of 2D nanomaterials in PTT, challenges persist, including scalable and reproducible manufacturing, precise targeted delivery, understanding of the underlying biological interactions, and comprehensive assessment of long&#8208;term biocompatibility and toxicity. Looking forward, emerging technologies such as machine learning are expected to play a crucial role in accelerating the design and optimization of 2D nanomaterials for PTT, enabling the prediction of optimal structures, properties, and therapeutic efficacy, and ultimately paving the way for personalized nanomedicine.

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters as Highly Efficient, Versatile Type&#8208;II Photoinitiators via Generating Radicals from Non&#8208;Conventional Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that metal nanoclusters can function as highly efficient, versatile type&#8208;II photoinitiators via generating various types of non&#8208;conventional thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. Discovery of this underlying photochemcial process could open the door of applying metal nanoclusters in photolithography and other emerging applications using inexpensive light sources with low intensities.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient photocatalysis or photoinitiation systems that are applicable to various types of illumination source is critical to virtually all the light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we report a generalizable strategy to achieve highly sensitive, versatile photoinitiation systems based on the combination of metal nanoclusters with non&#8208;conventional hydrogen donors (co&#8208;initiators). Discovery of this type&#8208;II photoinitiation pathway in metal nanoclusters not only improves their two&#8208;photon initiation sensitivity by up to three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude, it further opens the door for metal nanoclusters to trigger the photopolymerization using the low&#8208;power UV light&#8208;emitting diodes. Different from molecular type&#8208;II photoinitiators, we found that the selection rules of hydrogen donors for metal nanoclusters are largely dependent on their ligand structures. More importantly, using electron paramagnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy, we for the first time demonstrate that the photoexcited metal nanoclusters can function as versatile hydrogen atom abstractors which generate various types of previously unreported thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. This finding indicates the broad opportunity of the future application of metal nanoclusters in light&#8208;driven organic synthesis and radical chemistry.

         <title>Thermally Induced Reversible Martensitic Phase Transition and Self&#8208;Healing in Nickel Glycinamide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A martensitic&#8208;type polymorphic transition accompanied by self&#8208;healing was observed in a nickel coordination compound. A single crystal is transformed into a two&#8208;component twinned crystal in a reversible twinning/detwinning thermally induced polymorphic transition. The coexistence of both polymorphs was observed within the same crystal, and the cracks heal upon the reversible transition.







Abstract
Martensitic phase transitions and self&#8208;healing in molecular compounds are extremely rare, and while they carry potential for rapid energy transduction, they are currently found only by serendipity. Here, we report the observation of both phenomena in a coordination compound of glycinamide (Glyam), [Ni(H2O)2(Glyam)2]I2 (1). Upon cooling to 205&#8211;213&#8197;K, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph of this material (1RT) transforms into twinned crystals of the low&#8208;temperature polymorph (1LT(twinned)), while upon heating, it is converted back to 1RT in the temperature range 217&#8211;223&#8197;K. When this transformation occurs in single crystals, evolution of cracks is observed upon cooling that disappear upon heating. The forward transition 1RT&#8594;1LT(twinned) is completed in a few seconds, while the reverse one, 1LT(twinned)&#8594;1RT, proceeds up to several hours, contrary to the fast transition in polycrystalline samples. We determined the concomitant presence of 1RT and 1LT(twinned) in the same single crystal. The crystal structure analysis revealed complex inter&#8208; and intramolecular displacements of atoms during the transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report where a thermally induced reversible martensitic phase transition and self&#8208;healing are observed in crystals of a coordination compound, and indicates the potential generality of these extraordinary phenomena.

         <title>Barrierless Electron Transfer in a Photosynthetic Reaction Center Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast IR absorption spectroscopy was utilized to interrogate excited&#8208;state electron transfer in a strongly&#8208;coupled, cyanide&#8208;bridged photoinduced mixed&#8208;valent system. Despite structural asymmetry, a flat excited&#8208;state potential energy surface with a single minimum was found, showing a Class&#8197;III behavior. These findings were supported by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy is the ultimate tool to reveal whether any donor&#8208;acceptor system is truly delocalized and therefore characterized by a single&#8208;welled potential energy surface, or if it is marginally localized with a barrier that defines two minima. Our femtosecond IR absorption investigations on cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed valence systems show a broad, intense and downshifted CN vibration signature, revealing, for the first time, an asymmetric, fully delocalized Class III photoinduced mixed valence system.

         <title>Surface&#8208;like NOx Reduction at an Atomically&#8208;Precise Tricopper Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report catalytic total denitrification of nitric oxide (NO) at a surface&#8208;like tricopper cluster complex. This process is shown to proceed via an oxygen atom transfer pathway that leverages the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity of the polynuclear core. Stoichiometric deoxygenation of nitrite and nitrate are also demonstrated, mapping out the complete denitrification cycle.







Abstract
The combustion of nitrogen&#8208;containing fuels and increasing use of nitrogen&#8208;rich fertilizers is accumulating NOx pollutants in the environment. Copper is an attractive catalyst material for reductive NOx remediation, yet ambiguity persists regarding the elementary bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps occurring at the catalyst interface. Starting from a molecular tricuprous &#956;3&#8208;oxo complex (1), an unusually reduced and highly reactive surface&#8208;like cluster (2) has been prepared. Characterization data and electronic structure calculations are consistent with 2 featuring &#963;&#8208;aromaticity that primes the tricopper core for two&#8208;electron chemistry. Cluster 2 mediates catalytic reductive coupling of NO to N2, proceeding through N2O, via sequential oxygen atom transfer steps. Stoichiometric reduction of NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; is also disclosed, mapping the complete denitrification cycle at an atomically&#8208;precise molecular cluster.

Halogenated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (HDACs) are presented as viable surrogates for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) cyclopropenes. Upon cycloaddition with a variety of 2&#960;&#8208;components, spontaneous elimination of HX occurs, giving rise to the products of a formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition to a (D&#8722;A) cyclopropene. Six types of cycloaddition reactions are presented using HDACs and a kinetic study was undertaken to gain further understanding of this reactivity.







Abstract
Herein we report (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of halogenated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (HDACs) as surrogates for donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropenes. Upon reaction with a variety of 2&#960;&#8208;components, cycloaddition followed by elimination generates the unsaturated five&#8208;membered ring products. A series of HDACs were shown to be effective in reactions with thioketones. Five further cycloaddition reactions were used to showcase the broad applicability of these donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropene surrogates. Kinetic studies allowed the proposal of a plausible mechanism for this reaction.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin with Triethanolamine as a CO2 Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of Fe porphyrins can be significantly enhanced with triethanolamine, which can function as a CO2 shuttle to capture CO2 and bring it to the Fe porphyrin site for binding and activation. The unique tripodal structure of triethanolamine is essential for capturing CO2 to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate. This work is significant to present a new strategy to promote the activation of CO2 in solutions.







Abstract
Delivering CO2 molecules to catalyst sites is a vital step in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Achievements have been made to develop efficient catalysts, but few efforts have been dedicated to improving CO2 delivering in solutions. Herein, we report on electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion using Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) as a catalyst and triethanolamine as a CO2 shuttle. Compared to ethanol, the electrocatalytic CO2RR current with triethanolamine increases by more than three times. We show that triethanolamine can effectively capture a CO2 molecule to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate through the collaboration between its tripodal alcohol and amine units. This alkylcarbonate can release the bound CO2 molecule for activation at the Fe site upon its interaction with FeTPP. In addition to shuttling CO2, alkylcarbonates can also provide protons to assist the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Therefore, this work is significant to demonstrate a new strategy to improve electrocatalytic CO2RR by shuttling CO2.

         <title>Selective and Potent Molecular Glue Degraders for NIMA&#8208;Related Kinase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first well&#8208;characterized and selective NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) molecular glue degrader LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 was developed. By degrading NEK7 protein, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 deactivated the NLRP3 inflammasome and showed potent inhibitory effects on the release of the downstream cytokines.







Abstract
Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation within cells. While chemoproteomics has unveiled hundreds of potential MGD targets, very few proteins are degraded by highly selective and potent MGDs. Here, we developed a novel glutarimide analog with a tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine scaffold that exhibited strong NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) degradation potential. Further optimization led to the identification of LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 as a leading NEK7 MGD candidate, demonstrating potent activity with a half&#8208;maximal degradation (DC50) of 7&#8197;nM and a maximum degradation (Dmax) of 90&#8201;% in MOLT&#8208;4 cells. Notably, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 displayed high selectivity for NEK7 across the proteome. Mechanistic studies indicated that the degradation was mediated by the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) and relied on the glycine 57 (G57)&#8208;containing degron motif in NEK7. Additionally, two amino acids adjacent to the degron motif were found to be crucial for modulating the compound's selectivity and potency, underscoring the significance of neighbouring residues in MGD design. Moreover, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 effectively inhibited secretion of the downstream cytokines, including IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;18, highlighting the potential therapeutic applications of NEK7 MGDs in treating inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Constrained Flexibility for Benchmark Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D ligand metal&#8722;organic framework ZUL&#8722;C6 with an alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system, obtains high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving separation for hexane isomer mixtures in a wide pressure range, benefiting from its constrained flexibility which is driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation and distortion of the coordination units with a high deformation energy barrier, achieving benchmark hexane isomer separation performance.Twitter/X handle: vigaryang76749.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for adsorptive separations, but achieving a balance among flexibility, adsorption capacity, and selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel flexible MOF, Ni(bhdc)(ted)0.5 (ZUL&#8722;C6), incorporating hybrid three&#8208;dimensional alkane&#8208;bridged ligands, which realizes high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving for hexane isomer separation &#8208; a critical process in the petroleum industry. The alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system within the ZUL&#8722;C6 framework facilitated a strong affinity for n&#8208;hexane and 3&#8208;methylpentane. However, the narrow pore size and the constrained flexibility limited the uptake of 2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane (&lt;4.0&#8197;mg/g), accompanied by a high gate&#8208;opening pressure. The gating behavior was elucidated by guest&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal (SC) X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which revealed a unique SC to SC transformation driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation of the 3D bhdc linker and distortion of the metal cluster and pillar units, along with a high deformation energy barrier. As a result, ZUL&#8722;C6 exhibited not only significantly higher uptake and selectivity than the industrially used 5&#8197;A molecular sieve, but also the record&#8208;high nHEX/3MP breakthrough uptake (92.8/73.9&#8197;mg/g) and unprecedented 22DMB producing time (309.2&#8197;min/g, corresponding to the productivity of 770&#8197;mmol/kg and yield of 92.8&#8201;%) among reported MOFs.

         <title>Validation and Mechanistic Studies of the Headspace Effect in MOF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a fixed vessel volume, the rate of metal&#8211;organic framework formation is shown to depend on the amount of solution employed. This headspace effect is demonstrated to arise only in the presence of oxygen. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that oxygen reacts with the formamide solvent and contributes to nitrosamine side products.







Abstract
The influence of headspace volume and composition on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthesis has been largely overlooked with no mechanisms currently invoking these factors. Herein, we reveal that an increased volume of oxygen in the headspace during the synthesis of zinc carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs (MOF&#8208;5, MOF&#8208;177, and IRMOF&#8208;8) as well as UiO&#8208;66 and ZJU&#8208;28 accelerates crystal formation. Investigation into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon elucidates the critical roles played by all reagents, and some of their byproducts, in MOF synthesis. These insights are the key to developing more efficient and sustainable synthetic strategies for MOF production.

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of Six Crinipellin&#8208;Type Diterpenoids through Tandem 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization/Dicycloexpansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A more straightforward approach to synthesize densely congested crinipellins has been accomplished in just 9&#8211;11 steps through strategic tandem 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade and a series of highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and diastereoselective late&#8208;stage transformations without using protecting groups.







Abstract
Crinipellins are a significant class of naturally occurring highly congested tetraquinane diterpenoids, with many members exhibiting bio&#8208;important antibacterial and anticancer activities. However, their complex structures, particularly their dense 5/5/5/5 tetracyclic frameworks, have made efficient synthesis challenging, leading chemists to attempt to create highly efficient and divergent routes. This study presents a concise, divergent synthesis of six crinipellins, completed in just 9&#8211;11 steps using commercially available materials. Particular highlights include: (1) a vital one&#8208;step 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade that rapidly constructs the angular/fused tetraquinane scaffold with two contiguous quaternary carbons, and (2) strategic functionalizations through iso&#8208;propylation, methylation, and Wacker oxidation/dehydrogenation, enabling the divergent syntheses of the six crinipellin members without using protecting groups. This approach provides a versatile platform for accessing additional crinipellin derivatives, which we believe will benefit medicinal and biological research.
