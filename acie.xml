         <title>Support&#8208;layer Integrated Zeolite Membranes Through In Situ Interfacial Transformation of Clay&#8208;based Protomembranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite membranes are considered ideal inorganic membrane materials for separating mixtures with molecular&#8208;level differences. However, their complex preparation process with excessive synthesis solutions for traditional hydrothermal heating methods leads to various drawbacks. Here, we describe a membrane preparation strategy involving an in situ interfacial transformation of the protomembrane without solvents. Inexpensive clay powder forms the protomembrane, and the active ingredients subsequently migrate from the interior of this protomembrane to its surface and transform into a zeolite layer. Ultimately, the protomembrane is calcined to obtain the support&#8208;layer integrated zeolite membrane. Systematic research shows that clay not only serves as a raw material for the support but also provides active ingredients for the growth of zeolite crystals; thus, zeolite membranes with zeolite particles inserted into the support are formed. The zeolite membrane calcined at 800&#176;C possesses a p&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene separation factor approaching 6263 with a permeation flux of 1.21&#215;10&#8208;7 mol&#8226;m&#8208;2&#8226;s&#8208;1&#8226;Pa&#8208;1. This interfacial transformation method can be applied to other membranes and promote the development of membrane separation technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Protein Kinases' Cysteinome by Covalent Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases are important drug targets, yet specific inhibitors have been developed for only a fraction of the more than 500 human kinases. A major challenge in designing inhibitors for highly related kinases is selectivity. Unlike their non&#8208;covalent counterparts, covalent inhibitors offer the advantage of selectively targeting structurally similar kinases by modifying specific protein side chains, particularly non&#8208;conserved cysteines. Previously, covalent fragment screens yielded potent and selective compounds for individual kinases such as ERK1/2 but have not been applied to the broader kinome. Furthermore, many of the accessible cysteine positions have not been addressed so far. Here, we outline a generalizable approach to sample ATP&#8208;site cysteines with fragment&#8208;like covalent inhibitors. We present the development of a kinase&#8208;focused fragment library and its systematic screening against a curated selection of 47 kinases, with 60 active site&#8208;proximal cysteines using LC/MS and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays, followed by hit validation through various complementary techniques. Our findings expand the repertoire of targetable cysteines within protein kinases, provide insight into unique binding modes identified from crystal structures and deliver isoform&#8208;specific hits with promising profiles as starting points for the development of highly potent and selective covalent inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Mechanically Interlocked Semi&#8208;Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance polymers based on&#160;dynamic chemistry have been widely explored for multi&#8208;field advanced applications. However, noncovalent sacrifice bond mediated energy dissipation mechanism causes a trade&#8208;off between mechanical toughness and resilience. Herein, we achieved the synchronous boost of seemingly conflicting material properties including mechanical robustness, toughness and elasticity via the incorporation of mechanical chemistry into traditional semi&#8208;crystalline networks. Detailed rheological tests and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the excellent mechanical robustness and toughness are attributed to the dissociation of crystalline domains threading through the sieve&#8208;shape macrocycles. Reversible nano&#8208;crystalline domains and ring&#8208;sliding effect accelerated segment motion efficiently reduce energy dissipation to achieve instantaneous resilience. Moreover, the model polymers demonstrate that the multiple dynamic components endow the resulting polymer with excellent reprocessability under mild conditions. This mechanically interlocked semi&#8208;crystalline polymer exhibits potential application as thermal/photo actuator. This work deeply reveals the synergic effects of mechanically interlocked sites and tunable crystalline domains, thus providing a reliable guide for comprehensive improvement of material performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Epoxidation with Water by Confined Active Co Sites on BiVO4 Photoanodes under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis systems have recently seen significant growth in organic transformations, but are limited by the inherent physicochemical properties of electrode materials. To enhance selectivity in these processes, we propose an innovative advancement in the rational design of photoanodes. Specifically, we incorporated cobalt porphyrin co&#8208;catalysts with confined Co sites onto bismuth vanadate films as a photoanode. This photoanode significantly enhances the efficacy of styrene epoxidation, achieving selectivity and conversion rates of 90% and 99%, respectively. Notably, the reaction utilizes water as the sole oxygen source, operates at room temperature, and is easily scalable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. The developed photoanode demonstrates robust performance across various alkene substrates. Operando characterizations reveal that during the epoxidation reaction, the confined Co sites within the porphyrin structure catalyze the oxidation of H2O to form Co&#8208;O*, serving as critical intermediates that facilitate cyclization reactions via one&#8208;electron processes. This study introduces an innovative heterogeneous PEC strategy with customizable active sites tailored for selective catalytic organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting C2+ Alcohols Selectivity and Activity in High&#8208;Current CO Electroreduction using Synergistic Cu/Zn Co&#8208;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To unify the selectivity and activity of CO electroreduction for C2+ alcohols, a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst was developed to balance the competition between CO reduction and hydrogen evolution on Cu sites. Zn alloying increases CO coverage on Cu and facilitates hydrogen spillover from Zn to Cu, synergistically promoting alcohol formation, achieving a 50&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for alcohol synthesis at a current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, specifically ethanol and n&#8208;propanol through CO electroreduction (CORR) in H2O, presents a sustainable pathway for intermittent renewable energy storage and a low&#8208;carbon economy. However, achieving high selectivity for alcohol production at industrial current densities is kinetically hampered by side reactions such as ethylene generation and hydrogen evolution reaction, which result from competing adsorption of *CO and *H. In this study, we developed a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst to simultaneously enhance the activity and selectivity for alcohol production by increasing CO capture capacity and enriching active hydrogen on Cu sites. Our findings demonstrate that the Cu/5Zn alloy with a molar ratio of Cu to Zn of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 50&#8201;% for the selective electrosynthesis of C2+ alcohols during ampere&#8208;level CO electrolysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the Cu/Zn alloy promotes polarized Cu sites, enhancing CO adsorption while facilitating the spillover of hydrogen atoms from Zn to Cu sites, contributing to selective alcohol formation.

         <title>A Highly Biocompatible Polyoxotungstate with Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Activity for Potent Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyoxotungstate has been made and found to show excellent solubility, stability, and biocompatibility in aqueous solutions and physiological conditions. Remarkably, it can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, and thus exhibit high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells. Moreover, it exhibits excellent antitumor efficacy with good biosafety against melanoma growth in vivo. This makes it a promising candidate as a cancer chemodynamic therapy agent







Abstract
Integrating Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy has significantly promoted the development of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs), with their reversible redox properties, exhibit promising potential in developing outstanding CDT drugs by exploring their Fenton&#8208;like catalytic reactivity in tumor environments. However, such research is still in its infancy due to the challenges of acquiring POMs that are both easily prepared and possess ideal therapeutic effects, physiological solubility, biocompatibility and safety. In this work, we report the synthesis of a new crystalline antimonotungstate {Dy2Sb2W7O23(OH)(DMF)2(SbW9O33)2} (1, DMF=N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide) with gram&#8208;scale high yield via a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal reaction. 1 exhibits not only a soluble and water&#8208;stable POM nanocluster, but also excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyl radical&#8208;generating Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Further biomedical studies reveal that 1 can trigger cell apoptosis and promote lipid peroxidation, exhibiting high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells with an IC50 value of 4.75&#8197;&#956;M. Especially, 1 can inhibit melanoma growth in vivo with favorable biosafety, achieving a 5.2&#8208;fold reduction in tumor volume and a weight loss of 76.0&#8201;% at the dose of 70&#8197;&#956;g/kg. This research not only demonstrates the immense potential of antimonotungstates in CDT drug development for the first time but also provides new insights and directions for the development of novel anticancer drugs.

     alt="A Highly Biocompatible Polyoxotungstate with Fenton-like Reaction Activity for Potent Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new polyoxotungstate has been made and found to show excellent solubility, stability, and biocompatibility in aqueous solutions and physiological conditions. Remarkably, it can catalyze the decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, and thus exhibit high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16-F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells. Moreover, it exhibits excellent antitumor efficacy with good biosafety against melanoma growth &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. This makes it a promising candidate as a cancer chemodynamic therapy agent
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy has significantly promoted the development of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs), with their reversible redox properties, exhibit promising potential in developing outstanding CDT drugs by exploring their Fenton-like catalytic reactivity in tumor environments. However, such research is still in its infancy due to the challenges of acquiring POMs that are both easily prepared and possess ideal therapeutic effects, physiological solubility, biocompatibility and safety. In this work, we report the synthesis of a new crystalline antimonotungstate {Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(DMF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SbW&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, DMF=N, N-dimethylformamide) with gram-scale high yield via a facile &#8220;one-pot&#8221; solvothermal reaction. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits not only a soluble and water-stable POM nanocluster, but also excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyl radical-generating Fenton-like reactions. Further biomedical studies reveal that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can trigger cell apoptosis and promote lipid peroxidation, exhibiting high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16-F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 4.75&#8197;&#956;M. Especially, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can inhibit melanoma growth &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with favorable biosafety, achieving a 5.2-fold reduction in tumor volume and a weight loss of 76.0&#8201;% at the dose of 70&#8197;&#956;g/kg.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe2 and Ni Sites for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst Fe2/Ni&#8722;N&#8722;HCMs composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (Fe2&#8722;N6 and Ni&#8722;N4) coordinated onto hollow N&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is synthesized by a simple process. Because of the synergistic effects of the two groups, the catalysts electrocatalyze the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions effectively through a dual&#8208;site mechanism, promoting direct O&#8722;O radical breakage without going through *OOH intermediates, enabling a zinc&#8208;air battery to perform superbly.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, a new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2&#8722;N6 and Ni&#8722;N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2&#8722;N6 or Ni&#8722;N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in&#8197;situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2&#8722;N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d&#8208;band centers by the Ni&#8722;N4 sites. This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst can potentially be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based catalysts to drive both the ORR and the OER in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and other related applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Golden Fullerene Au42 with Unprecedented Metal Coordination Number of 15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;golden fullerene&#8221; Au42 cluster topologically related to D3h C78 has a centered core&#8211;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26 featuring record high metal coordination number of 15. Its excellent stability is attributed to both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.







Abstract
A golden fullerene with a composition of [Au42(Ph3P)10(5&#8208;CF3&#8208;Hpa)8] (CF3COO)2 (5&#8208;CF3&#8208;H2pa=5&#8208;trifluoropyridyl&#8208;2&#8208;amine) (Au42) has been synthesized with pyridylamino and phosphine ligands as the protecting agents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that the cluster has a D3h Au4210+ core, which can be depicted as a centered core&#8211;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26. The 41 Au atoms of the Au15@Au26 core&#8211;shell can be derived from placing a gold atom in the center of each polygon of C78 (D3h). Surprisingly, the centered gold atom of this noble cluster has the highest coordination number in metal nanoclusters of 15. Quantum&#8208;chemical studies suggest that the excellent stability of Au42 results from both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.

         <title>Non&#8208;Radical Mediated Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Conjugate&#8208;Enhanced Phenolic Resins with Ultrafast Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur&#8208;infused phenolic (RS) resin photocatalyst was meticulously designed at the molecular level to fine&#8208;tune its conjugation degree, thereby enhancing both its charge separation capability and hydrophilicity. This structural optimization enables the RS resin to achieve overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via non&#8208;radical pathways, resulting in an outstanding solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
It is essential for the development of highly efficient polymeric photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Nevertheless, the non&#8208;uniform molecular structures and sluggish reaction pathway of polymeric photocatalysts lead to low conversion efficiency. In this work, we report sulfur&#8208;contained phenolic resins with regulated conjugation for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Due to the substitution of sulfur for methylene in the phenolic resin structure, the conjugation degree of the material is adjusted, resulting in the formation of a built&#8208;in electric field. This effectively enhances the charge separation capability, enabling charge carriers to react faster with substrates. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we have unveiled that the introduction of sulfur can modulate the reaction pathway of phenolic resin materials, enabling a dual&#8208;pathway photocatalytic H2O2 production mediated by non&#8208;radical species. Impressively, the sulfur&#8208;contained resin photocatalyst showcases exceptional H2O2 production activity with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4&#8201;% exceeding most reported systems, and generates 25&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 of H2O2 under natural sunlight through large&#8208;scale equipment. This work provides a facile strategy to separate the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs of polymer photocatalysts to achieve efficient artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Engineering the Self&#8208;Assembly Pathways of POSS&#8208;Peptide Amphiphiles to Form Diverse Cross&#8208;&#946; Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A POSS&#8208;peptide amphiphile was constructed by conjugating cross&#8208;&#946; peptide with hydrophilic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). A single molecule unveils two distinctive transition pathways depending on water content. The POSS directs the unusual transition from the twisted to flat nanoribbons (pathway 2), which distinguishes it from the prevalently observed pathway 1 in &#946;&#8208;sheet forming peptide systems.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;&#946; structures are crucial in driving protein folding and aggregation. However, due to their strong aggregating tendency, the precise control of the self&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides remains a challenge. We propose a molecular geometry strategy to study and control the self&#8208;assembly of cross&#8208;&#946; structures. We conjugate the peptide with shape&#8208;persistent polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), which acts as a hydrophilic head and senses the solvent environment. The POSS&#8208;peptide amphiphiles display two distinct self&#8208;assembly pathways: twisted nanoribbons transforming into either nanotubes at low water content or flat nanoribbons at high water content. The peptide packing in flat nanoribbons is predominantly modulated by POSS, diverting the system away from crystal formation, which is the absolute lowest energy state of pure peptide self&#8208;assemblies. For the first time, we have demonstrated that POSS can serve as a useful tool to adjust the interactions between cross&#8208;&#946; strands, achieving fine&#8208;tuning of the pathway complexity (i.e., the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of peptide self&#8208;assembly). With this versatile molecular platform incorporating multiple functionalities of POSS and programable peptide sequences, this study provides a platform to exploit cross&#8208;&#946;&#8208;based nanomaterials with functional and pathological significance.

&lt;p&gt;A POSS-peptide amphiphile was constructed by conjugating cross-&#946; peptide with hydrophilic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). A single molecule unveils two distinctive transition pathways depending on water content. The POSS directs the unusual transition from the twisted to flat nanoribbons (pathway 2), which distinguishes it from the prevalently observed pathway 1 in &#946;-sheet forming peptide systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>C&#8208;H Bond Activation by Sulfated Zirconium Oxide is Mediated by a Sulfur&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfated zirconium oxide (SZO) catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of isotactic polypropylene (iPP,&#160;Mn&#160;= 13.3 kDa,&#160;&#272;&#160;= 2.4, &lt;mmmm&gt; = 94 %) or high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE,&#160;Mn&#160;= 2.5 kDa,&#160;&#272;&#160;= 3.6) to branched alkanes. We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites&#160;SZO, which open under mild reaction conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO3&#160;and sulfate. This adsorbed SO3&#160;is a very strong Lewis acid that binds&#160;15N&#8208;pyridine or triethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (DEads&#160;&gt; &#8211;39 kcal mol&#8208;1), reacts with Ph3CH to form Ph3C+, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene&#8208;d4. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites have a modest 26.1 kcal mol&#8208;1&#160;barrier to form the adsorbed SO3&#160;and sulfate in the presence of a propylene tetramer. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8211;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent&#160;b&#8208;scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO3&#160;between 226.2 to 237.9 kcal mol&#8208;1, among largest values reported for a neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how&#160;SZO, a classic heterogeneous catalyst whose activity is often attributed to Br&#248;nsted acidity, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dual photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protocol for chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and cyclobutenes through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such process represents an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enables selective transformation of the less sterically congested alkenes of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes with cyclobutenes, incorporating a broad scope of tetrasubstituted alkenes into the cyclobutane scaffolds in up to 86% yield, &gt;98:2 chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, &gt;98:2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydroxylation and Oxidative Coupling Reactions Mediated by Multinuclear Au(I) Supramolecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polynuclear Au(I) cluster photocatalysts, known for their high activity and stability, hold substantial potential in organic synthetic chemistry. This study synthesized two Au(I) supramolecular cluster catalysts with different nuclearities: a tetranuclear cluster, C1&#160;([(dppmAu2)2L1]&#8226;PF6&#713;), and a hexadecanuclear cluster, C2&#160;[(dppmAu2)6(Au4)(L1)4]&#8226;4PF6&#713;, through a multicomponent stepwise self&#8208;assembly approach. Both cluster structures feature aurophilicity interaction motifs that endow them with exceptional photocatalytic performance, exhibiting optical band&#160;gaps of 2.27 eV and 2.41 eV, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, these clusters efficiently generate reactive oxygen species, significantly enhancing their photocatalytic efficacy for the oxidative hydroxylation of phenylboronic acids and oxidative coupling of benzylamines under mild conditions. Catalytic efficiencies exceeding 90% were achieved. Turnover frequencies for C2&#160;and C1&#160;were measured at 52.045 h&#8208;1&#160;and 6.030 h&#8208;1, respectively, representing the highest efficiencies reported for photocatalysts to date. Compared to C1, C2&#160;exhibited superior photocatalytic activity, attributed to its higher photoelectric sensitivity and greater exposure of active metal sites. Using a combination of experimental data and density functional theory&#160;calculations, the plausible mechanisms were proposed for two photocatalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that the use of&#160;multicomponent cooperative self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize high&#8208;nuclearity Au(I) clusters offers innovative pathways for the development of efficient, green, light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Propane Activation on Pt Electrodes at Room Temperature: Quantification of Adsorbate Identity and Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8212;H bond activation is the first step in manufacturing chemical products from readily available light alkane feedstock and typically proceeds via carbon&#8208;intensive thermal processes. The ongoing emphasis on decarbonization via electrification motivates low&#8208;temperature electrochemical alternatives that could lead to sustainable chemicals production. Platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts have shown activity towards reacting alkanes; however, little is known about propane electrocatalytic activation and conditions suitable for enabling selective oxidation to valuable products. Herein, we utilize a combination of electrochemical mass spectrometry (ECMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the potential dependence of propane activation on Pt electrocatalysts. Results show a strong dependence of adsorption on the applied potential in room&#8208;temperature aqueous acidic electrolyte, with a maximum coverage of propane&#8208;derived adsorbates at 0.30 V vs RHE. Using charge deconvolution and deuterated experiments, the mechanism of adsorption was elucidated, and C3H2* was determined as the average dehydrogenated propane&#8208;derived adsorbate species. DFT calculations further corroborate these results, showing that the formation of deeply dehydrogenated species is energetically accessible at room temperature. The combined theoretical and experimental findings yield insights for selective activation of paraffinic C&#8212;H bonds at room temperature, aqueous conditions &#8211; a critical step towards decarbonized chemical manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Micellar Aggregate Electrolytes Enable Durable Electrochemical Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton electrochemistry holds eminent potential for developing high capacity and rate energy storage devices in the post&#8208;lithium era. However, the decomposition of water in acidic aqueous electrolytes causes electrode corrosion, leading to capacity fading. Herein, we report a judicious design of molecular micellar aggregates as non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for stable and high&#8208;voltage electrochemical proton storage. The key to our strategy lies in introducing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), forming micelles to improve the miscibility of acetonitrile (ACN) and H3PO4, afford channel for proton transport, and electrostatically interact with phosphate ions of H3PO4 to further promote proton transport. Such aggregates impart rapid and stable electrochemical proton storage with a widened operating voltage (1.8 V vs. 1.5 V in aqueous electrolyte). By optimizing CTAB content, proton transport can be enhanced. Asymmetric full proton battery using the optimal CTAB electrolyte achieves a maximum energy density of 102.8 Wh kg&#8208;1 and a maximum power density of 10.1 kW kg&#8208;1. Our simple yet robust route to micellar aggregate electrolytes enables stable proton storage, underscoring its potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, emergency power supplies, and portable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Incorporating 4,5&#8208;Dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of 4,5&#8208;dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene as a central core between two 1,4&#8208;dithiafulvene (DTF) units provides a novel class of extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) electron donors. Herein we present the synthesis of such compounds with the azulenoazulene further expanded by annulation to benzene, naphthalene, or thiophene rings. Moreover, unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with one DTF and one carbonyl at the central core are presented. The effect of the odd&#8208;membered rings of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cores on the geometrical features and the extent of bond conjugation in these systems were investigated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemical studies, X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, and computational studies. Altogether these studies reveal that, upon oxidation, the non&#8208;planar core of the bis(benzo)&#8208;fused dihydro&#8208;azulenoazulene&#8208;extended TTF generates a large 22&#960;&#8208;aromatic system (together with two 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,3&#8208;dithiolium appendages) characterized by significant bond length equalizations. The dication formed by oxidation is EPR silent, indicating a singlet ground state. Computations reveal that the closed&#8208;shell singlet species and its open&#8208;shell singlet counterpart are nearly degenerate and of lower energy than a triplet species. According to cyclic voltammetry, the compounds can be oxidized further and present multi&#8208;redox systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Plasma&#8208;Driven Ammonia Synthesis Using a AuCu3/Cu Composite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green ammonia synthesis using fluctuating renewable energy supply in decentralized process is a goal that has been long sought after. Ammonia synthesis with non&#8208;thermal plasma under mild conditions is a promising technology, but it faces the critical challenge of low energy efficiency. Herein, we develop an easily&#8208;scalable AuCu3/Cu catalyst, which consists of a decimeter&#8208;scale metallic Cu antenna and nano&#8208;scale AuCu3 catalytic sites on metallic Cu surface, significantly enhancing the energy efficiency and ammonia yield in a radio&#8208;frequency (RF) plasma system. Compared to plasma alone, the single&#8208;pass ammonia yield over AuCu3/Cu increases by a factor of 20, approaching 10%. Mechanistic studies indicate that Cu antenna can amplify the millimeter&#8208;scale local electric field, thereby facilitating the generation of active nitrogen species, including nitrogen radicals and vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecules. Due to the downshifted d&#8208;band center and unique Cu&#8208;Au interface structure, the AuCu3 nanoalloy modified on Cu antenna surface significantly reduces hydrogenation barriers of active NHX (x=0,1,2) species (the rate&#8208;determining step) and facilitates ammonia desorption at lower temperature. The synergistic effect of Cu antenna and surface AuCu3 nanoalloy comprehensively enhances ammonia synthesis through both the nitrogen radical&#8208;mediated Eley&#8208;Rideal pathway and the vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecule&#8208;mediated Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperation of Multifunctional Redox Mediator and Separator Modification to Enhance Li&#8208;S Batteries Performance under Low Electrolyte/Sulfur Ratio</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur species fundamentally trigger the incomplete conversion of S8&#8596;Li2S and restricted lifespan of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, especially under high sulfur loading and/or low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Introducing redox mediators (RMs) is an effective strategy to boost the battery reaction kinetics, yet&#160;their multifunctionality and shuttle inhibition are still not available. Here, a unique ethyl viologen (EtV&#178;&#8314;) RM with two highly reversible redox couples (EtV&#178;&#8314;/EtV&#8314;, EtV&#8314;/EtV0) is demonstrated to well match the redox chemistry of sulfur species, in terms of accelerating the electron transfer in S8 reduction, Li2S nucleation and the Li2S oxidation. When coupling with a functionalized separator with electronegative &#8210;SO3Li groups, a synergetic chemistry is established to ensure the substantial inhibition of the shuttle effect and the acceleration of charge transfer. As a result, the activation energies during sulfur species conversion (S8&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;Li2S2/Li2S&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;S8) are decreased, especially for Li2S nucleation step. The correspond lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries achieve a high specific capacity of 1006.9 mAh g&#8208;1 (0.1C; sulfur loading of 5 mg cm&#8208;2; E/S ratio of 6 &#956;L mgs&#8208;1), and an outstanding cycling stability. This study provides a paradigm of solving complex problems via multifunctional molecule engineering and strategic cooperation towards Li&#8208;S batteries and other battery communities.</dc:description>

         <title>Performance and Stability of Corundum&#8208;type In2O3&#160;Catalyst for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol is a key chemical reaction to store energy in chemical bonds, using carbon dioxide as an energy sink. Indium oxide is amongst the most promising candidates for replacing the copper and zinc oxide catalyst, which is industrially applied for syngas mixtures but less idoneous for educts with carbon dioxide due to instability reasons. The polymorph of indium oxide and the operating conditions remain to be optimized for optimal and stable performance. Indium oxide catalysts containing different rhombohedral and cubic phase ratios were synthesized using a solvothermal method and evaluated in an ideally mixed gas phase reactor. The pure rhombohedral catalyst achieved the best performance in terms of yield to methanol, selectivity, and stability. The phase stability was assessed using synchrotron in&#8208;situ XRD and Rietveld refinement, shedding light on the stability of the different phases at extended operating conditions. Depending on the flow rate, temperature, and hydrogen partial pressure, a rhombohedral to cubic transition occurs, ultimately yielding inactive metallic indium. If present, cubic In2O3 serves as nuclei to induce the cubic to rhombohedral transition, hampering performance. These results allow for a more rational catalyst design and fine&#8208;tuning of the operating conditions,&#160;ensuring&#160;optimal and stable performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;entropy engineering on sustainable anionic redox Mn&#8208;based cathode with retardant stress for high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;based) layered oxides have emerged as competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), primarily due to their high energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and potential for mass production. However, these materials often suffer from irreversible oxygen redox reactions, significant phase transitions, and microcrack formation, which lead to considerable internal stress and degradation of electrochemical performance. This study introduces a high&#8208;entropy engineering strategy for P2&#8208;type Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes (HE&#8208;NMCO), wherein a multi&#8208;ingredient cocktail effect strengthens the lattice framework by modulating the local environmental chemistry. This innovative approach fosters sustainable reversible oxygen activity, mitigates stress concentrations at grain boundaries, and accelerates Na&#8314; transport kinetics. The resulting robust lattice framework with optimized elemental interactions significantly improves structural integrity and reduces the formation of intragranular fractures. Consequently, HE&#8208;NMCO demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, retaining 93.5% capacity after 100 deep (de)sodiation cycles, alongside an enhanced rate capability of 134.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5C. Notably, comparative studies through multimodal characterization techniques highlight HE&#8208;NMCO's superior reversibility in oxygen anion redox (OAR) reactions over extensive cycling, contrasting sharply with conventional NMCO cathode. This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn&#8208;based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.</dc:description>

This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn-based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Direct Air Capture in Industrial Cooling Towers Mediated by Electrochemical CO2 Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising technology for mitigating global climate change but suffers from low efficiency, small scale, and high cost due to the dilute atmospheric CO2, limited size of air contactors, and heat&#8208;driven CO2 release. Here, we propose combining DAC with widely used industrial cooling towers to extract CO2 from the air and using electrolysis to release the captured CO2 at room temperature. We first prepare a buffered absorbent solution consisting of sodium glycinate, glycine, and sodium chloride for effective CO2 capture from the air, solving the incompatibility problem of the cooling towers with conventional absorbents. Next, we employ a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer for efficient release (&#8805;95%) of the captured CO2 with high purity (&#8805;98%) by constant current electrolysis at room temperature, bypassing the conventional energy&#8208;intensive heating process. The entire DAC system can operate stably for multiple cycles, and the mechanism for consecutive CO2 capture and release is uncovered. This work reveals the great potential of running DAC in industrial cooling towers coupled with electrochemically&#8208;driven CO2 release, opening up new avenues for curbing the increasingly severe climate change.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Manipulation of Porous Coordination Cages Tunes the Efficiency and Selectivity in Electrochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals has been attracting growing interest owing to its environmentally benign reaction pathways. Among these processes, the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;) to ammonia (NH3), known as NO3RR, and the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) stand out as two cornerstone reactions; yet, their efficiency and selectivity pose ongoing challenges. In this study, we introduce a charge manipulation approach for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts tailored for the simultaneous coupling of NO3RR and HMFOR. We have synthesized a range of porous coordination cages (PCCs) that share the same topology and Co/Ni metal centers but incorporate different charged moeities, imparting them with distinct surface net charges. Electrocatalytic evaluations revealed that PCC&#8208;Co demonstrated a voltage&#8208;dependent activity in NO3RR. Conversely, PCC&#8208;Ni exhibited a precisely adjustable product selectivity in HMFOR, contingent upon the cage's charge state. In&#8208;situ analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations underscored the profound impact of catalyst charge on the differential adsorption of reaction intermediates and the lowest free energy change (&#916;G) during the pivotal reaction step, resulting in alterations to both activity and selectivity. These discoveries provide invaluable insights into the "structure&#8208;performance relationship" of NO3RR/HMFOR catalysts, highlighting PCCs as promising contenders for advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Stapled Helical Peptides for Targeting Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide stapling has emerged as a versatile approach in drug discovery to reinforce secondary structure elements especially &#945;&#8208;helices and improve properties of linear bioactive peptides. Inspired by the prevalence of arginine in protein&#8211;protein and protein&#8211;DNA interfaces, we investigated guanidinium&#8208;stapling as a means to constrain helical peptides. Guanidinium stapling was readily achieved on solid support, utilizing two orthogonally protected lysine or unatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid residues with an amino function. This method allows for easy modulation of the nature and size of the staple as well as helix propensity. Evaluating a set of guanidinium&#8208;stapled peptides for their interaction with different protein targets identified several binders with increased target affinity. X&#8208;ray structure determination of four complexes revealed that all stapled peptides adopt a helical conformation upon protein binding. Notably, the disubstituted guanidinium generally exhibits a distinct cis/trans conformation and, in one instance, retains a conserved hydrogen bond with the protein surface. By identifying, for the first time, the guanidinium moiety as an effective helical peptide stapling group, this research significantly expands the repertoire of &#945;&#8208;helix stapling techniques for the creation of useful protein mimics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Design of Lithium Anode via Dynamic Stability Strategy for Practical All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery (ASSLB) chemistry with thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) membranes features high energy density and intrinsic safety but suffers from severe dendrite formation and poor interface contact during cycling, which hampers the practical application of rechargeable ASSLB. Here, we propose a universal design of thin Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) via a dynamic stability strategy to address these issues. The ultra&#8208;thin LMA (20 &#956;m) is in&#8208;situ constructed with uniform highly Li&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and composite&#8208;polymer interphase (CPI) via electroplating process. As a result, the passivation layer with poor Li&#8208;ion conduction on Li anode can be dissolved and small surface resistance can be achieved due to the good compatibility of CPI to SSEs. The cycling of Li symmetric cell with Li6PS5Cl thin film electrolyte (&lt; 100 &#956;m) shows a high critical current density of &gt; 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2 with excellent cycling stability at 1.0 mA cm&#8208;2. The ASSLBs paring with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode demonstrated the feasibility of engineered LMA design by presenting good rate capability from 0.1C to 1.0 C at room temperature, as well as long&#8208;term cycling stability (81% retention after 100 cycles). This work represents a general pathway to make thin dendrite&#8208;free LMA available for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Topotactic Transformation in Fe3O4 Induces Spontaneous Growth of Compositionally Diverse Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topotactic transformation is an emerging strategy for synthesizing materials with exotic functional properties. In this report, instead of producing new crystals with related structures, we exploited the topotactic transformation phenomenon to spontaneously produce compositionally diverse nanostructures on the&#160;transforming substrate. The surface of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) is topotactically transformed into maghemite (&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3). Benefiting from such oxidation susceptibility of ultrasmall Fe3O4 NPs, we achieved spontaneous growth of metals (Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd), a non&#8208;metal (Se), and a metal oxide (MnO2) based nanostructures onto the surface of Fe3O4. No spontaneous growth of nanostructures was observed when the oxidized Fe3O4 NPs were tested, likely due to the loss of the Fe2+&#8208;associated mobile electrons. The obtained nanostructures displayed appreciable antioxidant activities, which we utilized to effectively treat inflammation in the intestines. It is anticipated that this synthetic route, based on topotactic transformation, represents a significant advancement in synthesizing various chemically diverse hetero&#8208;nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Polyhydroxyalkanoates with Diverse Syndiotacticity via Polymerization by Spiro&#8208;Salen Complexes and Insights into the Stereocontrol Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted broad interest as promising sustainable materials to address plastic pollution and resource scarcity. However, the chemical synthesis of stereoregular PHAs via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) has long been an elusive endeavor. In this contribution, we exploited a robust spiro&#8208;salen yttrium complex (Y3) as the catalyst to successfully prepare syndiotactic PHAs with diverse pendent groups. Simply altering the ratio of enantiomeric catalysts allowed to access of PHAs with diverse syndiotacticity (Pr = 0.5&#8722;0.99, from sticky oil to tough materials), delivering tunable thermal properties (glass transition temperature, Tg from &#8211;52 to 70 &#176;C and melting transition temperature, Tm from 38 to 223 &#176;C). A combined experimental and computational study suggested a polymeric exchange mechanism could boost the polymerization activity and control the syndioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lithiophilic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymer Modified Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are approaching their theoretical limits. To achieve higher energy density, the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is essential. However, uncontrolled ion transport and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer are key factors inducing lithium dendrite growth, hindering the development of LMBs. Separator modification is an effective strategy to address the challenges of LMBs. To tackle the issues, a donor&#8208;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was successfully synthesized and modified onto commercial polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for LMBs. Benefitting from the highly lithiophilic triazine organic units, this ArMT exhibits affinity towards Li+ and simplifies the solvation structure of Li+ during the diffusion process, thus decreasing the ion diffusion activation energy, thereby accelerating the migration of Li+. Furthermore, triazine organic units with appropriate pore size regulate the plating/stripping behavior of lithium metal anodes, thereby facilitating the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. As a result, the assembled Li|ArMT@PP|Li symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping over 800 h. Moreover, the LiFePO4|ArMT@PP|Li cells achieved excellent cycling stability with 127.3 mAh g&#8208;1 after 1200 cycles at 1C and a high capacity retention of 90.58%. This design strategy pave the way for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation via an Enzymatic Pathway on a Distorted CoP4 Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic nitrogen (N2) fixation over semiconductors has always suffered from poor conversion efficiency owing to weak N2 adsorption and the difficulty of N&#8801;N triple bond dissociation. Herein, a Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) model with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated using a selective phosphidation strategy, wherein P&#8208;doping and C defects co&#8208;regulate the local electronic structure of Co sites. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the distorted CoP4 configuration caused a strong charge redistribution between the Co atoms and adjacent C atoms, minimizing their electronegativity difference. Consequently, the N2 adsorption pattern switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode with a high N2 adsorption energy of &#8211;1.40 eV and an elongated N&#8208;N bond length of 1.20 &#197;, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway. The NH3 yielding rate peaked at 1249.5 &#956;mol h&#8722;1g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.51% at 365 nm. Moreover, the selective phosphidation strategy has universality for synthesizing other SACs, such as those containing Ni and Fe. This study offers new insight into co&#8208;regulating the electronic structure of SACs for efficient photocatalytic overall N2 fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactam (PoTeM) Core Structure Diversity by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis and Bioengineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) represent a growing class of bioactive natural products that are derived from a common tetramate polyene precursor, lysobacterene A, produced by an unusual bacterial iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) / non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The structural and functional diversity of PoTeMs is biosynthetically elaborated from lysobacterene A by pathway&#8208;specific cyclizing and modifying enzymes. This results in diverse core structure decoration and cyclization patterns. However, approaches to directly edit the PoTeM carbon skeleton are currently not existing. We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural L&#8208;ornithine&#8208;derived building block by L&#8208;lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH2 group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach corroborated the catalytic competence of IkaBC to produce a larger macrolactam yielding homo&#8208;ikarugamycin. We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept L&#8208;lysine, which upon co&#8208;expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo&#8208;ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds&#8208;Mediated Color&#8208;Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Helical Assemblies of Achiral Liquid Crystal Block Copolymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film attracted considerable attention in information storage and encryption, three&#8208;dimensional display, and chiral recognition. However, due to the limited molecular mobility within thin film, achieving a high asymmetry factor and non&#8208;contact modulation of CPL remain challenging. In this work, color&#8208;switchable homochiral CPL films with high luminescence asymmetry factor (glum~0.11) were constructed based on the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (poly (ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly (methyl methacrylate) bearing cyanostilbene group) with axial chiral dinaphthalene diamine derivatives (R/S&#8208;DINBPA). Mechanistic investigation revealed that the efficient stacking of R/S&#8208;DINBPA with cyanostilbene groups and the liquid crystal field provide the driving force for chiral transfer and amplification. The dynamic covalent bonds of the cyanostilbene groups endow the film with chiral fixation ability and enable precise modulation of CPL luminescence bands under UV light irradiation, making it suitable for chiral patterned anti&#8208;counterfeit encryption. This facile strategy provides a general platform for designing intelligent chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been regarded as the promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical applications of NFPP are hindered by its high&#8208;volume changes, poor intrinsic electron conductivity and sluggish Na+ ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, a spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method have been utilized to fabricate the spherical trace amount Mg/Cu co&#8208;doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP). The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP by reducing band gap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the unique spherical structured NFMCPP with a carbon film even coated on its surface ensures rapid electron transport. Moreover, small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry demonstrate an alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress and enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables fluent Na+ extraction/insertion, leads to a low high&#8208;stress concentration and uniform stress/strain distribution during extensive (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the optimized spherical NFMCPP cathode materials exhibit an excellent rate capability and cyclic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating p&#8208;&#960; Resonance through Methoxy Group Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for an Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic factors frequently emerge as the primary constraints in photocatalysis, exerting a critical influence on the efficacy of polymeric photocatalysts. The diverse conjugation systems within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can significantly impact photon absorption, energy level structures, charge separation and migration kinetics. Consequently, these limitations often manifest as unsatisfactory kinetic behavior, which adversely affects the photocatalytic activity of COFs. To address these challenges, we propose a methoxy (&#8208;OMe) molecular engineering strategy designed to enhance charge carrier kinetics and mitigate mass transfer resistance. Through strategic modulation of the position and quantity of &#8208;OMe units, we can effectively manipulate the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, thereby enhancing charge separation and migration. Moreover, COFs enriched with &#8208;OMe moieties exhibit enhanced mass transfer dynamics due to the hydrophilic nature of methoxy groups, which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products within the porous structure. This approach is hypothesized to drive an efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Birefringence in Fluorides Constructed from Linear &#960;&#8208;Group Anisotropic Structure Building Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing laser technologies requires maximizing the anisotropy of crystalline media and overcoming current birefringence limitations. We introduce the strategy of linear &#960; group anisotropic structure building units (ABUCB), leading to an unprecedented large birefringence (&#916;n), a record&#8208;high &#916;nobv. of 0.152 in sodium bis(dicyanoborato)fluoride (Na[BF2(CN)2]), the highest reported among deep ultraviolet (DUV) materials. This value is 35 % greater than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;BBO and 1167 % greater than MgF2. Density functional theory analyses suggest that the linear &#960; group enhances bulk optical anisotropy and ensures a shorter DUV absorption edge. These results establish Na[BF2(CN)2] as a groundbreaking DUV birefringent material and open new avenues for research into extending &#960; groups and exploring additional possibilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Hydrogen Transfer in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction via a Hydrogen on Demand Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn&#8211;N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of &#8722;539.7 mA cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiencies of CO &gt; 90% over a broad window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6 &#215; 104 h&#8722;1 in flow cell. In&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2&#8722; with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized Adsorption of Had and OHad over Amorphous SrRuPtOxHy Nanobelts towards Efficient Alkaline Fuel Cell Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PtRu&#8208;based catalysts toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffer from low efficiency, CO poisoning and over&#8208;oxidation at high potentials. In this work, an amorphization strategy is adopted for preparation of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs). The a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs have optimized adsorption of intermediates (H and OH), increased number of active sites, highly weakened CO poisoning and enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation ability owing to the special amorphous structure. Consequently, a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs displays superior HOR performance with a mass activity of 7.3 A/mgPt+Ru, 23 and 5 times of that of SrRuPt(OH)x NBs and commercial PtRu/C, respectively, and long&#8208;lasting stability. Besides, a peak power density of 750 mW/cm2 and a specific power of 14.8 W/mgPt+Ru have been achieved for a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs at a low loading of 0.05 mgPt+Ru/cm2, surpassing many reported HOR catalysts. Mechanism investigation indicates that Pt and Ru are present in oxide/hydroxide forms and H in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs participates in HOR. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that there are three catalytic mechanisms participating in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs, which all exhibit low catalytic barrier and highly improved HOR efficiency. This work provids a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts towards fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Process for the Regiodivergent Double Hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In industry, the two important nitrile starting materials, adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile, are primarily manufactured through the well&#8208;known DuPont process, which consists of a tandem sequence including first hydrocyanation, isomerization and second hydrocyanation. However, this mature process has the intrinsic defects of step efficiency and regioselectivity. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to produce either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile in high regioselectivity. The key to this success lies in the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which creates a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center. The first hydrocyanation that produces either the linear or branched alkenyl nitrile was identified as the selectivity&#8208;determining step. Organometallic studies confirm the formation of well&#8208;defined diphosphite nickel diene complexes in solution, and the role of ligands in dictating regioselectivity was further rationalized by DFT computations. This result provides the first example of a highly selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile from butadiene, and it also represents a high&#8208;level of catalyst&#8208;controlled regioselectivity via the fine&#8208;tuning of ligand pocket geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Hydration Enables Generality in Asymmetric Catalysis: Desymmetrization to P&#8208;Stereogenic Triarylphosphine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric synthesis relies on seamless transmission of stereochemical information from a chiral reagent/catalyst to a prochiral substrate. The disruption by substrates&#8217; structural changes presents a hurdle in innovating generality&#8208;oriented asymmetric catalysis. Here, we report a strategy for substrate adaptability by exploiting a fundamental physicochemical phenomenon&#8212;ion hydration, in developing remote desymmetrization to access P&#8208;stereogenic triarylphosphine oxides and sulfides. Compared to existing methods, this approach does not require pre&#8208;installed ortho substituents and avoids the use of Grignard/organolithium reagents. Simply tuning the water/ion ratio in the reaction media tailors the water&#8208;mediated ionic substrate&#8211;catalyst preorganization to counterbalance the structural changes in the substrates, thus further increasing the diversity of enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic compounds. This study shows that it is viable and practical to precisely manipulate ionic interactions through tuning the dynamic ion hydration in&#8208;situ, thereby adding a distinctive dimension to catalyst engineering in the pursuit of substrate generality in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyzed Skeletal Rearrangement Enables the Synthesis of Highly Functionalized Xanthenes&#160;with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly functionalized xanthenes&#160;possess an impressive range of bioactivities and daunting synthetic challenge due to their unique ring systems and stereocenters. Here, we report an unprecedented ketyl radicals&#8208;induced skeletal rearrangement reaction of spirodihydrobenzofurans, enabled by zero&#8208;valent iron as reducing agents via photoredox catalysis, facilitating the facile preparation of various highly functionalized xanthenes. The features of this protocol include high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, exceptionally mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, scalability to gram&#8208;scale quantities, and consistent delivery of good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies rationalize the function of this zero&#8208;valent iron&#8208;based reactivity in radical generation. Notably, this reaction was applied to the first asymmetric total synthesis of the complex polycyclic xanthene ent&#8208;myrtucomvalones&#160;E&#8208;F. Moreover, this work led to the discovery of an agent with highly effective antiosteosarcoma&#160;activity in vitro&#160;and in vivo,&#160;potentially paving the way for the development of new&#160;xanthene&#8208;based candidates&#160;for osteosarcoma treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing 2D Anion&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Temperature Water Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular frameworks have recently shown a great potential in atmospheric water harvesting, in which the water release at low temperatures is challenging. Anion&#8208;organic frameworks based on anion&#8208;coordination chemistry are presented herein to meet this challenge. These frameworks are prepared as tubular single crystals in pure water from the in&#8208;situ protonation and crystallization of pyridine&#8208;terminated triphenylamine derivatives with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. They possess a 2D honeycombed porous structure and carry halogen anions confined within 1D hexagonal nanochannels with a modular size of 1.7~2.3 nm. They exhibit a high water uptake of up to 0.87 g g&#8722;1 and a water release onset temperature as low as &#8722;90 oC. The water uptake and release induce significant changes in the crystal morphology and absorption and emission properties of these framework crystals, providing a visual indication of their hydration states over a wide temperature range. The kinetics of dehydration at subglacial temperatures is successfully determined by emission spectral shifts. These framework crystals show a high water&#8208;stability and can be used for repeated water capture and release thanks to a rapid and robust self&#8208;healing capability. This discovery opens opportunities for the design and synthesis of flexible and self&#8208;healing frameworks for porosity&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Supramolecular Nanoarchitectonics for Simultaneous Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis in a Co&#8208;assembly by a Biomimetic Isolation&#8208;Conduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited by the two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers, achieving photoluminescence and photocatalysis&#160;simultaneously is extremely challenging but essential for ever&#8208;growing complex issues and specialized scenarios. Here we proposed a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy induced by an arene&#8211;perfluoroarene (A&#8211;P) interaction for enabling photoluminescence and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in the co&#8208;assembly of aromatic monomers and octafluoronapthalene (OFN). Inspired by the isolation&#8208;conduction effect of periodic isolation of myelin sheaths on the axons of vertebrate nerve fibers by node of Ranvier, we use OFN as a molecular isolator embedded in the aromatic monomers array to block the singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet pathway, while the enlarged intermolecular dipoles resulting from the A&#8211;P interactions facilitate the conduction of photogenerated carriers in the isolated regions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly exhibits an enhanced monomeric green emission compared to the corresponding monocomponent self&#8208;assembly with weak red emission. Meanwhile, it also has an enhanced photocatalytic HER performance with a rate of 2.45 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, which is 15.2 times more than the self&#8208;assembled one. On this basis, a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system that includes real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids and photocatalytic HER device is constructed.</dc:description>

         <title>Current&#8208;Regulated Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Carbonylation to &#946;/&#947;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nickel catalyzed multi&#8208;component cross&#8208;electrophile carbonylation which emerges as a powerful and efficient method for constructing diverse ketones has attracted increasing attention of organic chemists. However, the selectivity of this reaction poses a significant challenge. In this work, we have developed a current&#8208;regulated selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile carbonylation, which offers a direct convergent synthesis of &#946;/&#947;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, which represent pivotal structural motifs found in numerous natural products, bioactive molecules, pharmaceutical compounds, and essential building blocks. A diverse range of multi&#8208;substituted or stereospecific &#946;/&#947;&#8208;hydroxyketones can be accessed with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity from epoxides, aryl iodides, and a simple CO source (ClCO2Pr). This electroreductive carbonylation strategy exhibits high functional group tolerance and can be applied in late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs and natural products. Notably, chiral epoxides can be employed as reactants with chirality retention, enabling the synthesis of asymmetric &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. Our approach demonstrates a novel electrochemical selectivity&#8208;controlled strategy in multi&#8208;component cross&#8208;electrophile coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>The Interplay Between Component Denticity and Flexibility Promotes the Formation of [AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI]&#8722;stabilised Links and Knots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A subtle interplay between the flexibility of the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;based diamine and the denticity of the coordination domain formed upon self&#8208;assembly enabled the formation of four distinct topologies stabilised by [Ag&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag]2+ pairs. The reactions utilising 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine resulted in the formation of silver(I)&#8208;stabilised molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link. The 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot, demonstrating very close AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI distances. Two of the studied assemblies demonstrated interesting luminescent properties in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolite Encapsulation to Enhance Interfacial Gas Availability for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic oxidation of water with gaseous oxygen is environmentally benign for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but it is currently constrained by the inadequate supply of gaseous oxygen at the catalyst surface in a solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas triple&#8208;phase reaction system. Herein, we address this challenge by employing the zeolite encapsulated catalysts that efficiently enrich gaseous oxygen and accelerate the H2O2 synthesis in in aqueous conditions. We focus on the classical titania photocatalyst, encapsulating it within siliceous MFI zeolite crystals. This encapsulation results in a significant enhancement in H2O2 synthesis efficiency, achieving a yield that is ten times greater than that with unencapsulated TiO2. Mechanism study reveals that gaseous oxygen is notably concentrated within the microporous structure of the zeolite under aqueous conditions, thereby facilitating its interaction with the titania surface at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. In addition, the H2O2 product could swiftly transfer through the micropores, thereby reducing the side reaction of decomposition. This design provides an alternative pathway to address the poor gas solubility of gaseous reactants in water, and paves the way for advancements in various other photocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyurethane Elastomers Strengthened by Pseudo[1]rotaxanes Based on Pillararenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a unique property of the interlocked structures, rotaxane allows for intramolecular motions between its wheel and axle components. Introduction of rotaxanes into polymers can endow them with distinctive macroscopic features and outstanding mechanical properties. Here, we prepare a copillar[5]arene with a hydroxyl and an amino&#8208;group on each end, which can spontaneously form a pseudo[1]rotaxane through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This pseudo[1]rotaxane possesses a releasable extra alkyl chain, which is then incorporated into a linear polyurethane by reacting with a diisocyanate to prepare polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. The results of stress&#8208;strain test and dynamic mechanical analysis all indicate that sliding motions of the axle part on the pseudo[1]rotaxane in the polymer skeleton can greatly dissipate energy, which endows the elastomers with higher toughness and better fatigue resistance. Moreover, the addition of moderate amount of cuprous bromide to form cuprous&#8208;thioether coordination in the polymers can further improve the mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reinforced &#8220;Microglia Energy Modulator&#8221; for Synergistic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Clearance in Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microglial phagocytosis is a highly energy&#8208;consuming process that plays critical roles in clearing neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). However, microglial metabolism is defective overall in AD, thereby undermining microglial phagocytic functions. Herein, we repurpose the existing antineoplastic drug lonidamine (LND) conjugated with hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) as a &#8220;microglial energy modulator&#8221; (termed LND@HMPB&#8208;T7) for safe and synergistic A&#946; clearance. The modified blood&#8208;brain barrier penetrating heptapeptide (T7) enables efficient transport of LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 to the AD brain. LND in LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could fuel A&#946; phagocytosis by stimulating microglial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, whereas HMPB with catalase and superoxide dismutase&#8208;mimicking activities substantially alleviates the mitochondrial side effects commonly associated with LND and thus further enhances ATP production. The synergism of LND and nanozyme affords a high microglial A&#946; clearance efficacy without triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. In vivo experiments ascertain that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could synergistically promote phagocytic clearance of A&#946;, relieve neuroinflammation and ameliorate cognitive function in AD mice. These findings indicate that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 holds tremendous clinical potential as a repurposed drug for AD treatment.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglial phagocytosis is a highly energy-consuming process that plays critical roles in clearing neurotoxic amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). However, microglial metabolism is defective overall in AD, thereby undermining microglial phagocytic functions.

         <dc:description>A new series of metal&#8208;organic nanotubes was constructed through one&#8208;dimensional assembly using molecular triangles or molecular squares composed of paddlewheel dirhodium complexes and bidentate axial ligands. The metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were significantly different from conventional solid metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) motifs. They exhibit good solubility owing to the branched side chains at their periphery and demonstrate high orientation capabilities in thin films owing to their anisotropic structure. Furthermore, the nanotubes can accommodate guest molecules in nanochannels and orient them on a large scale on a glass substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Lipid Domain Positioning and Polarization in Confined Minimal Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are widely used minimal cell models where essential biological features can be reproduced, isolated and studied. Although precise spatio&#8208;temporal distribution of membrane domains is a process of crucial importance in living cells, it is still highly challenging to generate anisotropic GUVs with domains at user&#8208;defined positions. Here we describe a novel and robust method to control the spatial position of lipid domains of liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo) / liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phase in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Our strategy consists in confining Lo/Ld phase&#8208;separated GUVs in microfluidic channels to define free curved regions where the minority&#8208;phase domains localize and coalesce by decreasing the line energy through domain fusion. We show that this process is governed by the respective fraction of the two phases, and not by the chemical nature of the lipids involved. The spatial position and number of domains are controlled by the design of the confining microchannel and could result in polarized GUVs with a controllable number of poles. The developed method is versatile and user&#8208;friendly, while allowing to perform multiple single&#8208;vesicle experiments in parallel.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanorods by Synchronized Polymerization, Self&#8208;Assembly and Oriented Attachment for Utilization in Magnetically Responsive Displays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of anisotropic nanoparticles (NPs) by polymerization and/or self&#8208;assembly (SA) has significantly promoted the applications of polymer nanomaterials in many fields. However, polymer nanorods are not easily accessible via conventional polymerization or SA. Here we report a one&#8208;step route to synthesize single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) nanorods utilizing oriented attachment (OA) that was usually found in the synthesis of inorganic NPs, synchronized with polymerization and SA. The synchronization was achieved by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. Mechanistic studies reveal that controlling the thermo&#8208;responsive behavior and the distribution of stabilizers on NPs enabled OA. The LC nanorods can further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this LC system can be manipulated by an external magnetic field, thus providing a candidate material for magnetic&#8208;responsive display.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;Mediated Biomimetic Synthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoate with C4 Diol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(4&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P4HB) is a high&#8208;performance, well&#8208;recyclable, and biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). However, conventional bioproduction of homopolymeric P4HB involves complex and costly processes with C4 feedstocks, particularly 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO), and enzyme&#8208;coenzyme systems in genetically engineered bacteria. An alternative extracellular chemical route utilizing aerial oxidation of BDO offers cost and energy benefits but struggle with conversion efficiency. Inspired by efficient intracellular oxidation of primary alcohols, we propose a ruthenium&#8208;phosphine synergistic catalytic system that mimics enzyme&#8208;coenzyme functionality. This system effectively catalyzed the air&#8208;mediated, solvent&#8208;free oxidation of BDO to produce &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#947;&#8208;BL) and oligomeric P4HB, with a space&#8208;time yield (10.37 g [&#947;&#8208;BL unit] g&#8208;1 catalyst h&#8208;1) surpassing the values (&lt;5.5) of previous approaches. The oligomer&#8208;containing products were reversibly converted to &#947;&#8208;BL and then to P4HB (28.9 kDa) via ring&#8208;opening polymerization, exceeding reported values (&lt;16 kDa). This study provides the potential for large&#8208;scale synthesis of high&#8208;value PHAs from diverse non&#8208;grain&#8208;based diols, offering economic and environmental advantages.</dc:description>

         <title>Through Space &#960;&#8208;Electrons Communication in [2,2]&#8208;Paracyclophanes: Unprecendented Stabilization of Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efforts to understand radical stability have led to considerable progress in radical chemistry. In this article, we investigated a novel approach to enhancing the radical stability of carbon&#8208;centered radicals through space electron delocalization within [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes. Alkoxyamines possessing a paracyclophane scaffold exploit face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interactions between the aromatic rings to effectively lower bond dissociation energy (BDE) for NO&#8208;C bond homolysis. Electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments and computational modeling have confirmed a better stability compared to the analogues without the paracyclophane core. Theoretical analyses further elucidate the role of through&#8208;space electron communication in enhancing radical stability.
This study highlights promising applications in fields such as organic synthesis, material science, and drug design. By achieving a low BDE for homolysis, the alkoxyamines efficiently release radicals, enabling successful application in nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP) of styrene, which provides high control over polymer architecture. Additionally, preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative assays reveal that the alkoxyamines exhibit promising anti&#8208;cancer activities against lung, breast, and prostate cells, which is correlated to their ability to release radicals upon homolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Mediated Helical Chirality in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral hybrid perovskites A2PbI4 (A: chiral organic ion) enable chirality controlled optoelectronic and spin&#8208;based properties. A+ organic sublattice induces chirality into the semiconducting [PbI4]2&#8208; inorganic sublattice through non&#8208;covalent interactions at organic&#8208;inorganic interface. Often, the A+ cations in the lattice have different orientations, leading to asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions. In a novel approach, we use different conformers of A+ cations to create asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions, thereby, achieving chiral perovskites with rare helical enantiomorphic structures. We prepared (R&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 and (S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 (IdPA: 1&#8208;iodopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ammonium) which crystallize in the helical enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of IdPA+ are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, the anti&#8208;conformer of IdPA+ ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding, and I&#183;&#183;&#183;I halogen bonding interactions with the [PbI4]2&#8208; sublattice, compared to the gauche&#8208;conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions caused by the alternative arrangement of gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers induces chirality in the inorganic sublattice with four&#8208;fold screw axes (4&#8323; and 4&#8321;). The enantiomers (R&#8208;/S&#8208;IAP)2PbI4 show mirror&#8208;image like circular dichroism from excitonic absorption of the inorganic sublattice. This conformer&#8208;based design of chiral hybrid perovskites in helical space groups broadens material choices for advanced optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

Often, the A+ cations in the lattice have different orientations, leading to asymmetry in the non-covalent interactions. In a novel approach, we use different conformers of A+ cations to create asymmetry in the non-covalent interactions, thereby, achieving chiral perovskites with rare helical enantiomorphic structures. We prepared (R-IdPA)2PbI4 and (S-IdPA)2PbI4 (IdPA: 1-iodopropan-2-ammonium) which crystallize in the helical enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The gauche- and anti-conformers of IdPA+ are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, the anti-conformer of IdPA+ ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, N-H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding, and I&#183;&#183;&#183;I halogen bonding interactions with the [PbI4]2- sublattice, compared to the gauche-conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non-covalent interactions caused by the alternative arrangement of gauche- and anti-conformers induces chirality in the inorganic sublattice with four-fold screw axes (4&#8323; and 4&#8321;). The enantiomers (R-/S-IAP)2PbI4 show mirror-image like circular dichroism from excitonic absorption of the inorganic sublattice. This conformer-based design of chiral hybrid perovskites in helical space groups broadens material choices for advanced optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Enhanced Linear and Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties of Chiral Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) hold great&#160;promise in broad applications ranging from ferroelectrics, spintronics to nonlinear optics, owing to their broken inversion symmetry and tunable chiroptoelectronic properties. Typically, chiral HOMHs are constructed by chiral organic cations and metal anion polyhedra, with the latter regarded as optoelectronic active units. However, the primary design approaches are largely constrained to regulation of general components within structural formula. Herein, supramolecular approaches have been taken for the functionalization of chiral enantiomers by anchoring chiral cations with crown ether hosting molecules. Chiral HOMHs of R&#8208;/S&#8208;(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6@ClMBA)2MnBr4 have been thus obtained with boosted linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. The self&#8208;assembled cations lead to enhanced structural rigidity, which promote near&#8208;unity green light emission and strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high asymmetry factor, along with high efficiency second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses. In particular, these chiral HOMH single crystals demonstrate a sensitive discrimination for circularly polarized laser in the near&#8208;infrared region with the nonlinear optical&#160;asymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) as high as 1.8. This work highlights the contribution of supramolecular assembly in improving chiroptical performances, offering valuable insights for the design of new chiral HOMH materials with promising application potentials as linear and nonlinear CPL emitters and detectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal&#8208;oxygen (MO6) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8208;liquid ratio (1:10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals&#8208;oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing&#8208;ligand (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36% to 17.76% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC2O4&#183;2H2O product (~ 95.7% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Tiered Golf Anode towards Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Mn Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs) are widely recognized as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of ZMABs is hindered by inherent electrical contact loss, hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth on traditional anodes. Here, a three&#8208;tiered golf anode with high conductivity is developed to simultaneously enhance the reversibility of Zn and Mn metals. The three&#8208;tiered golf anode is achieved by inner zinc powder, intermediate carbon and outer bismuth layer, which can effectively enhance the Gibbs free energy and mitigate the volume change of the anode, thus enabling stable Zn&#8208;Mn cycling. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8208;Mn full cells (coupled to CNT@MnO2) achieve an ultralong cycle life with 94.6% capacity retention at 2 A g&#8722;1 after 16,000 cycles. This study presents valuable insights into the structural design of anodes aimed at enhancing the stability and durability of ZMABs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes depends on the precise electronic interactions between active centers and cofactors within a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) attempt to mimic this structure by modifying metal active sites with molecular ligands. However, SAzymes struggle to match the catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes due to constraints in active site proximity, quantity, and the inability to simulate electron transfer processes driven by internal electronic structures of natural enzymes. This study introduces a universal spatial engineering strategy in which molecular ligands are replaced with graphdiyne (GDY) to induce d&#8208;&#960; orbital hybridization with copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs), leading to an asymmetric electron&#8208;rich distribution along the longitudinal axis that mimics the local electric field of natural laccase. Moreover, multiple sp bonds within GDY scaffold effectively anchor Cu NPs, facilitating the construction of 3D geometric structure similar to that of natural laccase. An enzymatic activity of 82.53 U mg&#8315;1 is achieved, 4.72 times higher than that of natural laccase. By reconstructing both 3D structures and local electric fields of natural enzymes through d&#8208;&#960; orbital hybridization, this approach enhances electron interactions between cofactors, active centers, and substrates, and offers a versatile framework for biomimetic design of nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors display application potential in green power and high&#8208;end equipment owing to their high security, large power and sustainability. The water&#8208;rich zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface (AEI) and disordered zinc&#8208;ion diffusion are the culprits triggering corrosion reactions and dendrite growth, threatening the sustainability of aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors. Herein, a polyfunctional biomolecular, vitamin B6, is introduced into the traditional aqueous electrolyte for customizing the functional AEI and fine&#8208;regulating the interfacial coordination environment of zinc ions. Specifically, the preferential anchoring of pyridine nitrogen enables trace vitamin (2.0 g L&#8208;1) to construct a robust AEI and suppress corrosion reactions. The hydroxyl function zone provides high&#8208;octane guidance for zinc&#8208;ion diffusion at the AEI, resulting in flat zinc (002) oriented growth. Consequently, the Zn//Zn symmetrical cell features an ultrahigh cumulative capacity of 4.0 Ah cm&#8208;2 under 34% depth of discharge. The vitamin&#8208;optimized zinc&#8208;carbon capacitor features extended operational lifetimes exceeding 8 months (200 thousand cycles at 5.0 A g&#8208;1), and demonstrates a high areal capacity of averaging 0.68 mAh cm&#8208;2 and exceptional durability over 2000 hours at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 under a high discharge depth of zinc anode (averaging 11.6%). This work offers valuable insights into sustainable and cost&#8208;effective zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors.</dc:description>

Herein a collective, selective, and diversity&#8208;oriented approach for up to 6 types of 2D/3D polycyclic scaffolds featuring bicyclo[n.1.1] substructure is reported. A boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed [2s+2p] cycloaddition between bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and ortho&#8208;quinone methides afforded spirocyclic compounds containing a bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane unit, which were used as intermediates for synthesis of three types of 2D/3D scaffolds via judiciously controlled Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements. The reaction and rearrangement of para&#8208;quinone methides worked analogously and provided another two polycyclic scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>A 17.73% Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen Efficiency with Durably Active Catalyst in Stable Photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis Seawater System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing durably active catalysts to tackle harsh voltage polarization and seawater corrosion is pivotal for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion, yet remains a challenge. We report a durably active catalyst of NiCr&#8208;layered double hydroxide (RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH) with highly exposed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ru units, in which low&#8208;loading Ru (0.32 wt%) is locked precisely at defect lattice site (Rulds) by Ni and Cr. The Cr site electron equilibrium reservoir and Cl&#8208; repulsion by intercalated CO32&#8208; ensure the highly durable activity of Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ru units. The RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH&#8214;RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH electrolyzer based on anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) shows ultrastable seawater electrolysis at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. Employing RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH both as anode and cathode, a photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis seawater system achieves a 17.73% STH efficiency, corresponding photoelectricity&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (PVTH) efficiency is 72.37%. Further, we elucidate the dynamic evolutionary mechanism involving the interfacial water dissociation&#8208;oxidation, establishing the correlation between the dynamic behavior of interfacial water with the kinetics, activity of RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalytic water electrolysis. Our work is a breakthrough step for achieving economically scalable production of green hydrogen.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to CO over Ultrawide Potential Window via Implanting Active Site with Long&#8208;Range P Regulation on Periodic Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 to CO represents a highly promising way for artificial carbon cycling, but obtaining high selectivity over a wide potential window remains a challenge due to the sluggish CO generation and diffusion kinetics. Here we report an integration of long&#8208;range P modified asymmetrical bismuth atomic site on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous &#8220;wall&#8221; (MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC) for efficient electroreduction of CO2. In&#8208;depth in&#8208;situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the incorporation of long&#8208;range P atom is able to strengthen the orbital interaction between the C 2p of CO2 and Bi 6p, thereby establishing an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 molecule. Additionally, the ordered macropore with mesoporous wall effectively facilitates the diffusion of CO. As a result, MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC exhibits an ultrawide potential window of 1000 mV for high CO selectivity (&gt;90%) and a maximal CO partial current density of 414&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8208;2. Moreover, MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC can also be employed as the cathode to integrate the solar&#8208;driven electrolytic cell (anode of Co3O4&#8208;OMC) toward CO2 reduction coupled with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation to simultaneously yield CO and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Unconventional Interconnected High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanodendrites for Remarkably Efficient C&#8208;C Bond Cleavage toward Complete Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing ethanol oxidation electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, durability, and resistance to CO poisoning remains a major challenge. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique physical and chemical properties have garnered substantial attention. Herein, a class of HEA nanodendrites are designed by a simple wet&#8208;chemical method. The mass activity and specific activity of the septenary PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst are 2.13 A mgPt&#8208;1/1.05 A mgPt+Ir+Rh&#8208;1 and 2.95 mA cm&#8208;2, which reach 5.76&#8208;/2.84&#8208;fold and 5.57&#8208;fold improvements relative to commercial Pt/C (0.37 A mgPt&#8208;1 and 0.53 mA cm&#8208;2), respectively. Remarkably, after the i&#8208;t test of up to 100,000s and the accelerated durability test of 1500 cycles, 81.22% and 68.54% of the initial mass activity are well retained, respectively. The lattice distortion&#8208;associated local tensile strain as demonstrated by increased Pt&#8208;Pt bond length enhances ethanol adsorption and reduces reaction barriers. The upshift d&#8208;band center promotes ethanol oxidation and anti&#8208;CO capability of the catalysts. Moreover, hysteresis diffusion effect induced by lattice distortion in the HEA nanodendrites contributes to their superb ethanol oxidation stability. In&#8208;situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the three HEA nanodendrites mainly follow C1 pathway with C&#8208;C bond breaking to form CO followed by CO oxidation especially at a wide range of high potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis Enables Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclopropene and Ring Expansion of Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic transformation of carbene species constitutes a fundamental part in organic synthesis, and the research in this direction has been dominated by transition metals while organic catalysts are difficult to mimic such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity. It would significantly advance carbene chemistry if organic catalysts enable achieving classical metal&#8208;carbene approaches otherwise unrealizable reactions. Herein, we report that chalcogen bonding catalysis can solve reactivity problem to achieve an elusive Buchner ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In this work, the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and the ring&#8208;expansion of aryl systems were added in the field of noncovalent catalysis. This work demonstrates that chalcogen bonding can mediate carbene transformations beyond the known ionic approach. In contrast, transition metals such as rhodium, palladium, and copper complexes, could not solve the reactivity problem to achieve ring expansion of aryl ketones but instead these metal&#8208;carbene approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. In addition, a thermal approach even being conducted at 200 oC could not achieve this ring expansion reaction. Mechanistic investigation suggests Se&#8231;&#8231;&#8231;&#960; interaction with cyclopropene facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and chalcogen bonding with carbene intermediate changes the reaction pathway, thus overriding the furan reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly of PROTACs by Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Precision Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold immense promise for targeted protein degradation; however, challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, poor drug&#8208;likeness properties, and the "hook effect" remain. This study introduces Nano&#8208;Click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) for precise tumor protein degradation in vivo. Traditional PROTACs with high molecular weight were first divided into two smaller druglike precursors capable of self&#8208;assembling to form functional PROTACs through a bioorthogonal reaction. Then, optimal CLIPTACs precursors (W4 and Z2) were encapsulated individually into cyclic RGDfC&#8208;peptide&#8208;modified liposomes to prepare Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs, enabling tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and subsequent in situ self&#8208;assembly to form PROTACs WZ42 within tumor cells. The degradation abilities of Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs in vitro and in vivo were further verified using a key oncology target, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), validating the safety, efficacy and &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; of this strategy. Overall, Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs represent a critical step towards the clinical translation of PROTACs technology for precise targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Radical Emission System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new organic radical emission systems and regulating their luminescence properties presents a significant challenge. Herein, we build dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. After the assembling, dual&#8208;band, and excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission was observed upon light irradiation, one emission band originates from carbonyl radical after light irradiation, the other band from the ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which benefits from the charge transfer from the radicals to the metal salts. The dual emission centers also introduce excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties for the molecules. In addition, three&#8208;band emission covering the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions can be shown when two or three kinds of metal ions are simultaneously doped into the radical system driven by the ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT). Interestingly, visible light can quickly quench the radical emission of systems, thus realizing a&#160;dynamic luminescence.&#160;The LMMCT effect and strong supramolecular interactions significantly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by up to 67.2%. Moreover, such materials can be successfully used for detecting radioactive metal ions and&#160;information encryption. This study develops a platform for manufacturing various metal&#8208;organic radical emission systems with diverse properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Stabilization of Excited Triplet States and Enhancement of Internal Electric Field at Dye/PCN Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterojunction photocatalysts composed of organic dyes and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) have great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE). However, serious charge recombination exists at the dye/PCN interface for the large gaps in time scales and the poor driving force of charge transfer process. Herein, both the excited triplet states of organic dyes with long lifetimes and strong internal electric fields (IEF) as charge transfer driving forces are achieved by the construction of high dipole moments with aromatic&#8208;core engineering, and modulation of dye aggregates by alkyl modification. Accordingly, PHE efficiency can achieve up to 833.49 &#956;mol/h, over 36&#8208;fold that of PCN/Pt (23.34 &#956;mol/h) under the same conditions. The relationship between molecular structures and PHE performance has been systematically investigated by the photophysical properties of organic dyes and the strength of IEF at dye/PCN interface. It afforded an efficient strategy to balance the charge transfer process in PHE systems, which can guide the molecular design of organic dyes with optimized aggregated behaviors and stable excited triplet states.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosynthesis of H2O2 using Phenothiazine&#8208;Based Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mimicking Coenzyme Q</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking natural enzymes through artificial enzyme engineering represents a powerful strategy to fine&#8208;tune the performance of photocatalysts, while the manipulation of electron transfer systems through atomic precision control is challenging. Herein, we reported a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on progressively oxidized phenothiazine (PTH) core as the platform for emulating Coenzyme Q, achieved through meticulous stepwise adjustments of their redox states. Compared to the original PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, the COFs with incrementally oxidized sulfur sites exhibited enhanced charge transfer efficiencies, facilitating efficient electron donation to O2 and thereby providing a favorable pathway for H2O2 synthesis. Notably, the PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF achieved a remarkable synthesis rate of 7755 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, marking a 720% improvement over the PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF baseline. Furthermore, in the presence of a sacrificial agent, this rate soared to an impressive 13565 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, surpassing the most reported photo&#8208;active COFs. In situ characterizations and simulations verified that three H2O2 evolution pathways (2e&#8208; ORR, 4e&#8208; OER, and 4e&#8208; ORR) all involved in the H2O2 production process. As a result, our findings introduce a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through the innovative application of artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Reversed Functionalization of Aliphatic Aldehydes via Divergent Nickel Hydride Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;hydride catalyzed, polarity&#8208;reversed approach for divergent activation and functionalization of aliphatic aldehydes is reported. This mild and operationally simple process enables the transformation of a wide variety of readily available aliphatic aldehydes, along with alkyl or aryl electrophiles, into the corresponding secondary alcohols or more challenging deoxygenated alkanes with excellent chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Divergent catalysis represents an exciting frontier for unlocking molecular structural diversity and exploring new activation modes. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of polarity&#8208;reversed divergent activation and functionalization of aliphatic aldehydes, where enolizable aliphatic aldehydes are selectively activated by nickel hydride to form two distinct alkylnickel intermediates divergently. This mild and operationally simple process enables the transformation of a wide variety of readily available aliphatic aldehydes, along with alkyl or aryl electrophiles, into the corresponding secondary alcohols or more challenging deoxygenated alkanes with excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Operando Evolution of a Hybrid Metallic Alloy Interphase for Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operando&#8208;evolved metallic alloy interphase is proposed to achieve all&#8208;round protection for Zn metal anodes. This interphase, consisting of AgxZny alloy and metallic In, synergistically facilitates the migration of zinc ions through the protective layer and induces their planar deposition. Consequently, the Zn@(Ag&#8722;In)||ZnVO full cells demonstrated an excellent capacity retention of 90.2&#8201;% over 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely acknowledged as viable future energy storage solutions, particularly for low&#8208;cost stationary applications. However, the interfacial instability of zinc anodes represents a major challenge to the commercial potential of Zn&#8208;ion systems, promoting an array of side reactions including spontaneous corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth that destabilize cell performance, lower Coulombic efficiency and ultimately lead to early cell failure. While other commercially relevant battery systems benefit from a spontaneously forming solid electrolyte interphase, no such layer forms in AZIBs. Herein, we have designed and engineered an operando evolved metallic alloy interphase for AZIBs. This interfacial layer is initially deposited in the form of a thin film of Ag and In, but develops in situ to become an intimate mix of an AgxZny alloy and metallic indium. Importantly, this dual&#8208;heterometallic layer acts to synergistically regulate the migration of zinc ions through the alloy interphase and enables the dense and planar deposition of Zn, simultaneously overcoming all major drivers of Zn anode degradation. Symmetric and full cells containing this modified metallic zinc anode exhibit stable electrochemical performance, offering high&#8208;capacity retention. Hence, this scalable approach represents a viable route towards the commercial utilization of this energy storage system.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis and Applications of Stereogenic &#946;&#8242;&#8208;Methyl Enones and &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;Dimethyl Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily available &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene enones has been realized with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical and atom&#8208;economic construction of enantioenriched &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methyl enones that are difficult to access by other methods. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethylene ketones. The synthetic utilities of this methodology have been well demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products, and two spirocyclic diols.







Abstract
The &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; effect has received tremendous interest in medicinal chemistry due to the significant pharmacological and physical modification of properties that have been observed upon introducing a methyl group, especially, a stereogenic methyl group into potential chiral drug candidates. The prevalence of stereogenic &#946;&#8208;methyl ketone structural motifs in bioactive compounds and natural products has long motivated the development of enantioselective strategies toward their synthesis. Herein, we have rationally designed a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily&#8208;available &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene conjugated enones with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical construction of enantioenriched &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methyl unsaturated enones that are difficult to access by other methods. Control experiments revealed that the conjugated C=C bond in &#946;&#8242;&#8208;methylene conjugated enones plays a significant role in enhancing the reactivity of monohydrogenation. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dimethylene ketones. Detailed mechanistic investigation and DFT studies further provided strong support for a unique processive catalysis pathway for double asymmetric hydrogenation. The synthetic utilities have been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for bioactive molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone and (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone, and two C2&#8208;symmetric chiral spirocyclic diol frameworks.

This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;-dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;-dimethylene ketones. The synthetic utilities of this methodology have been well demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for biologically important chiral molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products, and two spirocyclic diols.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; effect has received tremendous interest in medicinal chemistry due to the significant pharmacological and physical modification of properties that have been observed upon introducing a methyl group, especially, a stereogenic methyl group into potential chiral drug candidates. The prevalence of stereogenic &#946;-methyl ketone structural motifs in bioactive compounds and natural products has long motivated the development of enantioselective strategies toward their synthesis. Herein, we have rationally designed a Rh-catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily-available &#946;&#8242;-methylene conjugated enones with high efficiency and remarkable site-selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical construction of enantioenriched &#946;&#8242;-methyl unsaturated enones that are difficult to access by other methods. Control experiments revealed that the conjugated C=C bond in &#946;&#8242;-methylene conjugated enones plays a significant role in enhancing the reactivity of monohydrogenation. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;&#8242;-dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;&#8242;-dimethylene ketones. Detailed mechanistic investigation and DFT studies further provided strong support for a unique processive catalysis pathway for double asymmetric hydrogenation. The synthetic utilities have been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for bioactive molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-(+)-&lt;i&gt;ar&lt;/i&gt;-Turmerone and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-(+)-dihydro-&lt;i&gt;ar&lt;/i&gt;-Turmerone, and two &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric chiral spirocyclic diol frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Crystalline Phase/Plane of Polymer Electrolyte for Rapid Lithium Ion Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insight into the mechanism of crystal phase and plane exerts on the transfer of lithium ion in poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) based polymer electrolytes is investigated in depth. &#946;&#8208;phase&#8208;dominant segments are obtained by regulating dissolving process and the newly exposed (111/201)&#946; crystal planes are conducive to provide more ion transport channels, which is beneficial to the rapid and smooth transfer of lithium ion.







Abstract
Electronic&#8208;rich functional groups and flexible segments have long been perceived to be the decisive factors influencing lithium&#8208;ion transfer in polymer electrolytes, while crystallinity is regarded as the great scourge. Actually, the research on the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane is still in scarcity. Herein, taking poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as an example, new (111/201) crystal planes (belonged to &#946;&#8208;phase) are regulated by dissolving process and clarified by Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory calculation indicates that the newly exposed (111/201) crystal planes provide higher binding energy with lithium ions and are conducive to provide more ion transport channels. 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance of new crystalline planes contained PVDF&#8208;HFP based electrolyte shows lower field and sharper peak intensity, further proves the rapid lithium ion transfer. Therefore, a high ionic conductivity of 6.42&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a large lithium&#8208;ion transfer number of 0.7 are achieved. This study offers a new insight into the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane on the transfer of lithium ion for polymer electrolytes.

         <title>The Intrinsic Fluorescence of Peptide Self&#8208;Assemblies Across pH Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation deciphers the pivotal role of main&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding in peptide self&#8208;assembly as the primary source of intrinsic fluorescence. It demonstrates how pH&#8208;induced morphological diversity in peptides maintains fixed fluorescence peaks through the integrity of these bonding networks, while fluorescence intensity is modulated by structural variations. The study preliminarily unveils the fluorescence properties and regulatory mechanisms of self&#8208;assembled peptides.







Abstract
The regulation of solution pH on the structural and optical properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies remains a critical yet unresolved issue in peptide research. This study investigates the heptapeptide Ac&#8208;IHIHIQI&#8208;NH2 and its intrinsic fluorescence across a range of pH levels, demonstrating that variations in pH lead to significant changes in the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures. While the position of the fluorescence emission remains constant&#8212;due to the stability provided by the hydrogen bonding network of the peptide backbone&#8212;the intensity of the fluorescence exhibits a direct correlation with the degree of self&#8208;assembly. This finding underscores a dynamic relationship between structural morphology and optical properties. Notably, the ability of the peptide to self&#8208;assemble under diverse pH conditions is a novel observation that contrasts with previously reported literature. By employing a computationally driven approach, complemented by rigorous experimental validation, this work establishes a new paradigm for studying complex interacting systems such as peptide self&#8208;assembly. Our findings enhance the understanding of how environmental factors influence peptide behavior and pave the way for the design of innovative peptide&#8208;based materials with tunable optical characteristics, with potential applications in bioluminescent probes and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Enzymatic Reaction Network&#8208;Driven Polymerization&#8208;Induced Transient Coacervation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic reaction network (ERN) for polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system: polymerization, coacervation, dissolution and selective cargo uptake.







Abstract
A living cell has a highly complex microenvironment whereas numerous enzyme&#8208;driven processes are active at once. These procedures are incredibly accurate and efficient, although comparable control has not yet been established in vitro. Here, we design an enzymatic reaction network (ERN) that combines antagonistic and orthogonal enzymatic networks to produce adjustable dynamics of ATP&#8208;fueled transient coacervation. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mediated Biocatalytic Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (BioATRP), we synthesized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), which subsequently formed coacervates with ATP. We rationally explored enzymatic control over coacervation and dissolution, using orthogonal and antagonistic enzyme pairs viz., alkaline phosphatase, Creatine phosphokinase, hexokinase, esterase, and urease. ATP&#8208;fuelled coacervates also demonstrate the enzymatic catalysis to prove its potential to be exploited as a cellular microreactor. Additionally, we developed ERN&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system, polymerization, coacervation, and dissolution. Notably, the coacervation process itself determines functional properties, as seen in selective cargo uptake. The strategy offers cutting&#8208;edge biomimetic applications, and insights into cellular compartmentalization by bridging the gap between synthetic and biological systems. The development of temporally programmed coacervation is promising for the spatial arrangement of multienzyme cascades, and offers novel ideas on the architecture of artificial cells.

         <title>Heterochiral Self&#8208;Discrimination Driven Dimerization of Polynuclear Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Complexes with Enhanced Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral heterodimer icosanuclear meso&#8208;cluster (mesoSDP&#8208;Au20) has been obtained by simply mixing decanuclear chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters (SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10) in a 1:1 ratio. The dimerization process with heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination has been found to be sensitive to the solvent polarity and configuration of the diphosphine ligand.







Abstract
Decanuclear chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters (SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10) have been assembled by taking advantage of the judiciously selected SDP ligands (SDP = 7,7&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane). Interestingly, an achiral heterodimer icosanuclear meso&#8208;cluster (mesoSDP&#8208;Au20) has been obtained by simply mixing SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10 in a 1:1 ratio. These gold(I) complexes have been found to display intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence with an emission maximum at around 750&#8197;nm in the solid state. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of mesoSDP&#8208;Au20 in drop&#8208;cast solid&#8208;state thin film has been found to show a significant enhancement from 8&#8201;% in the SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10 to 25&#8201;%. In addition, the dimerization process with heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination has been found to be sensitive to the solvent polarity and configuration of the diphosphine ligand. This work has provided a platform for the investigation and mechanistic understanding of heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and assembly processes.

         <title>A Scalable Pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned Metal&#8208;organic Framework Powered by Polycatenation Strategy for Efficient Acetylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D&#8594;3D polycatenation strategy is firstly proposed to construct a scalable pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned metal&#8208;organic framework (PSP MOF) with functional N/O sites to balance C2H2 uptake and selectivity by optimizing pore size and host&#8208;guest interactions in the custom&#8208;designed pore. The breakthrough experiments reveal impressive C2H2 productivity from binary and ternary mixtures with excellent recyclability after 20 cycles for separating C2H2/CO2.







Abstract
Efficient separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4) is a significant challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their similar physicochemical properties. Pore space partition (PSP) has shown promise in enhancing gas adsorption capacity and selectivity by reducing pore size and increasing the density of guest binding sites. Herein, we firstly employ the 2D&#8594;3D polycatenation strategy to construct a PSP metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy, incorporating functional N/O sites to enhance C2H2 purification. The polycatenated framework with optimized pore size and regularity, exhibiting significant improvements over traditional PSP MOFs by resolving the critical contradiction of balancing C2H2 uptake (98.5&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8201;K, 100&#8197;kPa) and selectivity of C2H2/CO2 (3.4), C2H2/C2H4 (5.9), and C2H2/CH4 (96.4) in a MOF. Breakthrough experiments confirm high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and high C2H2 productivity from binary and ternary mixtures. Notably, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy exhibits excellent water stability, scalability, and regenerability after 20 cycles for separating C2H2/CO2. Theoretical calculations verify that the strong binding of C2H2 is mainly attributed to the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/N interactions between host Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy and guest C2H2 molecules. The polycatenation strategy not only improved industrial C2H2 purification efficiency but also enriched the design diversity of customized MOFs for other gas separation applications.

         <title>Modulating the Coverage of Adsorbed Hydrogen via Hydrogen Spillover Enables Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modulated the surface coverage of adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) on Pt via hydrogen spillover in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst (Pt/TiO2), which exhibited a high selectivity (94&#8201;%) and good Faradaic efficiency (FE, 63&#8201;%) for cyclohexanone. We revealed that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributed to low adsorbed hydrogen species coverage over Pt, which effectively hindered over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol is a sustainable route to produce cyclohexanone, an industrially important feedstock for polymer synthesis. However, attaining high selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) for cyclohexanone remain challenging, owning to over&#8208;hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol and competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by employing hydrogen spillover effect, we modulate adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) coverage on Pt surface via migration to TiO2 in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. In ECH of phenol, a high selectivity (94&#8201;%) and good FE (63&#8201;%) for cyclohexanone are obtained, showing more advantageous performance compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Hads migrated from Pt to TiO2. We propose that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributes to low Hads coverage over Pt, which effectively hinders over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER. We establish a scaling relationship between the intensity of hydrogen spillover and cyclohexanone selectivity by varying the types of anatase TiO2, and show the universality of the strategy over other reducible metal oxides as the support (rutile TiO2, CeO2 and WO3). This work showcases an effective strategy for tuning hydrogenation selectivity in electro&#8208;catalysis, by taking advantage of thermo&#8208;catalytically well&#8208;documented hydrogen spillover effect.

         <title>The Influence of Alkyl Spacers and Molecular Weight on the Charge Transport and Storage Properties of Oxy&#8208;Bithiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mismatch in polarity between polymer side chains and their solvation environment can lead to segmental aggregation, causing the flexible backbone to twist and, subsequently, deteriorate the polymer&#8216;s electronic properties.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) with polar side chains can conduct electronic and ionic charges simultaneously, making them promising for bioelectronics, electrocatalysis and energy storage. Recent work showed that adding alkyl spacers between CP backbones and polar side chains improved electronic charge carrier mobility, reduced swelling and enhanced stability, without compromising ion transport. However, how alkyl spacers impact polymer backbone conformation and, subsequently, electronic properties remain unclear. In this work, we design two oxy&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;based CP series, each featuring progressively extended alkyl spacer lengths and two distinct molecular weight (MW) distributions. Using operando characterisations, we evaluate the (spectro)electrochemical and swelling properties of the polymer thin films, and their performance in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors. Surprisingly, alkyl spacers negatively impact the hole mobility of our polymers, with higher MW amplifying this effect. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that it is thermodynamically favourable for adjacent non&#8208;polar alkyl spacers to aggregate in polar electrolytes, leading to backbone twisting. Further spectroscopic measurements corroborate this prediction. Our findings demonstrate the active interactions between side chain structure, MW and electrolyte/solvent polarity in influencing polymer performance, underscoring the importance of considering solvation environment effects on polymer conformation when designing new mixed conducting CPs for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Free Anti&#8208;Perovskite with Strong Chiroptical Nonlinearity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite is constructed, which exhibits strong nonlinear chiroptical property. The second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism of the chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite reaches 0.60. Moreover, owing to the outstanding optical transparency of R&#8208;MCN and S&#8208;MCN, they exhibit a high LDT of 71&#8197;mJ/cm2, which is larger than that of most chiral perovskites.







Abstract
The nonlinear chiroptical properties of chiral metal halide perovskite has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In order to overcome the inherent limitations of metal halide, such as high costs, potential toxicity, challenges with recycling, especially the limited laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT), we have successfully constructed the first chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite, with the aim of utilizing it in second harmonic generation&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Moreover, the anti&#8208;perovskite composed entirely of small organic ions typically display a more extensive transparent window, which could contribute a high LDT. Herein two chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskites, R/S&#8208;MCN [(R/S&#8208;MBA)6Cl(NH4Cl6)] were constructed, and exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response from 800 to 980&#8197;nm. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of the chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite reaches 0.89&#8197;pm/V, which is higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Most importantly, both R&#8208; and S&#8208;MCN exhibit a large nonlinear optical activity with a high SHG dissymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.60 and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 71&#8197;mJ/cm2, which is higher than that of most reported chiral perovskites. Our findings indicate that chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite have the potential to be a valuable addition to the development of next&#8208;generation nonlinear chiroptical devices.

&lt;p&gt;The first chiral metal-free anti-perovskite is constructed, which exhibits strong nonlinear chiroptical property. The second-harmonic generation circular dichroism of the chiral metal-free anti-perovskite reaches 0.60. Moreover, owing to the outstanding optical transparency of &lt;i&gt;R-&lt;/i&gt;MCN and &lt;i&gt;S-&lt;/i&gt;MCN, they exhibit a high LDT of 71&#8197;mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is larger than that of most chiral perovskites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonlinear chiroptical properties of chiral metal halide perovskite has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In order to overcome the inherent limitations of metal halide, such as high costs, potential toxicity, challenges with recycling, especially the limited laser-induced damage threshold (LDT), we have successfully constructed the first chiral metal-free anti-perovskite, with the aim of utilizing it in second harmonic generation-circular dichroism (SHG-CD). Moreover, the anti-perovskite composed entirely of small organic ions typically display a more extensive transparent window, which could contribute a high LDT. Herein two chiral metal-free anti-perovskites, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MCN [(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] were constructed, and exhibit strong second-harmonic generation response from 800 to 980&#8197;nm. The second-order nonlinear optical coefficient of the chiral metal-free anti-perovskite reaches 0.89&#8197;pm/V, which is higher than that of commercial Y-cut quartz. Most importantly, both &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MCN exhibit a large nonlinear optical activity with a high SHG dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SHG-CD&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.60 and a high laser-induced damage threshold of 71&#8197;mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is higher than that of most reported chiral perovskites. Our findings indicate that chiral metal-free anti-perovskite have the potential to be a valuable addition to the development of next-generation nonlinear chiroptical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Molecular Design for Balanced Locally Excited and Charge&#8208; Transfer Nature for Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Phenomenon and Highly Efficient TADF&#8208;Based OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic modulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugation and electron&#8208;donating strengths has been used to induce hybridized localized electronic and charge&#8208;transfer characters. This has led to donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (&#960;&#8208;DAD) structures showing a maintained elevated two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section value and highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
The pursuit of highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) character is hampered by the concurrent achievement of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL). Here, by introducing a terephthalonitrile unit into a sterically crowded donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structure, inducing a hybrid electronic excitation character, we designed unique TADF emitters possessing 2PA ability. This rational molecular design was achieved through a main &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor backbone in line with locally excited feature renders a large oscillator strength and transition dipole moment, maintaining a high 2PA cross&#8208;section value. The ancillary N&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor with charge transfer character highly balances the TADF phenomenon by minimizing &#916;EST. A near&#8208;unity &#934;PL value with a large radiative decay rate over an order of magnitude higher than the intersystem crossing rate and a high horizontal orientation ratio of 0.95 were simultaneously attained for TPCz2NP. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with this material exhibit a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% with an elevated 2PA cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) value up to 143&#8197;GM at 850&#8197;nm. These findings offer a venue for designing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional performance inclusive of 2PA properties, expanding for future functional material design.

         <title>A FRET Autophagy Imaging Platform by Macrocyclic Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the robust assembly and broad&#8208;spectrum encapsulation of macrocyclic amphiphiles, we developed a FRET&#8208;based autophagy imaging platform that demonstrates versatility and convenience as a powerful tool for imaging organelle autophagy.







Abstract
Autophagy is a ubiquitous process of organelle interaction in eukaryotic cells, in which various organelles or proteins are recycled and operated through the autophagy pathway to ensure nutrient and energy homeostasis. Although numerous fluorescent probes have been developed to image autophagy, these environment&#8208;responsive probes suffer from inherent deficiencies such as inaccuracy and limited versatility. Here, we present a modular macrocyclic amphiphile F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) platform (SC6A12C/NCM, SN), constructed through the amphiphilic assembly of sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SC6A12C) with N&#8208;cetylmorpholine (NCM) for lysosome targeting. The hydrophobic fluorophore BPEA (FRET donor) was entrapped within the inner hydrophobic phase and showed strong fluorescence emission. Attributed to the broad&#8208;spectrum encapsulation of SC6A12C, three commercially available organelle probes (Mito&#8208;Tracker Red, ER Tracker Red, and RhoNox&#8208;1) were selected as SC6A12C guests (FRET acceptors). During autophagy process, the formation of intracellular host&#8211;guest complexes leads to strong FRET signal, allowing us to visualize the fusion of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus with lysosomes, respectively. This study provides a versatile and accessible platform for imaging organelle autophagy.

         <title>Structural and Functional Characterization of an Amidase Targeting a Polyurethane for Sustainable Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Global plastic production has surged in recent decades, leading to significant environmental waste. With a focus on polyurethane (PUR), the high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase SP3 in a product&#8208;bound state has been solved. Kinetic studies and enzyme engineering guided by the structure identified key structural elements that enhance urethanase activity, thereby supporting future PUR degradation and sustainable recycling efforts.







Abstract
Global plastic production exceeded 400 million tons in 2022, urgently demanding improved waste management and recycling strategies for a circular plastic economy. While the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become feasible on industrial scales, efficient enzymes targeting other hydrolyzable plastic types, such as polyurethanes (PURs), are lacking. Recently, enzymes of the amidase signature (AS) family, capable of cleaving urethane bonds in a polyether&#8208;PUR analog and a linear polyester&#8208;PUR, have been identified. Herein, we present high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the AS enzyme UMG&#8208;SP3 in three states: ligand&#8208;free, bound with a suicidal inhibitor mimicking the transition state, and bound with a monomeric PUR degradation product. Besides revealing the conserved core and catalytic triad akin to other AS family members, the UMG&#8208;SP3 structures show remarkable flexibility of loop regions. Particularly, Arg209 in loop 3 adopts two induced&#8208;fit conformations upon ligand binding. Through structure&#8208;guided kinetic studies and enzyme engineering, we mapped structural key elements that determine the enhanced hydrolysis of urethane and amide bonds in various small molecules, including a linear PUR fragment analog. Our findings contribute critical insights into urethanase activity, aiding PUR degradation campaigns and sustainable plastic recycling efforts in the future.

         <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Lipid Vesicles in a Coacervate&#8208;Based Compartmentalized System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We hereby present the generation of lipid vesicles under relatively low concentrations of lipid molecules (approximately 1&#8197;mM) and mild conditions within coacervate microdroplets. This finding suggests that analogous processes could have taken place on the early Earth, providing a novel perspective on the conditions conducive to the development of cellular systems. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of non&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics in the formation of organized functional compartments. It elucidates that the binding energy between surfactants and oppositely charged components, which constitute the coacervate microdroplet, plays a pivotal role in governing the spatiotemporal distribution of surfactants within the coacervate microdroplet.







Abstract
The spontaneous emergence of lipid vesicles in the absence of evolved biological machinery represents a major challenge for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. We show that coacervate microdroplets could create a compartmentalized environment that enriches lipid molecules and facilitates their spontaneous assembly into lipid vesicles. These vesicles can escape from the coacervate microdroplets in a continuous process under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, resembling a constant production process akin to a &#8220;primitive enzyme&#8221; factory assembly line. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the intricate interaction between lipid molecules and coacervate microdroplets, shedding light on the emergence of cellular systems and offering a new perspective on the conditions necessary for the development of life on Earth.

         <title>Supercritical Ethane Processing of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes towards Pressure&#8208;Resistant C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneered the preparation of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes using supercritical ethane as solvent. Owing to its high diffusivity, low viscosity, and chemical inertness, grain boundary defects could be largely eliminated, resulting in superior and pressure&#8208;resistant C3H6/C3H8 separation performances.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have shown great promise in industrial&#8208;scale C3H6/C3H8 separation. Nonetheless, sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes remains a grand challenge. In this study, we pioneered the use of supercritical ethane (scC2H6) as reaction medium for preparing pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Membrane growth in neutral organic environment was proven to have less disturbance to structure integrity compared with supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Gas permeation results indicated that obtained ZIF&#8208;8 membrane exhibited an ideal C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 172.1 with C3H6 permeance of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pa&#8722;1. Of particular note, the membrane maintained stable C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of ~150 with C3H6 flux of ~1.6&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 at operation pressure of 6&#8197;bar, which was significantly different from ZIF&#8208;8 membranes obtained from scCO2 reaction medium. Through combining with advantages of zero pollutant discharge and full ligand recovery, our protocol holds great promise in sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes towards practical application in high&#8208;purity C3H6 production.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Cascade Nanosystems for Spatiotemporally Controlled Gene&#8208;Silencing and Gas Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;triggered cascade effect system is developed to achieve precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This strategy harnesses the power of NIR&#8208;induced NO release to orchestrate the relocation of APE1, thereby achieving enhanced efficiency and spatiotemporal controllability of gene silencing.







Abstract
Despite the tremendous potential of DNAzymes in gene therapy, achieving gene regulation with spatiotemporal precision and satisfactory efficacy remains a key challenge. Herein, we developed a near&#8208;infrared light (NIR)&#8208;triggered cascade effect system that enables precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This nanoplatform was constructed using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme, a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The UCNPs act as light converters, facilitating the precursor to produce NO under NIR light irradiation, while the generated NO not only participates directly in gas therapy but also induces the upregulation of cytoplasmic APE1 level, resulting in enhanced DNAzyme activation and spatially controlled gene silencing. By leveraging this mechanism, cascade effects mediated gas&#8208;gene synergistic therapy is achieved through the combination of NIR light&#8208;controlled NO release and APE1&#8208;activatable gene therapy. We demonstrated that this nanoplatform enables enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy represents a critical step forward in the quest for highly targeted and efficient cancer treatments.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Induced Spin&#8208;State Switching Based on Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature and light&#8208;dependent synergistic switching effects in magnetic, structural, and spectral properties have been discovered for a three&#8208;dimensional spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material [FeII(4&#8208;acetylpyridine)2][HgII(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4]. Tunable terahertz absorption through temperature and light stimuli is associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers through SCO behavior supported by ab initio calculation.







Abstract
The development of molecular switches with tunable properties has garnered considerable interest over several decades. A novel spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material based on iron(II) complexes incorporating 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;acpy) and [Hg(SCN)4]2&#8722; anions was synthesized and formulated as [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2][Hg(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4] (1). Compound 1 is crystallized in a three&#8208;dimensional network in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Pna21 with two octahedral [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2(NCS)4] entities featuring two distinct Fe centers (Fe1 and Fe2). Crystallographic, magnetic, and M&#246;ssbauer measurements reveal an incomplete SCO exclusively at Fe2, with transition temperature T1/2&#8776;102&#8197;K. Photomagnetic studies conducted at 10&#8197;K with lasers ranging from 405 to 1310&#8197;nm evidence light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (LIESST) and reverse&#8208;LIESST effects, with a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LIESST phenomenon at 1064 and 1310&#8197;nm. Advanced photocrystallographic studies at 40&#8197;K provide precise structural evidence for these metastable states. The optical and vibrational properties consistently corroborate with magnetic and photomagnetic studies. Additionally, temperature&#8208; and light&#8208;dependent terahertz (THz) absorptions are associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers, through SCO behavior, as supported by ab initio calculation. The Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) systems can be promising benchmarks for exploring synergistic switching effects in structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Rapidly Generated, Ultra&#8208;Stable, and Switchable Photoinduced Radicals: A Solid&#8208;State Photochromic Paradigm for Reusable Paper Light&#8208;Writing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapidly responsive and ultra&#8208;stable photoinduced radical platform was constructed by the anti&#8208;parallelly aligned para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes. The ultra&#8208;fast high&#8208;contrast photochromism upon UV irradiation is stable for 3&#8197;months in dark. The superior photochromic behavior also remains in the ground sample, for which it can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing.







Abstract
Although photochromic molecules have attracted widespread interest in various fields, solid&#8208;state photochromism remains a formidable challenge, owing to the substantial conformational constraints that hinder traditional molecular photoisomerization processes. Benefiting from the significant color change upon radical generation, chemical systems enabling a photoinduced radical (PIR) behavior through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) could be ideal candidates for solid&#8208;state photochromism within minimized need of conformational freedom. However, the transient nature of radicals causes a dilemma in this Scheme. Herein, we present a general crystal engineering strategy for rapidly generated (7&#8208;s irradiation to saturation) and ultra&#8208;stable (lasting 12&#8197;weeks) PIRs in the solid state, based on the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes to form a strong non&#8208;covalent network for efficient PET and radical stabilization. Using this strategy, a PIR platform was constructed, with a superior photochromic behavior remaining in different solid forms (even in the fully&#8208;ground sample) due to their transcendent crystallization ability. On this basis, our compounds can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing, accompanied by water fumigation for modulating the reversible process. This work provides new insights into addressing solid&#8208;state photochromism and can inspire a wide range of optical material design from the switchable radical perspective.

         <title>A Kinetically Stabilized Dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;Indacene: Stable Kekul&#233; Diradical Polycyclic Hydrocarbon with Triplet Ground State</title>

         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized and isolated a stable triplet&#8208;ground&#8208;state Kekul&#233; diradical polycyclic hydrocarbon &#8211; a kinetically blocked derivative of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. Its triplet ground state was unequivocally confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements, and its structure and electronic properties were revealed. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion were also studied.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) hold significant potential in organic spintronics and organic magnets. However, their synthesis is very challenging due to their extremely high reactivity. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of a kinetically blocked derivative (1) of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene, which represents a rare persistent triplet diradical of a Kekul&#233; PH. Its triplet ground state was unambiguously confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements. Its structure was also unequivocally confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. The key design principle is to extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation for achieving the decrease of the bonding interaction and the increase of the exchange interaction between unpaired electrons, which are essential for accessing the stable triplet ground state. Due to kinetic blocking, 1 shows a reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of 64&#8197;h under ambient conditions. It has a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. Notably, its dication and dianion exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state and near&#8208;infrared absorption, and the structures were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. This study will shed new light on the design and synthesis of novel stable PHs with high&#8208;spin multiplicity.

         <title>Promoting Alcohols Electrooxidation Coupled with Hydrogen Production via Asymmetric Pulse Potential Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy was developed to promote the regeneration of active oxygen species which contribute to satble catalysis by noble metal catalysts for various alcohol oxidation reactions. Distinguished from conventional potentiostatic strategy, the operation time of stable glycerol oxidation electrocatalyzed by Pd was extended from 6&#8197;h to more than 2800&#8197;h under universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic organic oxidation coupled with hydrogen (H2) production emerges as a profitable solution to simultaneously reduce overall energy consumption of H2 production and synthetic high&#8208;value chemicals. Noble metal catalysts are highly efficient electrocatalysts in oxidation reactions, but they deactivate easily weakening the benefit in actual production. Herein, we report a universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy to achieve long&#8208;term stable operation of noble metals for various alcohol oxidation reactions and noble metal catalysts. For example, by pulsed potentials between 0.8&#8197;V and 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, palladium (Pd)&#8208;catalyzed glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation can continuously proceed for more than 2800&#8197;h with glyceric acid (GLA) selectivity of &gt;70&#8201;%. Whereas, Pd electrocatalyst becomes nearly deactivated within 6&#8197;h of reaction under conventional potentiostatic strategy. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated electrophilic OH* from H2O/OH&#8722; oxidation on Pd (denoted as Pd&#8722;OH*) acts as main active species for GLY oxidation. However, Pd&#8722;OH* is prone to be oxidized to PdOx resulting in performance decay. When a short reduction potential (e.g., 0&#8197;V vs. RHE for 5&#8197;s) is powered, PdOx can be reversibly reduced to restore the current. Moreover, we tested the feasibility of this strategy in a flow electrolyzer, verifying the practical application potential.

         <title>Optical Control of TRPM8 Channels with Photoswitchable Menthol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM), the first photoswitchable activator of the TRPM8 channel. AzoM enables precise and reversible optical control of TRPM8, facilitating detailed analysis of current kinetics. This allows for deeper insights into the specific roles of individual amino acids in channel gating, AzoM binding, and phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2) binding and sensitization.







Abstract
Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels are well known as sensors for cold temperatures and cooling agents such as menthol and icilin and these channels are tightly regulated by the membrane lipid phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2). Since TRPM8 channels emerged as promising drug targets for treating pain, itching, obesity, cancer, dry eye disease, and inflammation, we aimed at developing a high&#8208;precision TRPM8 channel activator, to achieve spatiotemporal control of TRPM8 activity with light. In this study, we designed, synthesized and characterized the first photoswitchable TRPM8 activator azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM). AzoM enables optical control of endogenously and heterologously expressed TRPM8 channels with UV and blue light which is demonstrated by performing patch&#8208;clamp experiments. Moreover, AzoM facilitates the reliable determination of activation, inactivation, and deactivation kinetics thereby providing further insights into the channel gating. Using AzoM, the specific roles of individual amino acids for AzoM or PIP2 binding and for sensitization by PIP2 can be elucidated. Altogether, AzoM represents as a high&#8208;precision pharmaceutical tool for reversible control of TRPM8 channel function that enhances our biophysical understanding of TRPM8 channels and holds the potential to support the development of novel pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Fused vs 575&#8208;Ringed Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Selective Synthesis, Reactivity and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Scholl reaction has been used for the selective synthesis of two different boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems: an unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization as well as the desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The two products have fully distinct chemical reactivities, electronic structures, and photophysical properties.







Abstract
Incorporation of heteroatoms and/or non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can alter their intrinsic structures and physical properties. However, it is challenging to construct PAHs featuring boron/carbon composition and non&#8208;hexagonal combination. Herein, we disclose the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;type and pentagon/heptagon&#8208;containing boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems by the Scholl reaction. Two spiro&#8208;fused organoboranes 1 and 2 and one 575&#8208;ringed boron&#8208;doped nanographene 3 were synthesized. The key point is that the boron&#8208;edged &#960;&#8208;system enabled unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization, whereas the boron&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;system enabled desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The thus&#8208;obtained molecules exhibit the intriguing but fully distinct reactivity, electronic structures and properties, for instance, while 2 may react with Br&#248;nsted acid to display reversible chemochromism and further convert into 1, 3 possesses very broad absorption, short excited&#8208;state lifetime and no fluorescence nature. As disclosed, the boron atom together with the spirocycle region or 575&#8208;ringed structural motif significantly contribute to their characteristic properties. Thus, this study sheds light on control over the Scholl reaction using organoborane &#960;&#8208;systems and will promote the exploration of more sophisticated polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems as organic reactive and optical scaffolds.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Benzo&#8208;Phenoselenazine Derivatives for Multi&#8208;Subcellular Biomolecule Profiling</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue (SeNB) derivatives enable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;activated proximity labeling of biomolecules via a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mediated pathway in the presence of propargylamine. SeNB core efficiently generates 1O2 in lipid&#8208;rich environments while the tailored tail structures allow for selective targeting of different organelle membranes. This strategic combination achieves wash&#8208;free proximity labeling, bypassing genetic manipulation and compatible with multiple cell lines.







Abstract
Elucidating the subcellular localization of RNAs and proteins is fundamental to understanding their biological functions. Genetically encoded proteins/enzymes provide an attractive approach to target many proteins of interest, but are limited to specific cell lines. Although small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based methods have been explored, a comprehensive system for profiling multiple locations in living cells, comparable to fusion&#8208;protein techniques, is yet to be established. In this study, we introduce a novel proximity labeling strategy employing a suite of small molecules derived from benzo&#8208;phenoselenazine (e.g., selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue [SeNB]), which achieves proximity labeling through singlet oxygen generation upon near&#8208;infrared light activation in the presence of propargylamine. These SeNB compounds allow for selective labeling of RNAs and proteins within living cells, exhibiting a distinct preference for organelle membranes, which are systematically investigated via in vitro, computational, and in cellulo examinations. Our findings highlight the capabilities of SeNB derivatives as wash&#8208;free and genetics&#8208;free approaches to illuminate the subcellular localization of biological molecules with deep penetration and high spatial resolution. Moreover, SeNB derivatives are capable of elucidating inter&#8208;organelle interactions at the molecular level, as evidenced by proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, thus holding significant potential for advancing our understanding of cellular processes related to disease progression and therapeutic development.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Enables RNA Aptamers to Function as Sensors for Reactive Inorganic Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activity&#8208;based light&#8208;up aptamer system was developed to enable a single RNA aptamer to detect non&#8208;fluorogenic and reactive inorganics. This method can easily turn E. coli into whole&#8208;cell sensors of redox species. Organic chemistry principles can advance aptamers by expanding their target scope without nucleic acid engineering or in vitro selection.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer (FLAP) systems are promising (bio)sensing platforms that are genetically encodable. However, FLAP&#8208;mediated detection of each distinct target necessitates either in vitro selection or engineering of nucleic acid sequences. Furthermore, an aptamer that binds an inorganic target or a chemical species with a short lifetime is challenging to realize. Here, we describe a small&#8208;molecule approach that makes it possible for a single FLAP system to detect chemically unique, non&#8208;fluorogenic, and reactive inorganics. We developed functionalized pre&#8208;ligands of RNA aptamers that bind benzylidene imidazolinones (Baby Spinach, Broccolli, Squash). Reactive inorganics, hydrogen sulfide (H2S/HS&#8722;) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can specifically convert these pre&#8208;ligands into native ligands that fluoresce with FLAPs. Adaptation of this platform to live cells opened an opportunity for constructing whole&#8208;cell sensors: Escherichia coli transformed with a Baby Spinach&#8208;encoding plasmid and incubated with pre&#8208;ligands generated fluorescence in response to exogenous H2S/HS&#8722; or H2O2. Leveraging the functional group reactivity of small molecules eliminates the requirement of in vitro selection of a new aptamer sequence or oligonucleotide scaffold engineering for distinct molecular targets. Our method allows for detecting inorganic, short&#8208;lived species, thereby advancing FLAP systems beyond their current capabilities.

         <title>Reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;Compatible Supercapacitor&#8208;Diode Empowering Computation Efficiency for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode, the reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) and corresponding computing blocks effectively mimic the biological system: Unidirectional ion flow is mimicked based on the significant capacitance difference; Dendritic computing is mimicked based on the tunable ion rectification; Neuromorphic computing is mimicked based on the volatile/nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage.







Abstract
Biological system utilizes unidirectional ion flow to produce and transmit signals. To realize bioinspired artificial intelligence and thus seamless human&#8208;machine interaction, ion rectification devices should be developed. Here, a reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) is developed by resettling the pseudo&#8208;capacitive and electrochemical&#8208;double&#8208;layer&#8208;capacitive components of a lithium&#8208;ion pseudocapacitor into the positive and negative voltage regions respectively through engineering the redox peaks. This CAPode exhibits good ion rectification and charge&#8208;storage bifunction with high rectification ratio (RR) (RRI~20, RRII~0.83), large areal capacitance (17&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long cycling stability (5000 cycles). More importantly, two main computing paradigms in the biological system are efficiently realized based on this CAPode by empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode: (I) multivalued ionic logic gates are constructed based on the tunable ion rectification characteristics induced by the bifunction of this CAPode for mimicking the dendritic computing; (II) all&#8208;CAPode based reservoir computing is implemented based on the reconfigurable volatile and nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage characteristics of this CAPode for mimicking the neuromorphic computing. This work paves a new way towards seamless and high&#8208;efficiency human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Alkaline Water Splitting by Porous Macrocyclic Proton Sponges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superbasic aza&#8208;calixarene&#8208;based triamine (CalixNH2) with a tripyridinic core was designed to enhance alkaline HER by facilitating proton abstraction and water splitting. Porous polymers TpCalix and DhaCalix, synthesized using CalixNH2, showed distinct performance, with TpCalix achieving an overpotential of 112(&#177;2) mV for HER and 290(&#177;2) mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A two&#8208;electrode system using TpCalix operated at 1.73&#8197;V with 12&#8197;hours of stability.







Abstract
Macrocycles are unique as they encapsulate and transfer guest molecules or ions and facilitate catalytic processes. Although metalated macrocycles are pivotal in electrocatalytic processes, using metal&#8208;free analogs has been rare. Following the strategy of Kanbara et&#8197;al., we synthesized an azacalixarene macrocycle&#8208;N, N&#8217;, N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tris(p&#8208;aminophenyl)azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine (CalixNH2). The macrocycle encapsulates a proton in its cavity, maintaining the protonation even in highly alkaline media. Notably, it retains almost 50&#8201;% protonated form in 1&#8197;M KOH (~pH&#8197;14)&#8208;acting as a proton sponge. As hydrogen evolution is complex in alkaline media owing to sluggish water dissociation, we implemented the proton sponge (CalixNH2) in an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. Conjugated Porous polymers, TpCalix and DhaCalix, have been synthesized from the triamine&#8208;CalixNH2. The most efficient catalyst, TpCalix, has shown excellent performance in alkaline HER and OER in 1&#8197;M KOH (~pH&#8197;14), with low overpotentials of only 112(&#177;2) and 290(&#177;2) mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and durable up to 24&#8197;hours. A full&#8208;cell reaction using TpCalix in both the cathode and anode exhibited a low full&#8208;cell voltage of 1.73&#8197;V and was stable for 12&#8197;hours. DFT calculations verified the tripyridinic core, which acts as the principal site for proton abstraction and binding.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing tetrameric coiled&#8208;coils into CCPO structures can improve their stability and expands the possible topologies that can be constructed. Assembling proteins from two units could be used as delivery systems, as their assembly could be controlled via external modulators. The first cryo&#8208;EM structure of a CCPO is presented.

Versatile DNA and polypeptide&#8208;based structures have been designed based on complementary modules. However, polypeptides can also form higher oligomeric states. We investigated the introduction of tetrameric modules as a substitute for coiled&#8208;coil dimerization units used in previous modular nanostructures. Tetramerizing helical bundles can run in parallel or antiparallel orientation, expanding the number of topological solutions for modular nanostructures. Furthermore, this strategy facilitates the construction of nanostructures from two identical polypeptide chains. Importantly, tetrameric modules substantially stabilized protein nanostructures against air&#8211;water interface denaturation, enabling the determination of the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy three&#8208;dimensional structure of a coiled&#8208;coil&#8208;based nanostructure, confirming the designed agreement of the modules forming a tetrahedral cage.

         <title>Latent Solvent&#8208;Induced Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interfacial Chemistry to Achieve Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed into low&#8208;concentration electrolyte to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath. The designed electrolyte exhibits enhanced oxidation resistance, low desolvation energy, and highly stable SEI film with superior potassium storage performances.







Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) have attracted great attention due to their cost effectiveness and low viscosity, but suffer undesired organic&#8208;rich interfacial chemistry and poor oxidative stability. Herein, a unique latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath and construct a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interface in a 0.5&#8197;M electrolyte. This unique solvation structure reduces the desolvation energy, facilitating rapid interfacial kinetics and K+ intercalation in graphite. Additionally, enhanced anion&#8208;cation interactions promote the formation of a thin and robust interfacial layer with excellent cycling performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Graphite||perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride full cell exhibits a good capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, and delivers a high discharge capacity of 131.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of latent solvent&#8208;optimized electrolyte engineering, providing a pathway of superior electrochemical energy storage in PIBs.

         <title>Directing Zn Growth with Biased Adsorption of Straight&#8208;chain Molecules for Superior Zn Anode Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) with double terminated polar groups was designed as an additive for the aqueous electrolyte. The hydroxyl groups firmly anchor the Scms to the Zn anode surface through horizontal adsorption, which enables high surface coverage. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that selective adsorption of Scms on Zn surface induces the deposition behavior of Zn and protects the Zn anode. The electrochemical performance of cells with Scms is significantly improved, especially at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), which have attracted attentions in the field of energy storage, is affected by dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of AZIBs. Herein, we propose a biased adsorption strategy mediated by straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) for stabilizing Zn anode. The dual polar termini of Scms guaranties securely anchor themselves in a parallel orientation upon the Zn anode surface. This provides a comprehensive coverage, effectively sequestering water molecules from the Zn anode and precipitating the formation of a water&#8208;depleted electric double layer (EDL). Furthermore, the Scms selectively adsorb along the crystallographic planes, guiding the deposition of Zn2+. Consequently, the incorporation of these Scms successfully mitigates anode corrosion, HER, and dendrites. The Zn||Zn, Zn||Cu and Zn||V6O13 cells with Scms display significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially at elevated temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights the potential of cost&#8208;effective, straight&#8208;chain electrolyte additives for enhancing Zn anode stability.

         <title>Dual Zn5&#8722;NiS4 Sites in a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Enables Efficient Cascade Catalysis for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic mechanism for efficiently cascading electrocatalytic nitrate reduction was studied in the redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;organic frameworks featuring a pentanuclear Zinc cluster and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene). The Zn5 cluster centre selectively reduces nitrate to nitrite, and the [NiS4] unit mimics nitrite reductase, facilitating the highly efficient conversion of nitrite to ammonia. This system effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions and decouples the intermediate steps in the nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, while optimizing the kinetics of consecutive hydrogenation of reaction intermediates through a highly conductive pathway, leading to highly efficient green electrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia (NO3RR) offers a promising solution to both environmental pollution and the sustainable energy conversion. Here we propose an efficient cascade catalytic mechanism based on a dual Zn5&#8722;NiS4 sites, orderly assembled in a redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;organic framework structure, which separately promotes the reaction kinetics of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;nitrite and nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversions. Specifically, the Zn5 clusters adsorb and selectively reduce the NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas [NiS4] acts as an analogue to the ferredoxins, subsequently boosts the reduction of NO2&#8722; to produce NH3. To this end, the bimetallic Zn5&#8722;NiS4TP MOF was synthesized based on the redox&#8208;active ligand [Ni(C2S2(TPCOOH)2)2]. A maximum ammonia production rate of 23477.59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and faradaic efficiency 92.87&#8201;% was achived by Zn5&#8722;NiS4TP MOF under neutral conditions. To validate the critical role of dual Zn5&#8722;NiS4 sites, Mn5&#8722;NiS4TP and Cd2&#8722;NiS4TP were synthesized as control samples, together with Zn&#8208;TTFTB, Zn&#8722;NiS4Ph and other Zn5&#8208;cluster&#8208;based MOFs applied for the investigation of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Our results indicated that substitution by &#8208;thienyl instead of &#8208;phenyl group increases the S&#8208;heteroatom content, improves the conductivity and facilitates electron transfer. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the energy changes for the reduction of each species could rationalize experimental results.

         <title>Catalytic Reductive Amination and Tandem Amination&#8211;Alkylation of Esters Enabled by a Cationic Iridium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation&#8208;enabled one&#8208;pot reductive amination and reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of common carboxylic esters to form N&#8208;alkylated, and tandem N&#8208;alkylated, &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines are described. The reactions relies on cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF, which exhibited high efficiency (at 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ir&#8208;loading, and 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;% in a 15&#8197;g scale) and good stability (alleviates the use of glovebox). {BArF=tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene}.







Abstract
Reported herein is a convenient and efficient method for one&#8208;pot, catalytic reductive amination, as well as the first multi&#8208;component tandem reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of bench&#8208;stable and readily available common carboxylic esters. This method is based on the cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective hydrosilylation of esters, followed by one&#8208;pot acid&#8208;mediated amination and nucleophilic addition. The reaction was conducted under mild conditions at a very low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ir), which could be further reduced to 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;%, as demonstrated by a reaction at a 15&#8197;g scale. The method is highly versatile, allowing the use of esters with or without &#945;&#8208;protons for the N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylation of primary and secondary amines to produce diverse secondary and tertiary amines, as well as &#945;&#8208;branched/functionalized amines. The method is highly chemoselective and tolerates a variety of functional groups such as bromo, trifluoromethyl, ester, and cyano groups. The value of the method was demonstrated by the one&#8208;step catalytic synthesis of two bio&#8208;relevant N&#8208;mono&#8208;methyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters and the antiparkinsonian agent piribedil, as well as by the use of two shorter chain triglycerides as alkylating feedstock.

&lt;p&gt;The Ir-catalyzed hydrosilylation-enabled one-pot reductive amination and reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of common carboxylic esters to form &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated, and tandem &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated, &#945;-functionalized amines are described. The reactions relies on cationic [Ir(COD)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]BArF, which exhibited high efficiency (at 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ir-loading, and 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;% in a 15&#8197;g scale) and good stability (alleviates the use of glovebox). {BArF=tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate; COD=1,5-cyclooctadiene}.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is a convenient and efficient method for one-pot, catalytic reductive amination, as well as the first multi-component tandem reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of bench-stable and readily available common carboxylic esters. This method is based on the cationic [Ir(COD)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]BArF-catalyzed chemoselective hydrosilylation of esters, followed by one-pot acid-mediated amination and nucleophilic addition. The reaction was conducted under mild conditions at a very low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ir), which could be further reduced to 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;%, as demonstrated by a reaction at a 15&#8197;g scale. The method is highly versatile, allowing the use of esters with or without &lt;i&gt;&#945;-&lt;/i&gt;protons for the &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;mono-alkylation of primary and secondary amines to produce diverse secondary and tertiary amines, as well as &lt;i&gt;&#945;-&lt;/i&gt;branched/functionalized amines. The method is highly chemoselective and tolerates a variety of functional groups such as bromo, trifluoromethyl, ester, and cyano groups.

         <title>General and Versatile Nanoarchitectonics for Amino Acid&#8208;Based Glasses via Co&#8208;Assembly of Organic Counterions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy has been developed to controllably synthesize amino acid&#8208;based glasses featuring customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable optical properties. This approach addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge of vitrifying small molecules with a strong crystallization tendency, opening avenues for the development of functional supramolecular glasses.







Abstract
Amino acid&#8208;based biomolecular glasses represent an emerging material to meet the demand for sustainable development. However, most amino acids are difficult to vitrify due to their strong crystallization tendency, limiting further advancements of this field. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of counterions effectively suppresses crystallization, as hydrogen bonds within the system stabilize the disordered structures. Based on this, we propose a counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a wide range of amino acid&#8208;based glasses. This strategy enables the facile fabrication of glass with customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable multicolor fluorescence, ranging from blue to red depending on the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, this strategy allows the integration and enhancement of counterion properties within the glass matrix. Through the co&#8208;assembly of phosphorescent counterions, we synthesized a series of long&#8208;persistent luminescent glasses with significantly extended afterglow lifetimes. This work presents an effective approach for the synthesis of amino acid&#8208;based glasses and provides insights into the development of supramolecular glasses with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion by Limiting Interfacial Hydroxyl Radicals Using Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiVO4 with surface Au nanoparticle&#8208;functionalization (BiVO4@Au) was fabricated to enable both photogeneration and in situ consumption of &#8901;OH radicals near the photocatalytic interface, leading to a much enhanced &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio for C&#8722;C coupling toward direct and efficient photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol with high selectivity is attractive but substantially challenging. The activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds at ambient conditions requires highly reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), while the presence of those oxidative species also facilitates fast formation of C1 products, instead of the kinetically sluggish C&#8722;C coupling to produce ethanol. Herein, we developed a BiVO4 photocatalyst with surface functionalization of Au nanoparticles (BiVO4@Au), which not only enables photogeneration of &#8901;OH to activate CH4 into &#8901;CH3, but also in situ consumes those &#8901;OH species to retard their further attack on &#8901;CH3, resulting in an enhanced &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio and facilitating C&#8722;C coupling toward ethanol. The &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio is further improved by transporting CH4 via a gas&#8208;diffusion layer to the photocatalytic interface, leading to even higher ethanol selectivity and production rates. At ambient conditions and without photosensitizers or sacrificial agents, the BiVO4@Au photocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion performance, including a peak ethanol yield of 680&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, a high selectivity of 86&#8201;%, and a stable photoconversion of &gt;100&#8197;h, substantially exceeding most of the previous reports. Our work suggests an attractive approach of in situ generation and modulation of the &#8901;OH levels for photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward multi&#8208;carbon products.

         <title>Ultrahigh Proton Selectivity by Assembled Cationic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up strategy with an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase for ionic covalent organic framework nanosheet fabrication is developed. The intermediate oil layer modulates the reaction rate to form a crystalline COF nanosheet with a high&#8208;aspect ratio. The resulting membrane exhibits outstanding proton selectivity over other cations.







Abstract
Ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are becoming increasingly attractive as promising two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for proton transport due to their ionic functionality and tailor&#8208;made pores. However, most synthetic methods for nanosheets rely on surface&#8208;assisted methods or phase transformation often yielding nanosheets with low aspect ratios. In this study, we present a bottom&#8208;up approach utilizing an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase system to achieve the large&#8208;scale synthesis of ionic COF nanosheets. The intermediate oil layer in this system modulates the diffusion rate of monomers from the top oil phase into the aqueous phase, enabling in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from the initial discrete fibrous structure into large and crystalline COF nanosheets. The ionic COF nanosheets exhibit excellent proton permeability while simultaneously excluding other cations by casting into crack&#8208;free membranes, demonstrating efficient HCl extraction from acidic water waste. This strategy for larger&#8208;scale COF nanosheet growth will offer an alternative platform for designing multifunctional COF membranes with applications in sophisticated separation technologies.

         <title>Control of Bilayer Transport through a Photoswitchable Membrane&#8208;Stiffening Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid bilayer membrane fluidity is altered with a photoswitchable membrane&#8208;stiffening agent based on stiff&#8208;stilbene. The fluidity increase upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization is shown to enhance the activity of known synthetic anion transporters due to an increase in mobility. Our work provides a stepping stone towards directed motion and active transport across membranes.







Abstract
The mobility of proteins in the bilayer membrane is affected by (local) changes in lipid environment, which is important to their biological functioning. Artificial molecular systems that&#8212;to some extent&#8212;imitate tasks of membrane&#8208;embedded proteins are increasingly developed, however, they are usually controlled through responsive units in their core structure. Here we present an alternative approach based on an amphiphilic stiff&#8208;stilbene derivative that enables control of membrane fluidity by light. The fluidity increase upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization is shown to enhance the activity of known synthetic anion transporters as a result of a higher mobility. The photoisomerization process is studied by UV/Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy in solution and in POPC vesicles, where the light&#8208;induced changes in fluidity and hence, activity of anion transporters, are monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Dynamic light&#8208;scattering (DLS) and cryo&#8208;EM studies show that vesicle integrity is not impaired by photoswitching. Our work introduces a versatile approach to control solute transport by carrier molecules. Moreover, the photocontrol over membrane fluidity and, with that, mobility could eventually be used for directed motion, which we expect to be key in achieving active transport in the future.

         <title>A Hydrolytically Stable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous Desulfurization and Dehydration of Wet Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrolytically stable MOF has been reported for capturing SO2 from wet flue gas. Strikingly, the SO2 capture efficiency of the material is barely influenced by humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that its delicate pore structure featuring diverse pore dimensions and chemistry enables the segregation of trace SO2 and a large amount of water into different domains, paving the way for simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great prospects as adsorbents for industrial gas purification, but often suffer from issues of water stability and competitive water adsorption. Herein, we present a hydrolytically stable MOF that could selectively capture and recover trace SO2 from flue gas, and exhibits remarkable recyclability in the breakthrough experiments under wet flue&#8208;gas conditions, due to its excellent resistance to the corrosion of SO2 and the water&#8208;derived capillary forces. More strikingly, its SO2 capture efficiency is barely influenced by the increasing humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the delicate pore structure with diverse pore dimensions and chemistry leads to different adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics as well as segregated adsorption domains of SO2 and H2O. Significantly, this non&#8208;competitive adsorption mechanism enables simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent, opening an avenue toward cost&#8208;effective and simplified processing flowcharts for flue gas purification.

         <title>Highly Oriented and Ordered Co&#8208;Assembly Monolayers for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous distribution and ordered molecular orientation of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses. The novel graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with perfect hexagonal symmetry was successfully prepared to obtain low loss interface and high crystallization of perovskite film, which delivering an impressive high PCE of 26.10&#8201;% and enhanced operational stability.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells with inverted architecture have remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operating stability based on self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) hole transport layer. Homogeneous distribution and covalent binding mode of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses, which can be achieved through molecular design and co&#8208;assembly strategy. Here, we propose co&#8208;assembly strategy with SAM by employing a novel 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with phosphoric acid groups. Through the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between PAG and SAM, the enhanced tridentate anchoring and highly ordered molecular orientation perpendicular to the substrate are successfully achieved. The improvement of interfacial characteristics further optimizes the crystalline quality and buried interface properties of perovskite films, allowing us to achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.10&#8201;% under standard illumination.

         <title>Fluorination from Surface to Bulk Stabilizing High Nickel Cathode Materials with Outstanding Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through interfacial fluorination and introducing F ions to bulk phase as anchors, the high&#8208;voltage high&#8208;rate cycling performance of high nickel cathodes is boosted. The fluorinated surface induces the formation of a thin, dense CEI layer to facilitate Li+ migration and hinder electrolyte erosion. Additionally, the substitution of F for O in bulk phase forms strong TM&#8722;F bonds, thereby enhancing surface and internal structural stability, and hindering the formation of microcracks and gas evolution.







Abstract
High nickel layered oxides provide high energy densities as cathodes for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, critical issues such as capacity fading and voltage decay, which derive from labile surface reactivity and phase transition, especially under high&#8208;rate high&#8208;voltage conditions, prevent their commercialization. Here we propose a fluorination strategy to simultaneously introduce F atoms into oxygen layer and create a F aggregated interface. Substitution F for O stabilizes the layered ionic framework as the F ions can anchor the internal transition metal ions through strong TM&#8722;F bonding interaction, alleviating anisotropic lattice strain accumulation and release during the cycle, and promoting the Li+ dynamics diffusion. Meanwhile, the fluorinated interface induces the formation of a thin and stable CEI, ameliorating the detrimental issues like oxygen vacancy formation, the HF attacks and metal dissolution. The resultant fluorinated cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 192.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C within the voltage range of 2.7&#8211;4.5&#8197;V. This fluorination strategy approach provides design concepts for the advanced cathodes that can meet the demands of high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;voltage applications in next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Remote On&#8208;Paper Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Based High&#8208;Safety and Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The far&#8208;surface on&#8208;paper electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is programmed for high&#8208;safety information encryption. Three strategies are proposed and ultimately combined to design a multilevel information encryption system that is protected not only by encoding but also by the unique ECL decoding. Protein modified nanospheres (DPSN/PEI/BSA) and secondary antibody are used as the chemical and biological inks to encode the message on the nitrocellulose (NC) membranes, which can be only decrypted by ECL imaging with the immune reaction key (DPSN/PEI/mAb) and ECL key [tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium and voltage].







Abstract
The escalating needs in information protection underscore the urgency of developing advanced encryption strategies. Herein we report a novel chemical approach that enables information encryption by on&#8208;paper electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Dendritic porous silica nanospheres modified with polyetherimide and bovine serum albumin were prepared as the chemical ink to write the secret message on a paper. Attaching the paper to an electrode, immersing it in a solution containing tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and then applying a suitable voltage, a remote &#8220;catalytic route&#8221; electrochemical reaction produces ECL that functions as the key to decrypt and visualize the message by imaging. In addition, proteins can be also used as the biological ink to write the secret message, which is then decrypted by a combined use of immunochemistry and ECL imaging as two keys. We believe the ECL&#8208;based strategy holds great promise in high&#8208;safety and multilevel information encryption, as it is protected not only by encoding, like conventional invisible inks, but also by the unique ECL decoding approach.

         <title>Molecular Conjugated&#8208;Polymer Electrode Enables Rapid Proton Conduction for Electrosynthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with copper catalyst is reported for selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The polyaniline in the electrode mediates proton transfer reactions involved in the process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility for molecular engineering of electrode supports to promote the selectivity and energy efficiency for NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrate (NO3&#8722;) using renewable energy holds promise as a supplementary alternative to the Haber&#8722;Bosch process for NH3 production. Most research focuses on tuning the catalytic activity of metal catalysts by modification of the catalyst structures. However, the electrode supports which could influence the catalytic activity have not been well&#8208;explored. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 still exhibit limited energy efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current density. Herein, we report a polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with Cu catalyst for selective and energy&#8208;efficient NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3. In the electrode, the polyaniline promotes protonation of the key intermediate formed during NO3&#8722; reduction at Cu, which circumvents the limitation of the Cu catalyst in the efficiency&#8208;limiting proton transfer step. The molecular electrode produces NH3 at a partial current density of 2.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an energy efficiency of 62&#8201;%, demonstrating much better electrochemical performance than common Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and indicating the great potential in molecular engineering of electrode supports for selective NO3&#8722; reduction.

         <title>Interface Engineering of MOF Nanosheets for Accelerated Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni) nanosheets with the merits of robust structures and efficient catalytic metal sites has been presented for separator modification in Li&#8208;S batteries. The ultrathin modification layer with the uniform pore channels and efficient catalytic species can achieve fast Li+ transportation, effective polysulfides interception, and rapid catalytic conversion of polysulfides.







Abstract
Modifying the separator is considered as an effective strategy for achieving high performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, most modification layers are excessively thick, with catalytic active sites primarily located within the material&#8242;s interior. This configuration severely impacts Li+ transport and the efficient catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a multifunctional separator that integrates ultrathin design, catalytic activity, and ion sieving capabilities. Herein, we successfully linked TCPP(Ni) as a secondary ligand with Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets to create an ultra&#8208;thin separator modification layer (Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)) with efficient ion sieving and catalytic properties. The resultant multifunctional separators provide robust ion sieving capabilities that promote rapid Li+ transport and intercept polysulfides shuttling. Therefore, The Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)@PP cell maintains 70.0&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 600&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 3&#8197;C, while achieving an impressive areal capacity of 4.55&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;2 even with high sulfur content of 80&#8197;wt% at 0.5&#8197;C. This work provides valuable insights for rational design of MOF interface engineering in high energy density Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced Ordered Carbonaceous Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method is proposed to induce phase separation of the assembled units and the evolution of micellar templates, enabling the successful construction of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced hierarchical superstructures in a single preparation step. These superstructures exhibit a unique surface architecture composed of discontinuous nanodots and demonstrate enhanced catalytic activity, showcasing excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries.







Abstract
Constructing hierarchical superstructures through one&#8208;step bottom&#8208;up synthesis poses significant challenges due to strong interactions between additives and micelles, which hinders the formation of heterogeneous configurations. Here, we propose a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method to weaken these interactions and manipulate the thermal instability of micellar templates. This approach successfully synthesizes hierarchical superstructures that combine a carbonaceous nanosheet substrate with polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced, highly ordered discontinuous nanodots in a single preparation step. The surface nanodots have a diameter of approximately 19&#8197;nm and are spaced about 32&#8197;nm apart. Besides, the nanodots with various arrangements can be generated by simply adjusting the amount of POM. Importantly, the superstructure features more exposed POM catalytic sites than conventional carbonaceous hybrids lacking surface architectures, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. This high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated approach offers new insights for designing hierarchical superstructures and functional materials with enhanced activities.

High&#8208;Performance Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Demonstrating exceptional stability and capacity retention at high current densities, COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86 offer promising advancements in electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.







Abstract
Organic polymers are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electrode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, achieving long cycling stability and capacity retention at high current densities remains a significant challenge due to weak structural stability and low conductivity. In this study, we report the synthesis of two novel polyimide covalent organic frameworks (PI&#8208;COFs), COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86, by combining truxenone&#8208;based triamine and linear acid anhydride through polymerization. These PI&#8208;COFs feature layers with pore channels embedded with 18 carbonyl groups, facilitating rapid lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and enhancing structural stability under high current densities. Compared to previously reported organic polymer materials, COF&#8208;JLU86 demonstrates the excellent performance at high current densities, with an impressive specific capacity of 1161.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and outstanding cycling stability, retaining 1289.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles and 401.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 10000 cycles. Additionally, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide mechanistic insights, revealing that the high concentration of carbonyl redox&#8208;active sites and the optimized electronic structure contribute to the excellent electrochemical performance. These results highlight the potential of PI&#8208;COFs as high&#8208;performance organic electrode materials for LIBs, offering a promising solution to the challenges of long&#8208;term stability and capacity retention at high current densities.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Fluorosurfactants for Droplet&#8208;Based in vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of ten non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment bonded to a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment of various hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal interfacial tensions. A perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water microdroplet formulation allowed for in vivo mechanical force measurements and increased sensitivity was observed, expanding the relevance of this microdroplet platform.







Abstract
Fluorocarbon oils are uniquely suited for many biomedical applications due to their inert, bioorthogonal properties. In order to interface fluorocarbon oils with biological systems, non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants are necessary. However, there is a paucity of non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants with low interfacial tension (IFT) to stabilize fluorocarbon phases in aqueous environments (such as oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions). We developed non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment covalently bonded to a flexible perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment that confer low IFTs between a fluorocarbon oil (HFE&#8208;7700) and water. The synthesis of a panel of surfactants spanning a molecular weight range of 0.64&#8211;66&#8197;kDa with various hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal IFTs, ranging from 1.4 to 17.8 mN m&#8722;1. The majority of these custom fluorosurfactants display poor solubility in water, allowing their co&#8208;introduction with fluorocarbon oils and minimal leaching. We applied the PEG5PFPE1 surfactant for mechanical force measurements in zebrafish, enabling exceptional sensitivity.

A perfluorocarbon-in-water microdroplet formulation allowed for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mechanical force measurements and increased sensitivity was observed, expanding the relevance of this microdroplet platform.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorocarbon oils are uniquely suited for many biomedical applications due to their inert, bioorthogonal properties. In order to interface fluorocarbon oils with biological systems, non-ionic fluorosurfactants are necessary. However, there is a paucity of non-ionic fluorosurfactants with low interfacial tension (IFT) to stabilize fluorocarbon phases in aqueous environments (such as oil-in-water emulsions). We developed non-ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment covalently bonded to a flexible perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment that confer low IFTs between a fluorocarbon oil (HFE-7700) and water. The synthesis of a panel of surfactants spanning a molecular weight range of 0.64&#8211;66&#8197;kDa with various hydrophilic-lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal IFTs, ranging from 1.4 to 17.8 mN m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The majority of these custom fluorosurfactants display poor solubility in water, allowing their co-introduction with fluorocarbon oils and minimal leaching. We applied the PEG&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;PFPE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; surfactant for mechanical force measurements in zebrafish, enabling exceptional sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Crystals based Fast Single Ion Conductor for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystal (ZMCs) based on succinonitrile were developed with ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels for ion conduction and single Zn2+ ion migration feature. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivities and high Zn2+ ion transference number of the solid electrolyte, the as&#8208;fabricated solid Zn battery exhibited high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability, wide temperature adaptability and fast charging ability.







Abstract
The solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have low ionic conductivity due to the sluggish dynamics of polymer segments. Thus, only short&#8208;range movement of cations is supported, leading to low ionic conductivity and Zn2+ transference (tZn2+). Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystals (ZMCs) have considerable potential for supporting long&#8208;distance Zn2+ transport; however, their efficiency in ZIBs has not been explored. The present study developed a ZMC consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and zinc bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Zn(TFSI)2), with a structural formula identified as Zn(TFSI)2SN3. The ZMC has ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels in the crystalline lattices for ion conduction, providing high ionic conductivities (6.02&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 3.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C) and a high tZn2+ (0.97). We demonstrated that a Zn&#8214;Zn symmetrical battery with ZMCs has long&#8208;term cycling stability (1200&#8197;h) and a dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping process, even at a high plating areal density of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;fabricated solid&#8208;state Zn battery exhibited excellent performance, including high discharge capacity (1.52&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;term cycling stability (83.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 70000&#8197;cycles (7&#8197;months)), wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;35 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) and fast charging ability. The ZMC differs from SPEs in its structure for transporting Zn2+ ions, significantly improving solid&#8208;state ZIBs while maintaining safety, durability, and sustainability.

         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs) have been developed by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. These chimeras enable targeted membrane protein degradation and drug delivery for cancer combination immunotherapy through multireceptor&#8208;mediated recognition and endocytosis, providing a versatile tool for personalized disease treatment.







Abstract
Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208; mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin&#8208;/caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin&#8208;loaded mNbTAC, named Doxo&#8208;mvNbsPPH, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8722;L1 and HER2 targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11&#8208;fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.

         <title>A Site&#8208;Specific Click Chemistry Approach to Di&#8208;Ubiquitylate H1 Variants Reveals Position&#8208;Dependent Stimulation of the DNA Repair Protein RNF168</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a click chemistry approach to di&#8208;ubiquitylate histone H1 at relevant DNA repair&#8208;associated positions (H1KxUb2) to probe its effect on the E3 ligase RNF168. We demonstrate that H1KxUb2 stimulate RNF168 activity in vitro depending on the Ub2N3 attachment site on H1. Moreover, we show that H1K17Ub2 can recruit RNF168 to chromatin in cells, underlining the hypothesis that poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 directs RNF168 to DNA damaged sites.







Abstract
Ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysines 13 and 15 by the E3 ligase RNF168 plays a key role in orchestrating DNA double&#8208;strand break (DSB) repair, which is often deregulated in cancer. RNF168 activity is triggered by DSB signaling cascades, reportedly through K63&#8208;linked poly&#8208;ubiquitylation of linker histone H1. However, direct experimental evidence of this mechanism has been elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods to specifically poly&#8208;ubiquitylate H1. Here, we developed a versatile click chemistry approach to covalently link multiple proteins in a site&#8208;specific, controlled, and stepwise manner. Applying this method, we synthesized H1 constructs bearing triazole&#8208;linked di&#8208;ubiquitin on four DNA repair&#8208;associated ubiquitylation hotspots (H1KxUb2, at K17, 46, 64 and 96). Integrated into nucleosome arrays, the H1KxUb2 variants stimulated H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168 in a position&#8208;dependent manner, with H1K17Ub2 showing the strongest RNF168 activation effect. Moreover, we show that di&#8208;ubiquitin binding is the driving force underlying RNF168 recruitment, introducing H1K17Ub2 into living U&#8208;2 OS cells. Together, our results support the hypothesis of poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 guiding RNF168 recruitment to DSB sites. Moreover, we demonstrate how the streamlined synthesis of H1KxUb2 variants enables mechanistic studies into RNF168 regulation, with potential implications for its inhibition in susceptible cancers.

         <title>The Acetylene Bridge in Intramolecular Singlet Fission: A Boon or A Nuisance?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

Acetylene bridges provide a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing to be both a boon and a nuisance.







Abstract
Various analogues of the alkylsilylacetylene group are frequently used as auxiliary groups to enhance the solubility and stability of the acene dimer core, widely used as platforms to investigate intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) mechanisms. However, while in the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers they are primarily auxiliary groups, these are essential fragments of the bridging units in 6,6&#8217;/5,5&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers, the two preferred choices for dimerization. The starkly different iSF dynamics observed in the two variants raise the question of what role the acetylene bridges play. Here, we systematically designed a set of (oligo&#8722;)para&#8208;phenylene bridged 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers with an additional acetylene fragment in the bridging unit to mimic the structure of 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers. Contrasting the results with previously reported analogous 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers reveals that the acetylene bridges contribute to significant conformational freedom. This effect provides a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing that this structural motif can be both a boon and a nuisance. Additionally, our analysis reveals that these bridges directly modify the electronic states, highlighting significant pitfalls of the standard chromophore&#8208;bridge&#8208;chromophore framework used to design and interpret photophysics of iSF materials.

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based biomarker discovery holds immense promise. We have identified an exciting new path forward by incorporating stringent validation criteria into the analysis of high&#8208;quality MS&#8208;based discovery data. This approach facilitates a more straightforward and robust selection of peptide analytes suitable for translation into biomarkers. We applied our methods to plasma samples obtained from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort (n=492).







Abstract
Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.

         <title>Luminescence Modulation in Boron&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Based Luminogens via Boron Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils, for the first time, how the boron isotope effects shape the photophysical properties of boron cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In comparison to 10B, 11B enables to enhance luminous efficiency (the heavier, the brighter), reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (the heavier, the narrower), and extend luminescence lifetime (the heavier, the longer).







Abstract
Recent advances in luminescent materials highlight the significant impact of hydrogen isotope effects on improving optoelectronic properties. However, the research on the influence of the boron isotope effects on photophysical properties remains underdeveloped. This study focused on exploring the boron isotope effects in boron&#8208;cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In doing so, we designed and synthesized carborane&#8208;based luminogens containing 98&#8201;% 10B and 95&#8201;% 11B, respectively, and observed distinct photophysical behaviors. Compared to the 10B&#8208;enriched luminogens, the 11B&#8208;enriched counterparts can significantly enhance luminescence efficiency, prolong emission lifetime, and reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum. Additionally, increased thermal stability, redshifted B&#8722;H vibrations, and a fourfold enhanced electrochemiluminescence intensity have also been observed. On the other hand, the biological assessments of a 10B&#8208;enriched luminogen reveals low cytotoxicity, high boron uptake, and excellent fluorescence imaging capability, indicating the potential application in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This work presents the first comprehensive exploration on the boron isotope effects in boron clusters, and provides valuable insights into the rational design of organic luminogens for advanced optoelectronic and biomedical applications.

         <title>High Efficiency Alkaline Iodine Batteries with Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Enabled by Bi/Bi2O3 Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte, the IO3&#8722; formation kinetics could be significantly enhanced due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction between I2 and OH&#8722; ions. The sluggish kinetics of IO3&#8722; reduction can be improved by introducing Bi/Bi2O3 as a redox mediator (RM). Benefiting from reduced voltage polarization and improved reaction kinetics, the alkaline iodine full battery with I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; conversion on Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode delivers a higher areal capacity and a better cycle performance.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; redox couple is attractive for high energy aqueous batteries. Shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte significantly enhances the IO3&#8722; formation kinetics due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction, while the alkaline environment also offers more favorable Zn anode compatibility. However, sluggish kinetics during the reduction of IO3&#8722; persists in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, compromising the energy efficiency of this glorious redox couple. Here, we establish the fundamental redox mechanism of the I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; couple in alkaline electrolytes for the first time and propose that Bi/Bi2O3 acts as a redox mediator (RM) to &#8220;catalyze&#8221; the reduction of IO3&#8722;. This mediation significantly reduces the voltage gap between charge/discharge from 1.6&#8197;V to 1&#8197;V with improved conversion efficiency and rate capability. By pairing the Zn anode and the Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode, the full battery with I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; redox mechanism achieves high areal capacity of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation at 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 400 cycles.

Beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to the neighboring sites, the surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni across the Ni3C&#8722;Ni interface was revealed. This was induced by the discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments on the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions, leading to accelerated alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics.







Abstract
Constructing bifunctional sites through heterojunction engineering to accelerate water formation has become a pivotal strategy to improve the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, which is mainly focused on the synergistic effect of neighboring sites and the energetics of the surface reaction steps. However, the roles of the surface migration of key intermediates that go beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to neighboring atoms have usually been ignored. Using the heterostructured Ni3C&#8722;Ni catalyst as a model, we found that the rapid surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni component played a decisive role in facilitating water formation. Such unprecedented surface migration of OHad is induced by the large discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments of the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions. Benefiting from this, the resultant Ni3C&#8722;Ni exhibited outstanding mass activity for the alkaline HOR, which was approximately 19&#8208;fold and 21&#8208;fold higher than those of Ni and Ni3C, respectively. These findings not only provide novel insights into the alkaline HOR mechanism of heterostructured catalysts but also open new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.

         <title>Spatially Controlled DNA Frameworks for Sensitive Detection and Specific Isolation of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the programmability and rigid features of the DNA framework, the DNA triangular prisms are connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP) to achieve high affinity, signal intensity for sensitive detection of tumor cells. The DNA nanostructures can be also served as bridges between target cells and magnetic beads, resulting efficient isolation in whole blood.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity, specific, and sensitive probes are crucial for the specific recognition and identification of tumor cells from complex matrices. Multivalent binding is a powerful strategy, but the irrational spatial distribution of the functional moieties may reduce the probe performance. Here, we constructed a Janus DNA triangular prism nanostructure (3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3) for sensitive detection and specific isolation of tumor cells. Benefiting from spatial features of the triangular prism, the fluorescence intensity induced by 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 was almost 4 times that of the monovalent structure. Moreover, the DNA triangular prisms were connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP), in which the fluorescence intensity and affinity were increased to 9&#8208;fold and 10&#8208;fold of 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3, respectively. Furthermore, 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 and Zy1&#8208;MTP were combined with magnetic beads, and the latter showed higher capture efficiency (&gt;90&#8201;%) in whole blood. This work provides a new strategy for the efficient capture of rare cells in complex biological samples.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Activatable Copper Nanoplatforms Synergize with the 5&#8208;Azacytidine Prodrug to Potentiate Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of the NIR&#8208;II photosensitizer H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE and the ROS&#8208;responsive copper ionophore DTC&#8208;BA enables targeted activation of cuproptosis in oral carcinoma. Upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation, DTC chelates Cu2+ from H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE to form Cu(DTC)2, which is reduced by endogenous FDX1 to produce Cu+ and promote cuproptosis. The addition of 5&#8208;Azacytidine further replenished cellular FDX1, sustaining cuproptosis and enhancing both tumor suppression and antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T&#8208;cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc&#8208;AzaC) and 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR&#8208;controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image&#8208;guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.

         <title>Heterogeneous Carbonylation of Alcohols on Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Distinct Mo&#8722;Ni Dual Sites Localized at Edge Sulfur Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and weak adsorption and activation of CH3OH and CO were realized on charge&#8208;density&#8208;distinct Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2, boosting the direct gas phase heterogeneous carbonylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Alcohols carbonylation is of great importance in industry but remains a challenge to abandon the usage of the halide additives and noble metals. Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl&#8208;containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield (STY) of 4.74 molacetyl/kgcat./h and a durable stability as long as 100&#8197;h on Ni@MoS2 catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2 exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH3OH to break its C&#8722;O bond and non&#8208;dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8722;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS2 catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n&#8208;propanol and n&#8208;butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.

         <title>An Efficient CRISPR/Cas Cooperative Shearing Platform for Clinical Diagnostics Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing system that is capable of the most sensitive unamplified electrochemical assay of nucleic acids up to date. Two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously target different sites of the sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas systems.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas&#8208;CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR&#8208;CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue&#8208;ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5&#8197;minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&#8722;20&#8197;M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays. The CRISPR&#8208;CS platform detects monkeypox, human papilloma virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with an accuracy up to 98.1&#8201;%, demonstrating the potential application of the efficient cooperative shearing.

         <title>Dynamic Adaptation of Active Site Driven by Dual&#8208;side Adsorption in Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction</title>

CO2 reduction reaction mechanisms (CO2RR) on (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts (SACs). The reaction can take on both sides of the metal active centers leading to many different reaction pathways. Each adsorbed intermediate could change the electronic structure of the active site and dynamically assemble into a new catalyst.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom iron embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) is among the most representative single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite the simplicity of the active site, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C remains controversial. Firstly, there is a long debate regarding the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the reactions. Secondly, recent computational and experimental studies are puzzled by the fact that the CO&#8208;poisoned Fe centers still remain highly active at high potentials. Thirdly, there are ongoing challenges in elucidating the high selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over CO2RR at high potentials. In this work, we introduce a novel CO2RR mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, which was inspired by the dynamic of active sites in biological systems. By employing grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory and kinetic Monte&#8208;Carlo, we found that the RDS is not fixed but changes with the applied potential. We demonstrated that our proposed dual&#8208;side mechanisms could clarify the reason behind the high catalytic activity of CO&#8208;poisoned metal centers, as well as the high selectivity of HER over CO2RR at high potential. This study provides a fundamental explanation for long&#8208;standing puzzles of an important catalyst and calls for the importance of considering the dynamic of active sites in reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Role of Oxophilic Cr4+ in Cr&#8722;Cu2O Nanosheet Arrays for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxophilic Cr4+ was introduced into Cu2O nanosheet arrays, featuring a paramount Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ structure to protect the Cu+ species and accelerate water dissociation for synergistically electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O)&#8208;based catalysts present a promising activity for the electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (eNO3RA), but the electrochemical instability of Cu+ species may lead to an unsatisfactory durability, hindering the exploration of the structure&#8208;performance relationship. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to stabilize Cu+ through the incorporation of Cr4+ into the Cu2O matrix to construct a Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ network structure. In situ and quasi&#8208;in&#8197;situ characterizations reveal that the Cu+ species are well maintained via the strong Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ interaction that inhibits the leaching of lattice oxygen. Importantly, in&#8197;situ generated Cr3+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ from Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ is identified as a dual&#8208;active site for eNO3RA, wherein the Cu+ sites are responsible for the activation of N&#8208;containing intermediates, while the assisting Cr3+ centers serve as the electron&#8208;proton mediators for rapid water dissociation. Theoretical investigations further demonstrated that the metastable state Cr3+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ favors the conversion from the endoergic hydrogenation of the key *ON intermediate to an exoergic reaction in an ONH pathway, and facilitates the subsequent NH3 desorption with a low energy barrier. The superior eNO3RA with a maximum 91.6&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency could also be coupled with anodic sulfion oxidation to achieve concurrent NH3 production and sulfur recovery with reduced energy input.

         <title>[19]Starphene: Combined In&#8208;Solution and On&#8208;Surface Synthesis Towards the Largest Starphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a star&#8208;shaped polyarene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches is described. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface chemistry. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Starphenes are structurally appealing three&#8208;fold symmetric polycyclic aromatic compounds with potential interesting applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This family of star&#8208;shaped polyarenes can be regarded as three acenes that are connected through a single benzene ring. In fact, just like acenes, unsubstituted large starphenes are poorly soluble and highly reactive molecules under ambient conditions making their synthesis difficult to achieve. Herein, we report two different synthetic strategies to obtain a starphene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining solution&#8208;phase and on&#8208;surface synthesis.

Insert text for Table of Contents here: Light irradiation of a Zr&#8208;based coordination compound provides a potent, excited state proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) donor that remains stable against hydrogen evolution.

Abstract
Reductive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) has important energetic implications in numerous synthetic and natural redox processes. The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H2 evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr&#8208;based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr&#8208;based molecular materials.

         <title>Hemilabile and Redox&#8208;Active Quinone Ligands Unlock sp3&#8208;Rich Couplings in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Carbosulfenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;active quinone ligand enables seamless oxidation state manipulation between Ni(I) and Ni(II) intermediates, which facilitates the migratory insertion step. Meanwhile, the L&#8208;type lone&#8208;pair coordination promotes oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center. These mechanistic discoveries enable the installation of alkylsulfenyl (&#8211;SAlkyl) groups in a series of 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component coupling approach toward structurally complex dialkylsulfides is described via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation of unactivated alkenes with organoboron nucleophiles and alkylsulfenamide (N&#8722;S) electrophiles. Efficient catalytic turnover is facilitated using a tailored N&#8722;S electrophile containing an N&#8208;methyl methanesulfonamide leaving group, allowing catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Regioselectivity is controlled by a collection of monodentate, weakly coordinating native directing groups, including sulfonamides, amides, sulfinamides, phosphoramides, and carbamates. Key to the development of this transformation is the identification of quinones as a family of hemilabile and redox&#8208;active ligands that tune the steric and electronic properties of the metal throughout the catalytic cycle. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that the duroquinone (DQ) ligand adopts different coordination modes in different stages of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation&#8208;binding as an &#951;6 capping ligand to stabilize the precatalyst/resting state and prevent catalyst decomposition, binding as an X&#8208;type redox&#8208;active durosemiquinone radical anion to promote alkene migratory insertion with a less distorted square planar Ni(II) center, and binding as an L&#8208;type ligand to promote N&#8722;S oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center.

         <title>Li2MoO4 Tailored Anion&#8208;enhanced Solvation Sheath Layer Promotes Solution&#8208;phase Mediated Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of strategies to inhibit the shuttle effect of redox mediator can effectively reduce the high overpotential and prolong the cycle stability of Li&#8208;O2 batteries. In this manuscript, Li2MoO4 was introduced to LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to modify the Li+ solvation structure and forms an anion&#8208;rich derived protective solid electrolyte interphase on Li anode. Additionally, the dispersed Li2MoO4 promotes the O2 conversion in solution phase and inhibits the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species via adsorption capabilities. This work opens new avenues for the sustainable development and practical application of such battery systems.







Abstract
The high overpotential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is primarily triggered by sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the reaction interfaces. A typical LiBr redox mediator (RM) catalyst can effectively reduce the battery's overpotential. However, it is prone to shuttling and corroding the Li anode, leading to RM loss and reduced energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduced Li2MoO4 into the LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to promote the solution&#8208;phase mediated LOBs. This addition tailors the anion&#8208;enhanced Li+ solvation sheath layer and forms a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the Li anode. The robust SEI effectively mitigates the corrosion of soluble Br3&#8722;/Br2 and attacks by highly reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the dispersed and high&#8208;density Li2MoO4 exhibits strong adsorption capabilities for O2/LiO2 and Br&#8208;related species during the discharge/charge process, thereby promoting the growth and decomposition of Li2O2 in the solution phase and inhibiting the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species in LOBs. Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2&#8201;%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Stable Single&#8208;Site Pd on CeO2 Catalyst for Selective Amination of Phenols to Aromatic Amines without External Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel/universal aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed for constructing high&#8208;loading single&#8208;site catalysts with excellent thermal durability. Single&#8208;site Pd1/CeO2 catalyst achieved excellent selectivity for important aromatic amines from amination of phenols without external hydrogen, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly gave phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The outstanding properties of the former were attributed to high&#8208;loading Pd1/CeO2 with abundant defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties.







Abstract
Developing a new route to produce aromatic amines as key chemicals from renewable phenols is a benign alternative to current fossil&#8208;based routes like nitroaromatic hydrogenation, but is challenging because of the high dissociation energy of the Ar&#8722;OH bond and difficulty in controlling side reactions. Herein, an aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed to prepare high&#8208;density single&#8208;site cationic Pd species immobilized on CeO2 (Pd1/CeO2) with excellent sintering resistance. The obtained Pd1/CeO2 catalysts achieved remarkable selectivity of important aromatic amines (yield up to 76.2&#8201;%) in the phenols amination with amines without external hydrogen sources, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly afforded phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The excellent catalytic properties of the Pd1/CeO2 are closely related to high&#8208;loading Pd single&#8208;site catalysts with abundant surface defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties. This report provides a sustainable route for producing aromatic amines from renewable feedstocks.

         <title>Monofluorinated Phosphate with Unique P&#8722;F Bond for Nonflammable and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel monofluorinated phosphate co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), is developed. Unlike traditional C&#8722;F bond fluorination strategies, the P&#8722;F bond can effectively reduce the charge density on the oxygen atom of the P=O bond and lower the LUMO level of DEFP, achieving a unique balance between safety and electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large&#8208;scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8722;F bond that allows a trade&#8208;off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8722;F bond in DEFP weakens ion&#8208;dipole interactions with Li+ ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame&#8208;retardant properties of the P&#8722;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realized the first radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins via stepwise radical process, which is different from previous examples of acyl radicals to olefins. Electrophilic activation with Tf2O was employed to overcome the challenge of excessively low reduction peak potential of amides and therefore the unprecedented iminium radicals were readily generated under our photoredox reaction conditions.







Abstract
Despite the preliminary success of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited&#8208;state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Bio Hybrids for Selective Photobiocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nano&#8208;bio hybrid, which integrates photosensitive semiconductor with nitrogen conversion enzyme, can regulate the pathway of nitrate conversion at the enzymatic level and switch the product from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3&#8201;% through efficient and selective photogenerated electron transfer at the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface nano&#8208;bio interface, paving an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system (SAPS) that combines enzymes or cellular organisms with light&#8208;absorbing semiconductors, has emerged as an attractive approach for nitrogen conversion, yet faces the challenge of reaction pathway regulation. Herein, we find that photoelectrons can transfer from the &#8722;C&#8801;N groups at the edge of cyano&#8208;rich carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN) to nitrate reductase (NarGH), while the direct electron transfer to nitrite reductase (cd1NiR) is inhibited due to the physiological distance limit of active sites (&gt;14&#8197;&#197;). By means of the directional electron transfer between g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN and extracted biological enzymes, the product of the denitrification reaction was switched from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3&#8201;%. The converted nitrite could be further utilized by anammox microbiota and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) microorganisms, doubling the efficiency of total nitrogen removal (96.5&#177;2.3&#8201;%) for biological nitrogen removal and ammonia generation (12.6&#8197;mg NH4+&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), respectively. Thus, our work paves an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate for ammonia fuel production by strategically regulating the electron transfer pathway across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Stable Electrochemical CO2 Capture using Redox&#8208;Active Heterocyclic Benzodithiophene Quinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 capture was achieved with over 90&#8201;% capacity utilization in a 100&#8208;hour cycle using a heterocyclic benzodithiophene quinone in a flow system containing 13&#8201;% CO2 and 3.5&#8201;% O2, demonstrating its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This process was investigated through a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidate the kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms underlying the carbon capture efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon capture offers a promising alternative to thermal amine technology, which serves as the traditional benchmark method for CO2 capture. Despite its technological maturity, the widespread deployment of thermal amine technologies is hindered by high energy consumption and sorbent degradation. In contrast, electrochemical methods, with their inherently isothermal operation, address these challenges, offering enhanced energy efficiency and robustness. Among emerging strategies, electrochemical carbon capture systems using redox&#8208;active materials such as quinones stand out for their potential to capture CO2. However, their practical application is currently limited by their low stability in the presence of oxygen. We demonstrate that benzodithiophene quinone (BDT&#8208;Q), a heterocyclic quinone, exhibits high stability in electrochemical carbon capture processes with oxygen&#8208;containing feed gas. Conducted in a cyclic flow system with a simulated flue gas mixture containing 13&#8201;% CO2 and 3.5&#8201;% O2 for over 100&#8197;hours, the process demonstrates high oxygen stability with an electron utilization of 0.83 without significant degradation, indicating a promising approach for real world applications. Our study explores the potential of new heterocyclic quinone compounds in the context of carbon capture technologies.

         <title>Anion Modulation: Enabling Highly Conductive Stable Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and decent interfacial compatibility. By combining high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.55&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and a high ionic conductivity (3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. The anion&#8208;modulated structure makes it compatible with both Li&#8208;metal anode and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathode. This work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through anion modulation.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising ionic conductors for developing high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, developing SPEs with both high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility remains a challenge. Here, we propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte (termed AMPE) for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Specifically, we design the AMPE by incorporating high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit. The high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density segments contribute to achieving a decent voltage tolerance of the polymer chains and ensure sufficient carrier ions. The anion receptor, represented by a boron&#8208;containing molecule, promotes the generation of free Li+ by dissociating anion&#8208;cation pairs. More importantly, the strong interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient B and the TFSI&#8722; in the matrix promotes the anion reduction to form a stable anion&#8208;derived mosaic&#8208;like solid electrolyte interphase on the Li&#8208;metal anode. As a result, the AMPE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and effectively suppresses lithium dendrites, enabling an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li|AMPE|LiCoO2 cell to achieve a cycle life of 700&#8197;cycles at an operating voltage of 4.40&#8197;V. This design concept would inspire efforts to develop high&#8208;performance SPEs for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Organic Cationic&#8208;Coordinated Perfluoropolymer Electrolytes with Strong Li+&#8208;Solvent Interaction for Solid State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed unique copolymerized perfluoropolymer electrolytes to enlarge the molecular distance through the ionic dipole interactions between the perfluoropolymer chains and solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt, which strongly facilitate the transport of Li+, achieving solid&#8208;state batteries with superior performance.







Abstract
The practical application of solid&#8208;state polymer lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is plagued by the inferior ionic conductivity of the applied polymer electrolytes (PEs), which is caused by the coupling of ion transport with the motion of polymer segments. Here, solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt with strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction are inserted into an elaborately engineered perfluoropolymer electrolyte via ionic dipole interaction, extensively facilitating Li+ transport and improving mechanical properties. The intensified formation of solvation structures of contact ion pairs and ionic aggregates, as well as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawal properties of the F atoms in perfluoropolymers, give the PE high electrochemical stability and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells demonstrate a lifetime of 2500&#8197;h and an exceptionally high critical current density above 2.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Li||LiFePO4 batteries exhibit consistent cycling for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;C, and Li||uncoated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells achieve 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.45&#8201;%, one of the best results reported to date based on PEs. Our discovery sheds fresh light on the targeted synergistic regulation of the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of PEs to extend the cycle life of LMBs.

         <title>Outstanding Circularly Polarized TADF in Chiral Cu(I) Emitters: From Design to Application in CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Cu(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2) have been developed. Based on these emitters, efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 were fabricated. It was also discovered that a magnetic field significantly suppresses the CP&#8208;TADF of chiral Cu(I) emitters.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high&#8208;tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 bearing a (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;derived 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP&#8208;TADF with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal&#8208;quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77&#8197;K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs displaying mirror&#8208;imaged CPL bands with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and the maximum EQE of 6.15&#8201;%. Equally important, using the (+)&#8208;[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP&#8208;TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust CP&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) was introduced as an organic anode for proton batteries. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, fast and efficient Grotthuss proton conduction is enabled in the solid&#8208;state with low activation energy (192.7&#8197;meV). When coupling with tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCBQ) cathode, the all&#8208;organic proton battery achieves long stability over 3500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their applications are limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and lower the redox potentials of quinone materials. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7&#8197;meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500&#8197;cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperature.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Calix[4]arenes with Both Inherent and Axial Chirality via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes through enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation is reported. A broad range of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes with noteworthy optical properties (&#934;F up to 0.94) have been constructed in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (72 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
Inherently chiral calixarenes have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties, yet the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis methods remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes featuring inherent or both inherent and axial chirality via a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation strategy in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Electrooxidation was also suitable for this transformation to obviate the sacrificial metal oxidants, underscoring the environmentally friendly potential of this approach. A key octahedral cobaltacycle intermediate was synthesized and characterized, providing valuable insights into the mode of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol of this protocol. Noteworthy photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.94 were measured, underscoring the potential of these compounds in the domain of organic fluorescent materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Radicals with Emission Peaks over 750&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radical emitters with record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum efficiency among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm. The donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the designed radical emitter to exhibit charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding character. Both the high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;frequency vibrations coupling in D1 are effectively reduced, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative decay rate. As a result, the &#8220;energy gap law&#8221; is violated and exceptional luminescence efficiency is achieved.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission possess considerable potential for applications in both biological and optoelectronic technological domains, owing to their inherent advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and facile chemical modifiability. However, the repertoire of such molecules with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm and concurrently demonstrating high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) remains relatively scarce due to the energy gap law. Herein, we report two open&#8208;shell NIR radical emitters, denoted as DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM and DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM, achieved through the strategic integration of a donor group (DMNA) onto the Cz&#8208;BTM and PyID&#8208;BTM frameworks, respectively. We found that the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the two designed radical emitters to exhibit a charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding characteristics. Thus, the high&#8208;frequency vibrations are effectively suppressed. Besides, the reduction of low&#8208;frequency vibrations is observed. Collectively, the non&#8208;radiative decay channel is significantly suppressed, leading to exceptional NIR PLQE values. Specifically, DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM manifests an emission peak at 758&#8197;nm alongside a PLQE of 55&#8201;%, whereas DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM exhibits an emission peak at 778&#8197;nm with a PLQE of 66&#8201;%. Notably, these represent the pinnacle of PLQE among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks surpassing 750&#8197;nm.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of One&#8208;Dimensional Blocking Layer to Mitigate Deficient Surface of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is proposed to mitigate the surface issue of perovskite single crystals by inserting one&#8208;dimensional perovskites. Benefiting from the suppressed ion migration, the solar cells based on Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 single crystal retain 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of operation, which is the best report at present. This strategy is also instructive for optimizing other single&#8208;crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) single crystals are promising for optoelectronic application, but their high surface trap density and associated ion migration hinders device performance and stability. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) perovskites are designed and proposed as blocking layer at the crystal/electrode interface to mitigate the surface issues. As a model system, the interface ion migration in Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (FA=formamidinium) single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is obviously suppressed, leading to increase of T90 lifetime from 260 to 1000&#8197;hours, five times better than previously reported results. Besides, the reduction of surface iodide ion vacancies inhibits nonradiative recombination, thus increasing the efficiency from 22.1&#8201;% to 23.8&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Since the deficient crystal surface is a universal and open issue, our strategy is instructive for optimizing diverse single&#8208;crystal perovskite devices.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism of Chiral Lanthanide Complexes in the Context of Richardson's Theory of Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report on the Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism of two pairs of ErIII and TmIII chiral complexes investigated through visible and near&#8208;infrared light absorption in a wide temperature (4&#8211;290&#8197;K) and magnetic field (0&#8211;5 T) range. The results are presented and discussed in the frame of the Richardson's theory of lanthanides optical activity originally developed to identify the most promising chiroptical transitions for lanthanide&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
Here we report on the Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD) detected through visible and near&#8208;infrared light absorption of two enantiomeric pairs of ErIII and TmIII chiral complexes featuring a propeller&#8208;like molecular structure. The magnetic properties show typical features of isolated paramagnetic ions associated with 4I15/2 and 3H6 ground state terms. MChD spectroscopy shows high gMChD dissymmetry factors of ca. 0.12 T&#8722;1 and 0.05 T&#8722;1 (T=4.0&#8197;K and B=1.0 T) for ErIII and TmIII, respectively, associated with the magnetic&#8208;dipole allowed 4I13/2 &#8592; 4I15/2 and 3H5 &#8592; 3H6 transitions. MChD signals of the two complexes were detected up to room temperature and under magnetic fields up to 5.0 T. For the first time, the MChD results are discussed in the context of the Richardson theory of lanthanide optical activity and provide clear indications on the strongest MChD&#8208;active electronic transitions of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Exploring the Complex Chemistry and Degradation of Ascorbic Acid in Aqueous Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ascorbic acid (AA) under aqueous conditions undergoes degradation on a timescale relevant to nanoparticle synthesis, however, not to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) as commonly believed. This degree of degradation of AA has a pronounced effect not only on the final morphology but also the shape yield of the metal nanoparticles. This knowledge has been utilized in the synthesis of gold nanorods to achieve significantly enhanced shape yield.







Abstract
Ascorbic acid (AA) is the most widely used reductant for noble metal nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post&#8208;synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully&#8208;aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of Au nanorods. Our findings have important implications for achieving monodispersed products in the many metal NP synthesis reactions that make use of AA as a reducing agent.

         <dc:description>
The Cu/6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides in water is described. For bromides, reaction worked well with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C. For chlorides, hydroxylation proceeded at 100&#8201;&#176;C with 2&#8211;3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions.







Abstract
Hydroxylated (hetero)arenes are privileged motifs in natural products, materials, small&#8208;molecule pharmaceuticals and serve as versatile intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient Cu(I)/6&#8208;hydroxy picolinohydrazide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides (Br, Cl) in water. By establishing machine learning (ML) models, the design of ligands and optimization of reaction conditions were effectively accelerated. The N&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208; carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide (L32, 6&#8208;HPA&#8208;DMCA) demonstrated high efficiency for (hetero)aryl bromides, promoting hydroxylation reactions with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% (100&#8197;ppm) at 80&#8201;&#176;C to reach 10000 TON; for substrates containing sensitive functional groups, the catalyst loading needs to be increased to 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% under near&#8208;room temperature conditions. N&#8208;(2,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide (L42, 6&#8208;HPA&#8208;DTBCA) displayed superior reaction activity for chloride substrates, enabling hydroxylation reactions at 100&#8201;&#176;C with 2&#8211;3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Magnetic Effect in Rare Earth Intraparticle Heterostructured Nanoalloys for Boosting Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antiferromagnetic couplings between rare earth and 3d transition&#8208;metal were achieved by creating RhCo&#8722;RhGd intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs), which could regulate the spin polarization of active sites to optimize adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs demonstrated excellent alkaline HER catalytic activity, with a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and robust stability over 100&#8197;h operation.







Abstract
Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4&#8201;f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. Alloying RE with conventional 3d transition&#8208;metal (TM) is promising for the fabrication of advanced spin catalysts yet remains much difficulties in preparation, which leads to the mysteries of spin&#8208;magnetic effect between RE and 3d TM on catalysis. Here we define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d TM&#8208;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs) with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework, denoted as RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization. Theoretical calculations further reveal that active sites around the heterointerface with weakened spin polarization optimize the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus promoting alkaline hydrogen evolution catalysis. The RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs show a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as remarkable long&#8208;term stability, far superior to previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Hole Transport Uniformity for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Optimizing Buried Interface Contacts and Suppressing Interface Recombination</title>

P&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) was introduced between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite film. P&#8208;XPA made the HTL planar, promoted perovskite crystallization, and effectively passivated the bottom defects of the perovskite film. Ultimately, the device power conversion efficiency reached 25.87&#8201;% and the stability was significantly improved.







Abstract
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembly material has been recognized as a highly effective approach for mitigating nickel oxide (NiOx) surface&#8208;related challenges in inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, its uneven film generation and failure to effectively passivate the buried interface defects limit the device&#8216;s performance improvement potential. Herein, p&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) containing bilateral phosphate groups (&#8722;PO3H2) is introduced as an interface layer between the NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz and the perovskite layer. P&#8208;XPA can flatten the surface of hole transport layer and optimize interface contact. Meanwhile, p&#8208;XPA achieves better energy level alignment and promotes interfacial hole transport. In addition, the bilateral &#8722;PO3H2 of p&#8208;XPA can chelate with Pb2+ and form hydrogen bond with FA+ (formamidinium cation), thereby suppressing buried interface non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the IPSC with p&#8208;XPA buried interface modification achieves champion power conversion efficiency of 25.87&#8201;% (certified at 25.45&#8201;%) at laboratory scale (0.0448&#8197;cm2). The encapsulated target device exhibits better operational stability. Even after 1100&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C, its efficiency remains at an impressive 82.7&#8201;% of the initial efficiency. Molecules featuring bilateral passivation groups optimize interfacial contact and inhibit interfacial recombination, providing an effective approach to enhancing the stability and efficiency of devices.

         <title>Employing Singlet&#8208;Singlet Energy Transfer for Boosting the Reactivity of Type I Photoinitiators in Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

An exceptional photosensitization process of radical photopolymerization by singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer was found when using optical brighteners in a photopolymerizable resin containing phosphine oxide as photoinitiator.







Abstract
A remarkable and unexpected increase in the photopolymerization efficiency of an acrylic resin by a bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiator was observed when an optical brightener was present in the medium. High values for the maximal rates of photopolymerization were obtained by RT&#8208;FTIR at 365&#8197;nm under a very low irradiance of 1&#8197;mW/cm2. Fluorescence studies revealed that the quenching process occurs through singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer between the first singlet excited state of the optical brightener and the ground state photoinitiator. This mechanism acts as an additional pathway for the excitation of the photoinitiator, thereby increasing the total amount of initiating radicals. Using the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer model, we calculated the relative efficiency of the photosensitization process with respect to the direct excitation efficiency of the photoinitiator. The results demonstrate that the photosensitization process can be predicted, paving the way for further improvements in photoinitiating systems.

         <title>Engineering Robust Triazine Crosslinked and Pyridine Capped Anion Exchange Membrane for Advanced Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a robust triazine crosslinked and pyridine capped anion exchange membrane (AEM) for water electrolysis. The AEMWE with non&#8208;precious metal catalysts, achieved an outstanding current density of up to 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and could be operated ~430&#8197;h at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceeded the advanced AEMWEs.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEM) for water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) is significant for green hydrogen production. However, the current AEMWEs are restricted by the poor mechanical strength and low OH&#8722; conductivity of AEMs, leading to the low working stability and low current density. Here, we develop a robust AEM with polybiphenylpiperidium network by combining the crosslinking with triazine and the capping with pyridine for advanced AEMWEs. The AEM exhibits an excellent mechanical strength (79.4&#8197;MPa), low swelling ratio (19.2&#8201;%), persistent alkali stability (&#8776;5,000&#8197;hours) and high OH&#8722; conductivity (247.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) which achieves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AEMs. Importantly, when applied in AEMWEs, the corresponding electrolyzer equipped with commercial nickel iron and nickel molybdenum catalysts obtained a current density of up to 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and could be stably operated ~430&#8197;h at a high current density of 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceeds the most of AEMWEs. Our results suggest that triazine crosslinking and pyridine capping can effectively improve the overall performance of the AEMWEs.

         <title>Low&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Coordination Solvation Structure for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries via Electric Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric dipole&#8208;dipole interaction enables the interfacial richness of high&#8208;dipole FPy with low coordination towards Li+, extruding the coordinated solvent in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance. The low&#8208;solvent&#8208;coordination structure strengthens Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; coordination, facilitating TFSI&#8722; decomposition to generate a LiF&#8208;rich SEI film.







Abstract
Unveiling inherent interactions among solvents, Li+ ions, and anions are crucial in dictating solvation&#8208;desolvation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Developing an electrolyte with a low ion&#8208;transport barrier and minimal solvent coordination in its interfacial solvation structure is essential for forming an anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, a key component for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, we harness electric dipole&#8208;dipole synergistic interactions to formulate an electrolyte with significantly reduced interfacial solvent coordination. Operando characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that 2&#8208;fluoropyridine (FPy) with high dipole preferentially adsorbs onto the Li metal surface. The adsorbed FPy molecule squeezes succinonitrile in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance, leading to the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. Consequently, the introduction of FPy enhances the reversible capacity of the LiCoO2||Li cell, which maintains a capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at a 1&#8197;C rate. Moreover, the cycle life of LiCoO2 batteries with a limited supply of lithium extends from 120 cycles to over 200 cycles. These findings offer a strategy that can be applied broadly to design interfacial solvation structures for various metal&#8208;ion/metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>A Bandgap&#8208;Tuned Tetragonal Perovskite as Zero&#8208;Strain Anode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The key to solve the bottleneck problem for PIBs anode with alloying element is to provide sufficient buffer and restraint for the unavoidable volume expansion and stabilized structure. Our work innovatively presented a new route to chemically confine alloying element in a cubic framework to effectively provide stable structure. Demonstrated by in situ XRD and other characterizations, owing to the stabilized structure, the rationally designed anode yields stable electrochemical performance and zero&#8208;strain potassium storage.







Abstract
PIBs are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to high abundance of potassium resources and theoretical energy density, however, progress of PIBs is severely hindered by structural instability and poor cycling of anode material during continual insertion and extraction of larger&#8208;sized K+. Hence, developing anode material with structural stability and stable cycling remains a great challenge. Herein, band gap&#8208;tuned Mo&#8208;doped and carbon&#8208;coated lead titanate (CMPTO) with zero&#8208;strain K+ storage is presented as ultra&#8208;stable PIBs anode. Mo doping introduces narrowed band gap and optimized crystal lattice for enhanced intrinsic electron and ion transfer. Demonstrated by in situ XRD characterizations, the crystal structure stays stable with unchanged peak positions, fully revealing zero&#8208;strain characteristic of CMPTO anode during potassium storage for stable cyclic capability. Ultimately, CMPTO anode achieved ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of 7000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high capacity retention of 90&#8201;% and considerable specific capacity of 130.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1; with relatively large density, CMPTO realized eminent volumetric capacity of 1111.09&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 10000 cycles at 7041&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work introduces a promisingly new route into developing anode materials with ultra&#8208;stable performance for PIBs.

Programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;stop spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes, were utilized to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block organic heterostructures (OHs) with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi&#8208;block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.







Abstract
Organic heterostructures (OHs) with multi&#8208;segments exhibit special optoelectronic properties compared with monomeric structures. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures remains challenging due to compatibility issues between segment parts, which restricts their application in optical waveguides and integrated optics. Herein, we demonstrate programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;step spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures with a rational arrangement of three or more segments.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Coupling Strategy: Clamp Effect to Capture Mg2+ for Aqueous Magnesium Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work utilizes an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy to prepare a composite cathode material consisting of EDA and Mn2O3 with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms. Not only the outer layer of cloud&#8208;like EDA can effectively prevent the structural collapse of internal Mn2O3 during the charging and discharging process, but also can capture Mg2+ by its bidentate chelating ligand.







Abstract
The rapid transport kinetics of divalent magnesium ions are crucial for achieving distinguished performance in aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion battery&#8208;based energy storage capacitors. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Mg2+ with double charges and the host material significantly restricts Mg2+ diffusivity. In this study, a new composite material, EDA&#8208;Mn2O3, with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms comprising an organic phase (ethylenediamine, EDA) and an inorganic phase (manganese sesquioxide) was successfully synthesized via an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy. Inorganic&#8208;phase Mn2O3 serves as a scaffold structure, enabling the stable and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of magnesium ions. The organic phase EDA adsorbed onto the surface of Mn2O3 as an elastic matrix, works synergistically with Mn2O3, and utilizes bidentate chelating ligands to capture Mg2+. The robust coordination effect of terminal biprotonic amine in EDA enhances the structural diversity and specific capacity characteristics of the composite material, as further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ex situ XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. As expected, the EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 composite achieved an outstanding specific discharge capacity of 188.97&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g. Additionally, an aqueous magnesium ion capacitor with EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 serving as the cathode can reach 110.17&#8197;Wh/kg, which stands out among the aqueous magnesium ion capacitors that have been reported thus far. The abundant reversible redox sites are ensured by the strategic design concept based on the synergistic structure and composition advantages of organic and inorganic phases. This study aimed to explore the practical application value of organic&#8208;inorganic composite electrodes with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms.

         <title>Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by operando EQCM&#8208;D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding passivation layer formation, its morphology and dissolution is essential to systematically develop electrolytes which enable highly reversible Mg deposition. By applying operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, the impact of chloride and differences between more and less stable electrolytes are revealed, showing that highly efficient interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2)&#8208; and magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2)&#8208;based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl2, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8722;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)4]2&#8208;based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so&#8208;called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Transfer Protein CERT Using Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are many assays for monitoring enzymatic reactions. But how can the intracellular transport of lipids be analyzed efficiently? Here, an assay for the ceramide transfer protein CERT using nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) is presented. A combinatorial synthesis of analogs of a known inhibitor was used for validation and identified inhibitors with superior potency.







Abstract
A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red&#8208;labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell&#8208;based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility of the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA&#8208;12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid&#8208;phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA&#8208;12 in a subsequent dose&#8208;response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Molecule Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy through Bond&#8208;Selective Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The measurement of bond&#8208;selective fluorescence facilitates mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) spectral imaging of single dye molecules under ambient conditions. This technique allows researchers to distinguish between different molecular states (e.g., monomer or dimer) based on in situ monitoring of changes in vibrational properties.







Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy stands as a workhorse for exploring bond vibrations, offering a wealth of chemical insights across diverse frontiers. With increasing focus on the regime of single molecules, obtaining IR&#8208;sensitive information from individual molecules at room temperature would provide essential information about unknown molecular properties. Here, we leverage bond&#8208;selective fluorescence microscopy, facilitated by narrowband picosecond mid&#8208;IR and near&#8208;IR double&#8208;resonance excitation, for high&#8208;throughput mid&#8208;IR structural probing of single molecules. We robustly capture single&#8208;molecule images and analyze the combined polarization dependence, vibrational peaks, linewidths, and lifetimes of probe molecules with representative scaffolds. From bulk to single molecules, we find that vibrational lifetimes remain consistent, while linewidths are narrowed by approximately twofold and anisotropy becomes more pronounced. Additionally, unexpected peak shifts from single molecules were observed, attributed to the generation of new modes due to previously unexplored dimerization, supported by quantum chemistry calculations. These findings underscore the importance of infrared analysis on individual single molecules in ambient environments, offering molecular information crucial for functional imaging and the investigation of the fundamental properties and utilities of luminescent molecules.

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>

A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approach is used to grow naphthalenediimide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor MOF thin films for efficient free charge generation in response to light. Interestingly, we find that the optimum photocurrent response is obtained at a low optimal doping concentration of acceptor, which outperforms traditional donor&#8208;MOF thin films by a factor of forty.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3&#8201;%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Development of a FUT8 Inhibitor with Cellular Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core fucosylation, catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), is associated with various diseases, including cancer. Therefore, selective FUT8 inhibitors for in vivo or cell&#8208;based systems are highly sought&#8208;after. A FUT8&#8208;selective inhibitor, which was discovered by high&#8208;throughput screening and further structural optimization, successfully inhibits FUT8 in living cells, paving the way for the development of drugs targeting core fucosylation.







Abstract
Core fucosylation is catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), which fucosylates the innermost GlcNAc of N&#8208;glycans. Given the association of FUT8 with various diseases, including cancer, selective FUT8 inhibitors applicable to in vivo or cell&#8208;based systems are highly sought&#8208;after. Herein, we report the discovery of a compound that selectively inhibits FUT8 in cell&#8208;based assays. High&#8208;throughput screening revealed a FUT8&#8208;inhibiting pharmacophore, and further structural optimization yielded an inhibitor with a KD value of 49&#8197;nM. Notably, this binding occurs only in the presence of GDP (a product of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by FUT8). Mechanistic studies suggested that this inhibitor generates a highly reactive naphthoquinone methide derivative at the binding site in FUT8, which subsequently reacts with FUT8. Furthermore, prodrug derivatization of this inhibitor improved its stability, enabling suppression of core fucose expression and subsequent EGFR and T&#8208;cell signaling in cell&#8208;based assays, paving the way for the development of drugs targeting core fucosylation.

         <title>Oxytocin Analogues for the Oral Treatment of Abdominal Pain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Millions suffer from abdominal pain driven by gut disorders, with treatments ineffective and causing side effects. This work pioneered gut&#8208;stable peptides for oral administration targeting the oxytocin receptor on colonic nociceptors for abdominal pain suppression via a non&#8208;opioid&#8208;based gut&#8208;specific mechanism. This general concept of oral gut&#8208;specific/restricted peptide therapies provides new opportunities to combat gastrointestinal disorders.







Abstract
Abdominal pain presents an onerous reality for millions of people affected by gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The oxytocin receptor (OTR) has emerged as a new analgesic drug target with OTR expression upregulated on colon&#8208;innervating nociceptors in chronic visceral hypersensitivity states, accessible via luminal delivery. However, the low gastrointestinal stability of OTR's endogenous peptide ligand oxytocin (OT) is a bottleneck for therapeutic development. Here, we report the development of potent and fully gut&#8208;stable OT analogues, laying the foundation for a new area of oral gut&#8208;specific peptide therapeutics. Ligand optimisation guided by structure&#8208;gut&#8208;stability&#8208;activity relationships yielded highly stable analogues (t1/2&gt;24&#8197;h, compared to t1/2&lt;10&#8197;min of OT in intestinal fluid) equipotent to OT (~3&#8197;nM) and with enhanced OTR selectivity. Intra&#8208;colonic administration of the lead ligand significantly reduced colonic mechanical hypersensitivity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner in a mouse model of chronic abdominal pain. Moreover, oral administration of the lead ligand also displayed significant analgesia in this abdominal pain mouse model. The generated ligands and employed strategies could pave the way to a new class of oral gut&#8208;specific peptides to study and combat chronic gastrointestinal disorders, an area with substantial unmet medical needs.

         <title>A Covalent Triazine Framework for Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208;functionalization of alkenes is essential for synthesizing natural products, medicinally relevant compounds, and other important molecules. In this context, photocatalysis has emerged as a crucial tool for these reactions. However, existing methods rely on either expensive, or scarce metal photocatalysts, rendering this strategy less feasible for industrial applications. Herein, we disclose the first inexpensive porous heterogeneous material (oxidizing potential: +2.37&#8197;V vs SCE) designed to bridge the existing research gap. The careful selection of monomers to prepare the material enables us to achieve hydrocarboxylation, hydroamination, and hydroazidation across a wide range of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates.







Abstract
Porous materials&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic approach is further extended to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active molecules. Finally, detailed characterizations of the CTF and further mechanistic investigations provide mechanistic insights into these reactions.

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol Related to its Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP) is a popular solvent strongly enhancing reaction rates. Its unique properties are thought to be connected to its hydrogen&#8208;bond structure. Here we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and its non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, isopropanol, by means of infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. We show that the smaller size and faster dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP play an important role in its superior solvent properties.







Abstract
Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters: collective rearrangements are 3&#8197;times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can boost reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen&#8208;bonding.

     alt="Fast Collective Hydrogen-Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol Related to its Chemical Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexafluoro-isopropanol (HFIP) is a popular solvent strongly enhancing reaction rates. Its unique properties are thought to be connected to its hydrogen-bond structure. Here we investigate the hydrogen-bond dynamics of HFIP and its non-fluorinated counterpart, isopropanol, by means of infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. We show that the smaller size and faster dynamics of hydrogen-bonded clusters in HFIP play an important role in its superior solvent properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using fluorinated mono-alcohols, in particular hexafluoro-isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen-bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen-bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that of its non-fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen-bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen-bonded clusters: collective rearrangements are 3&#8197;times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen-bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can boost reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH-groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen-bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen-bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen-bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant-solvent hydrogen-bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Fatal Mushroom Neurotoxin Muscarine is Released from a Harmless Phosphorylated Precursor upon Cellular Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine is one of the most toxic mushroom metabolites. We identified its congener 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine in the fool's funnel and in various fiber cap mushrooms, and chemically and pharmacologically characterized this new natural product. As hydrolysis of its ester releases muscarine, our results help estimate the true toxin content of these mushrooms.







Abstract
l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine (1)&#8208;producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the 1&#8208;producing fool's funnel mushroom Clitocybe rivulosa, we identified 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine (2) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms Pseudosperma spectrale and Inocybe nitidiuscula. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 indicate only weak affinity of 2 to this target. Furthermore, we present biological evidence that muscaridine (3), a quaternary amine congener related to and co&#8208;occurring with 1, does not activate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 on human embryonic kidney cells. Our work provides important insight into the metabolic profile and the pharmacology of some of the most poisonous mushrooms. As the harmless 2 can liberate the potentially fatal 1 by unspecific enzymatic ester cleavage, these results are highly relevant for emergency medicine to estimate the true toxicity of these mushrooms.

On&#8208;surface synthesis of high&#8208;spin S=2 and S=3 nanographenes achieved through covalent linking of triangulenes via 1,3&#8208; and 1,3,5&#8208;phenylene spacers is reported. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, magnetic evidence of their degenerate ground states and an effective ferromagnetic inter&#8208;triangulene exchange is established. A spin model using a single coupling parameter describes magnetic excitations in both, the S=2 and S=3 nanographenes.

Cupric&#8208;(di)amine complexes, such as those made using n&#8208;butylamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine or its enantiomer, constitute versatile and complementary reagents for promoting the diverse regio&#8208; and atroposelective intramolecular dehydrogenative couplings of galloyl groups in chemical syntheses of glucopyranosic ellagitannins, such as tellimagrandin I and pedunculagin, and C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins, according to routes mimicking their postulated biosynthesis.







Abstract
Total syntheses of the C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins (&#8722;)&#8208;punicacortein A, (&#8722;)&#8208;epipunicacortein A and (+)&#8208;castalin were accomplished for the first time, and those of the glucopyranosic ellagitannins (+)&#8208;tellimagrandin I and (+)&#8208;pedunculagin were revisited. The atroposelective construction of their characteristic hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) and nonahydroxyterphenoyl (NHTP) units relied on the use of different cupric&#8208;amine complexes under different reaction conditions to mediate the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of galloyl groups at different positions of glucose cores. In particular, the monodentate n&#8208;butylamine and the bidentate (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine were found to be complementary in their capacity to promote the regio&#8208; and atroposelective coupling of galloyl groups on a 4C1&#8208;glucopyranosic core into 2,3&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208; and/or 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HHDP units. Furthermore, replacing (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine by its optical antipode not only counteracted the substrate&#8208;controlled induction of atroposelectivity to forge a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP unit, but it also enabled a 4C1 to 1C4 ring flip of the glucopyranosic core and hence the formation of 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208; and 3,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP units, such as those featured in the glucopyranosic ellagitannins phyllanemblinin B and geraniin.

         <title>Regiodivergent Functionalization of Protected and Unprotected Carbohydrates using Photoactive 4&#8208;Tetrafluoropyridinylthio Fragment as an Adaptive Activating Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general platform has been developed for the regiodivergent functionalization of both protected and unprotected carbohydrates by utilizing the electron&#8208;deficient thiyl fragment as a versatile and adaptive activating group. This method facilitates the efficient generation of carbon radicals at different saccharide sites, providing a valuable tool for the expeditous synthesis of a diverse array of high&#8208;value C&#8208;glycosides and rare sugars.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of carbohydrates holds a central position in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, driving the ongoing quest for ideal approaches to manipulate these compounds. In this study, we introduce a general strategy that enables the regiodivergent functionalization of saccharides. The use of electron&#8208;deficient photoactive 4&#8208;tetrafluoropyridinylthio (SPyf) fragment as an adaptable activating group, facilitated efficient functionalization across all saccharide sites. More importantly, this activating group can be directly installed at the C1, C5 and C6 positions of biomass&#8208;derived carbohydrates in a single step and in a site&#8208;selective manner, allowing for the efficient and precision&#8208;oriented modification of unprotected saccharides and glycans.

&lt;p&gt;A general platform has been developed for the regiodivergent functionalization of both protected and unprotected carbohydrates by utilizing the electron-deficient thiyl fragment as a versatile and adaptive activating group. This method facilitates the efficient generation of carbon radicals at different saccharide sites, providing a valuable tool for the expeditous synthesis of a diverse array of high-value &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides and rare sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Durable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two multifunctional additives of AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPMA and AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPEA are developed to suppress the voltage loss of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells of 1.78&#8197;eV and construct highly efficient and durable inverted inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. The formation of AQS&#8208;involved intermediate phase regulate the crystalliztaion rate resulting in lower defects of inorganic perovskites. Moreover, the benchmark of T90 lifetime of perovskite/organic tandem solar cells under MPPT can be promoted to 1000&#8197;h, which will facilitate the real&#8208;world deployment.







Abstract
Inverted perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/O TSCs) suffer from poor long&#8208;term device stability due to halide segregation in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskites, which hinders their practical deployment. Therefore, developing all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites for incorporation into P/O TSCs is a promising strategy because of their superior stability under continuous illumination. However, these inorganic WBG perovskites also face some critical issues, including rapid crystallization, phase instability, and large energy loss, etc. To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox&#8208;shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record Voc approaching 1.3&#8197;V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59&#8201;% could be achieved in a 1.78&#8197;eV band gap single&#8208;junction inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a T90 lifetime of 1000&#8197;h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.

         <title>Customized Heteronuclear Dual Single&#8208;Atom and Cluster Assemblies via D&#8208;Band Orchestration for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proactive cluster lockdown strategy is employed for the targeted synthesis of multicomponent ensemble catalysts featuring dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom and atomic cluster configurations for oxygen reduction reaction. The evolved configurations orchestrate hybridization between dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbitals near the Fermi level, optimizing antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and foster efficient OOH* generation, ultimately boosting catalytic activity.







Abstract
Advanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, integrating with well&#8208;dispersed single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) sites, showcase potential in bolstering catalytic activity. However, the precise structural modulation and in&#8208;depth investigation of their catalytic mechanisms pose ongoing challenges. Herein, a proactive cluster lockdown strategy is introduced, relying on the confinement of trinuclear clusters with metal atom exchange in the covalent organic polymers, enabling the targeted synthesis of a series of multicomponent ensembles featuring FeCo (Fe or Co) dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom (DSA) and atomic cluster (AC) configurations (FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC) via thermal pyrolysis. The designed FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC surpasses Fe&#8208; and Co&#8208;derived counterparts by 18&#8197;mV and 49&#8197;mV in ORR half&#8208;wave potential, whilst exhibiting exemplary performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries. Comprehensive analysis and theoretical simulation elucidate the enhanced activity stems from adeptly orchestrating dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbital hybridization proximate to the Fermi level, fine&#8208;tuning the antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and OOH* formation, thereby augmenting catalytic activity. This work elucidates the synergistic potentiation of active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts, pioneering innovative targeted design strategies for single&#8208;atom&#8208;cluster electrocatalysts.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Assisted Ligand Exchange Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency AgBiS2 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) plays a critical role in CQD solar cells. Here, a solvent engineering strategy is proposed to optimize the solid&#8208;state ligand exchange process. This strategy enables improved AgBiS2 CQD films, leading to solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% higher than that of the control one, as well as enhanced stability.







Abstract
As the initial synthesized colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are generally capped with insulating ligands, ligand exchange strategies are essential in the fabrication of CQD films for solar cells, which can regulate the surface chemical states of CQDs to make them more suitable for thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices. However, uncontrollable surface adsorption of water molecules during the ligand exchange process introduces new defect sites, thereby impairing the resultant device performance, which attracts more efforts devoted to it but remains a puzzle. Here, we develop a solvent&#8208;engineering&#8208;assisted ligand exchange strategy to revamp the surface adsorption, improve the exchange efficiency, and modulate the surface chemistry for the environmentally friendly lead&#8208;free silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) CQDs. The optimized AgBiS2 CQD solar cells deliver an outstanding champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 8.95&#8201;% and improved long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is less environment&#8208;dependent and can produce solar cells with negligible performance variance for several batches across several months. Our work demonstrates the critical role of solvents for ligand exchange in the surface chemistry of CQDs and the realization of high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices in a highly reproducible manner.

         <title>The Dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2)</title>

The green crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with Na on NaCl were shown to contain the free dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 that forms alongside the previously characterized yellow crystals of the alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The interplay between :AlAriPr8 and AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 in solution was examined in detail with small molecule activation studies and computational methods.







Abstract
Careful analysis of the crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with sodium on sodium chloride showed them to contain the long sought&#8208;after dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 (1) that forms alongside the previously characterized alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 1 revealed a nearly planar, trans&#8208;bent C(ipso)AlAlC(ipso) core with an Al&#8722;Al distance of 2.648(2)&#8197;&#197;. The molecular and electronic structure of 1 are consistent with an Al&#8722;Al double dative interaction augmented with diradical character and stabilized by dispersion interactions. Density functional theory calculations showed that the reactivity of :AlAriPr8 with dihydrogen involves 1, not :AlAriPr8, as the reactive species. In contrast, the reaction of :AlAriPr8 with ethylene gave two products, the 1,4&#8208;dialuminacyclohexane AriPr8Al(C2H4)2AlAriPr8 (2) and the aluminacyclopentane AriPr8Al(C4H8) (3), that can both form from the aluminacyclopropane intermediate AriPr8Al(C2H4). Although the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1 with two equivalents of ethylene was also calculated to be exergonic, it is likely to be kinetically blocked by the numerous isopropyl substituents surrounding the Al&#8722;Al bond. Attempts to fine&#8208;tune the steric bulk of the terphenyl ligand to allow stronger Al&#8722;Al bonding were unsuccessful, leading to the isolation of the sodium salt of a cyclotrialuminene, Na2[AlAriPr6]3 (4), instead of AriPr6AlAlAriPr6.

         <title>Dilute Pd&#8722;Ni Alloy through Low&#8208;temperature Pyrolysis for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloy HOR electrocatalyst has been developed from a Pd&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. This work offers new perspectives for designing more advanced electrocatalysts for energy conversion.







Abstract
Designing highly active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for advancing anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). While dilute metal alloys have demonstrated substantial potential in enhancing alkaline HOR performance, there has been limited exploration in terms of rational design, controllable synthesis, and mechanism study. Herein, we developed a series of dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloys, denoted as x% Pd&#8722;Ni, based on a trace&#8208;Pd decorated Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through a facile low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis approach. The x% Pd&#8722;Ni alloys exhibit efficient electrocatalytic activity for HOR in alkaline media. Notably, the optimal 0.5&#8201;% Pd&#8722;Ni catalyst demonstrates high intrinsic activity with an exchange current density of 0.055&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing that of many other alkaline HOR catalysts. The mechanism study reveals that the strong synergy between Pd single atoms (SAs)/Pd dimer and Ni substrate can modulate the binding strength of proton (H)/hydroxyl (OH), thereby significantly reducing the activation energy barrier of a decisive reaction step. This work offers new insights into designing advanced dilute metal or single&#8208;atom&#8208;alloys (SAAs) for alkaline HOR and potentially other energy conversion processes.

         <title>Interface Energy&#8208;Level Reorganization for Efficient Perovskite &#947;&#8208;Ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface molecular engineering of perovskites is used to adjust energy levels and block leakage currents from deficient contact barriers under high bias voltage. In this work, detectors treated with strong dipole ligands show enhanced energy resolution (3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays at room temperature) and remain stable under a continuous electric field for over 300&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for gamma&#8208;ray (&#947;&#8208;ray) spectrum detectors. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution energy spectra in single&#8208;photon pulse&#8208;height analysis mode remains challenging, due to the inevitable leakage currents degrade the recognizable fingerprint energies which is critical for resolving &#947;&#8208;ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate under high bias voltage, a deficient contact barrier can lead to excessive surface charge injection, thereby increasing leakage current from electrodes to perovskites. Hence, we conceive to employ surface ligand engineering on perovskite single crystals to manipulate energy levels to suppress leakage current. In particular, anchoring a strong dipole ligand onto the perovskite induced surface charge&#8208;density displacement, leading to a downward band bending and heightened the corresponding contact barrier. Consequently, the strategy minimized the detectors&#8217; leakage current by an order of magnitude, to as low as 44&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;100&#8197;V. The resulting detectors show a significant improvement in energy resolution, 3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays has been achieved at room temperature. The resulting detector further resolves each fingerprint energy for 152Eu &#947;&#8208;spectrum, representing one of the best &#947;&#8208;rays perovskite detectors reported to date. Moreover, the detectors exhibited stabilized energy resolution without any degradation under a continuous electric field (1,000&#8197;V&#8201;cm&#8722;1) for over 300&#8197;minutes, representing the longest longevity reported to date.

         <title>A Protocol for Unveiling the Nature of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reactions: True Water Splitting or Sacrificial Reagent Acceptorless Dehydrogenation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proton source for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents (SRs) is comprehensively investigated. Water is found to act as a proton shuttle as its amount remains constant during the course of the reaction. The results also demonstrate the importance of identifying the products of the often&#8208;complicated oxidation processes, as the potential value&#8208;added oxidation products might be even more interesting than the hydrogen produced.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution is a highly topical subject in academic research and a promising approach for sustainable fuel production from solar energy. Due to the mismatched energy diagram of the photosensitizer (especially semiconductor&#8208;based materials where band&#8208;edge engineering is not trivial) and the redox potential of the half&#8208;reactions of water splitting, photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting is usually accelerated by the addition of hole scavengers, i.e. sacrificial reagents such as alcohols, amines, and thiols. However, the source of the protons of the evolved H2 is often neglected, and it is questionable whether such systems are really water splitting. Here, we discuss recent reports on sacrificial reagent&#8208;assisted photocatalytic water splitting and present our recent findings, which showcase that the sacrificial reagent in the investigated photocatalytic water splitting systems inherently undergoes acceptorless dehydrogenation, with H2O serving as the proton shuttle, the amount of which doesn't change during the course of the reaction.

Highly efficient solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active sites is critical for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. In their Communication (e202412049), Dehui Deng, Liang Yu and co&#8208;workers report direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum STC and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity on a &#8220;Chainmail&#8221; catalyst by constructing a hierarchical nanocage architecture, achieving a near complete 98&#8201;% solar absorptivity and a remarkable potential decrease of over 240 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction.

Core fucosylation , catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), is implicated in various diseases, making FUT8 inhibitors highly desirable. In their Research Article (e202414682), Yoshiyuki Manabe, Koichi Fukase et&#8197;al. developed FUT8 inhibitors with potent cellular activity. Through high&#8208;throughput screening and structural optimization, potent FUT8 inhibitors were identified. Additionally, prodrug derivatization enhanced the stability of these inhibitors, enabling the suppression of core fucose expression in cell&#8208;based assays.

Chemical bonds in dye molecules are vibrationally excited by a narrowband mid&#8208;IR pulse and upconverted by a synchronized near&#8208;IR pulse. Doubly excited molecules emit fluorescence encoding mid&#8208;IR information. This bond&#8208;selective fluorescence&#8208;detected IR&#8208;excited (BonFIRE) method allows wide&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule mid&#8208;IR imaging and spectral profiling at room temperature, for robust characterization of polarization, peak position, linewidth, and vibrational relaxation, as reported by Lu Wei et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202413647).

Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. In their Research Article (e202412591), Chao Gu, Yaping Du et&#8197;al. define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d transition metal&#8211;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization.

         <title>Modifications of Prenyl Side Chains in Natural Product Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the unique modifications of prenyl side chains involved in natural product biosynthesis, including epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the enzymatic machinery responsible for the modifications of prenyl side chains and elucidating their roles in natural product biosynthesis. This interest stems from the pivotal role such modifications play in shaping the structural and functional diversity of natural products, as well as from their potential applications to synthetic biology and drug discovery. In addition to contributing to the diversity and complexity of natural products, unique modifications of prenyl side chains are represented by several novel biosynthetic mechanisms. Representative unique examples of epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization are summarized and discussed. By revealing the intriguing chemistry and enzymology behind these transformations, this comprehensive and comparative review will guide future efforts in the discovery, characterization and application of modifications of prenyl side chains in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes the development of heterobimetallic homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates including alkenes, alkynes, and ketones. These examples highlight the benefits of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, which can arise from the activation of molecular hydrogen across two different metal centers, bimetallic product elimination steps, and the tuning of electronic properties through metal&#8208;metal communication.







Abstract
Hydrogenations are fundamentally and industrially important reactions that are atom economical paths to synthesize value&#8208;added products from feedstock chemicals. The cooperative effects of two or more metal centers in multimetallic active sites is a successful strategy to activate small molecules and facilitate catalytic reactions, and this strategy has been recently applied to catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, heterobimetallic complexes have been well&#8208;documented to provide novel reaction pathways and improved selectivity, compared to their homo&#8208;bimetallic and monometallic analogues. This minireview provides a historical perspective on the development of heterobimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and describes recent developments in this burgeoning research area.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;induced Chiral Self&#8208;assembly for the In situ Construction, Modulation, Amplification and Applications of Asymmetric Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly offers a powerful method to in situ construct, modulate, amplify the asymmetric suprastructures. Further design of novel helical polymers requires exploring new PICSA systems, exploiting the multiple effects of asymmetric amplification discussed in Section&#8197;3, and designing appropriate building blocks to obtain stable binding strengths.







Abstract
In the polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA) process, chiral functional monomers undergo spontaneous supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and asymmetric stacking during living polymerization, leading to the in situ generation of chiroptical polymer assemblies characterized by diverse morphologies. The PICSA strategy facilitates precise control and manipulation of both non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helices and covalent macromolecular helices within aggregated cores, thereby driving significant advancements in fields such as chiral recognition materials, asymmetric catalysts, nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid crystals (LC). This minireview summarizes recent developments in the in situ chiroptical construction and modulation associated with the PICSA methodology. Furthermore, it seeks to elucidate emerging PICSA systems founded on various living polymerization mechanisms, exploring hierarchical chirality transfer processes and the pathway complexities in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. This minireview also presents several illustrative examples that demonstrate the practical applications of chiral polymer materials synthesized through the PICSA approach, thereby illuminating future opportunities in this innovative field.

         <title>Proton Relays in Molecular Catalysis for Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation: Lessons From the Mimicry of Hydrogenases and Electrochemical Kinetic Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the role of proton relays at the active sites of hydrogenases, highlighting their significance in hydrogen evolution and oxidation. It then explores biomimetic and bioinspired systems containing such proton relays from the literature, discusses the electrochemical framework for enhancing catalysis, and identifies key parameters for achieving bidirectional and reversible catalysis.







Abstract
The active sites of metalloenzymes involved in small molecules activation often contain pendant bases that act as proton relay promoting proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes. Here we focus on hydrogenases and on the reactions they catalyze, i.&#8201;e. the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. After a short description of these enzymes, we review some of the various biomimetic and bioinspired molecular systems that contain proton relays. We then provide the formal electrochemical framework required to decipher the key role of such proton relay to enhance catalysis in a single direction and discuss the few systems active for H2 evolution for which quantitative kinetic data are available. We finally highlight key parameters required to reach bidirectional catalysis (both hydrogen evolution and hydrogen oxidation catalyzed) and then transition to reversible catalysis (both reactions catalyzed in a narrow potential range) as well as illustrate these features on few systems from the literature.

         <title>Pairing Oxygen Reduction and Water Oxidation for Dual&#8208;Pathway H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a nexus chemical which has various industrial applications. Nevertheless, its current industrial process is carbon&#8208;intensive. Pairing two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) with two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) reaction is a green process for H2O2 synthesis. This review offers a perspective on catalysts integrating 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR reactions for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 synthesis driven by sunlight and electricity.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial chemical applied in various industry sectors. However, the current industrial anthraquinone process for H2O2 synthesis is carbon&#8208;intensive. With sunlight and renewable electricity as energy inputs, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis have great potential for green H2O2 production from oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Herein, we review the advances in pairing two&#8208;electron O2 reduction and two&#8208;electron H2O oxidation reactions for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 synthesis. The basic principles, paired redox reactions, and catalytic device configurations are introduced initially. Aligning with the energy input, the latest photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and photo&#8208;electrocatalysts for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 production are discussed afterward. Finally, we outlook the research opportunities in the future. This minireview aims to provide insights and guidelines for the broad community who are interested in catalyst design and innovative technology for on&#8208;site H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Unprecedented Silver&#8208;Based Hybrid Pyroelectric Enabling Wide Spectral Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity for Birefringence Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric that enables wide spectral light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity, serving as a new pathway to modulate birefringence with the highest level of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the future advance of smart optical and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystal, which has the capacity to manipulate polarization light, holds an indispensable position in optics and optoelectronics, while it remains challenging to fulfill the modulation of birefringence. Here, we present wide spectral photo&#8208;pyroelectric effect in a silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 (N&#8208;CHM=N&#8208;cyclohexylmethylamine), serving as a feasible strategy to regulate birefringence through light stimuli. As the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 exhibits strong room&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;pyroelectricity with a large polarization of ~3.23&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 and high voltage responsivity of ~0.96&#8197;m2/C across the UV&#8211;NIR spectral region. Strikingly, the photomodulation of its in&#8208;plane birefringence is established through pyroelectric effect, giving a saturation value of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2 that is among the highest level achieved to date. This study on the birefringence photomodulation of lead&#8208;free hybrid pyroelectric is anticipated to boost future development of new smart optical and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Light&#8208;Harvesting Solar Thermal Electrocatalyst Boosts Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum solar thermal conversion (STC) and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity is achieved by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle, delivering a near&#8208;complete 98&#8201;% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97&#8201;%, enabling a remarkable potential decrease of over 240&#8197;mV in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination.







Abstract
Enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active site is critical but challenging for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum STC and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle. This catalyst exhibits a near&#8208;complete 98&#8201;% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97&#8201;%, which is superior than previous solar thermal catalytic materials. It delivers a remarkable potential decrease of over 240&#8197;mV at various current densities for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination, which is practically unachievable via traditionally heating the system. The high&#8208;efficiency STC is enabled by a synergy between the regulated electronic structure of graphene via CoNi&#8208;carbon interaction and the multiple absorption of lights by the light&#8208;trapping nanocage. Theoretical calculations suggest that high temperature&#8208;induced vibrational free energy gain promotes the potential&#8208;limiting *O to *OOH step, which decreases the overpotential for oxygen evolution.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Metathesis Versus Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis of Terpenes, Taking the Path Less Travelled</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,6&#8208;Heptadiene substrates readily ring&#8208;close to form thermodynamically stable five&#8208;membered rings in the presence of metathesis catalysts. However, the unique selectivity displayed by Ru&#8722;SCF3&#8722;I provides a distinct cross&#8208;metathesis pathway with various prenylated 1,6&#8208;heptadienes, including terpenes. This new methodology presents a promising opportunity for the modification of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
A diiodo ruthenium olefin metathesis pre&#8208;catalyst was employed to achieve remarkably selective cross&#8208;metathesis reactions of prenylated 1,6&#8208;dienes, effectively overcoming the entropically favored intramolecular ring&#8208;closing metathesis. This reaction was investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations and fine&#8208;tuned through the application of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach. The potential of this innovative process was demonstrated through the unprecedented functionalization of various terpene natural products via cross&#8208;metathesis, resulting in the synthesis of new derivatives in a single step.

         <title>Why Mg2IrH6 Is Predicted to Be a High&#8208;Temperature Superconductor, But Ca2IrH6 Is Not</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Mg2IrH6, a predicted high temperature superconductor, the superconductivity results from the vibrations of the IrH64&#8722; molecules, whose eg* states are found near the Fermi level. In stark contrast, in Ca2IrH6 superconductivity is quenched via IrH64&#8722;&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation, as evidenced by a plot of the charge density of the occupied part of the metallic band, with contributions around Ca (yellow tetrahedra) and the molecular anion (blue octahedra).







Abstract
The X2MH6 family, consisting of an electropositive cation Xn+ and a main group metal M octahedrally coordinated by hydrogen, have been identified as promising templates for high&#8208;temperature conventional superconductivity. Herein, we analyze the electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg2IrH6 and Ca2IrH6, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties rivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within Mg2IrH6 the vibrations of the anions IrH64&#8722; anions are key for the superconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the

 set of orbitals, which are antibonding between the H 1s and the Ir 

dx2-y2

 ${d_{x^2 - y^2 } }$



 or

 orbitals. Because calcium possesses low&#8208;lying d&#8208;orbitals, 

eg*

 ${e_g^{\ast} }$



&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our analysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second or third row X metal atoms, and may provide rules for identifying likely high&#8208;temperature superconductors in other systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.

         <title>Catalytic Promiscuity of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase Enables Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Tetralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of fatty acid photodecarboxylase (CvFAP) was reported for the first time, providing an efficient approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones. The native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving FADox/FADsq redox pair and an ET/PT process of radical termination, which was distinct from previous reports.







Abstract
In the field of biocatalysis, discovering novel reactivity from known enzymes has been a longstanding challenge. Fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) has drawn considerable attention as a promising photoenzyme with potential green chemistry applications; however, its non&#8208;natural reactivity has rarely been exploited to date. Herein we report a non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of CvFAP inspired by its natural oxidative decarboxylation process, enabling the stereoselective synthesis of a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones with high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving oxidized state (FADox)/semiquinone state (FADsq) redox pair and an electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) process of radical termination, distinct from the previous reports. To our knowledge, this study represents a new example of CvFAP promiscuity, and thus expands the reactivity repertoire of CvFAP and highlights the versatility of CvFAP in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Construction of Functional Multi&#8208;Dimensional MXene&#8208;based Composites Directly from MAX Phases through Gas&#8208;Solid Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ construction of functional multi&#8208;dimensional MXene&#8208;based composites with versatile architectures is first realized directly from MAX phases through a general and efficient gas&#8208;solid reaction, for electrochemical applications, especially the durable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, thanks to appealing synergistic effects induced by the involved components.







Abstract
The weak bonding of A atoms with MX layers in MAX phases not only enables the selective etching of A layers for MXene preparation but brings about the chance to construct A derivatives/MXene composites via in situ conversion. Here, a facile and general gas&#8208;solid reaction systems are elegantly devised to construct multi&#8208;dimensional MXene based composites including AlF3 nanorods/MXene, AlF3 nanocrystals/MXene, amorphous AlF3/MXene, A filled carbon nanotubes/MXene, layered metal chalcogenides/MXene, MOF/MXene, and so on. The intrinsic effect mechanism of interlayer confinement towards crystal growth, catalytic behavior, van der Waals&#8208;heterostructure construction and coordination reaction are rationally put forward. The tight interface combination and synergistic effect from distinct components make them promising active materials for electrochemical applications. More particularly, the AlF3 nanorods/Nb2C MXene demonstrate bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity toward the conversion between Li2S and lithium polysulfides, which alleviates the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Selective Catalytic Combustion of Hydrogen under Aerobic Conditions on Na2WO4/SiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2WO4/SiO2, a formulation known to be active for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), catalyzes selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) in H2&#8208;hydrocarbon&#8208;O2 mixtures at 873&#8211;983&#8197;K, with H2 combustion kinetics dependent only on the hydrogen partial pressure. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrate that the Na2WO4 phase is disordered under reaction conditions, even at temperatures below the bulk Na2WO4 melting point.







Abstract
Na2WO4/SiO2, a material known to catalyze alkane selective oxidation including the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), is demonstrated to catalyze selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) with &gt;97&#8201;% selectivity in mixtures with several hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, C6H6) in the presence of gas&#8208;phase dioxygen at 883&#8211;983&#8197;K. Hydrogen combustion rates exhibit a near&#8208;first&#8208;order dependence on H2 partial pressure and are zero&#8208;order in H2O and O2 partial pressures. Mechanistic studies at 923&#8197;K using isotopically&#8208;labeled reagents demonstrate the kinetic relevance of H&#8722;H dissociation and absence of O&#8208;atom recombination. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and W LIII&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies demonstrate, respectively, a loss of Na2WO4 crystallinity and lack of second&#8208;shell coordination with respect to W6+ cations below 923&#8197;K; benchmark experiments show that alkali cations must be present for the material to be selective for hydrogen combustion, but that materials containing Na alone have much lower combustion rates (per gram Na) than those containing Na and W. These data suggest a synergy between Na and W in a disordered phase at temperatures below the bulk melting point of Na2WO4 (971&#8197;K) during SHC catalysis. The Na2WO4/SiO2 SHC catalyst maintains stable combustion rates at temperatures ca. 100&#8197;K higher than redox&#8208;active SHC catalysts and could potentially enable enhanced olefin yields in tandem operation of reactors combining alkane dehydrogenation with SHC processes.

         <title>An Organometallic Umpolung Approach for Iron&#8208;Mediated Propargylic C&#8722;H Etherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;mediated reaction couples alkynes and alcohols to give propargylic ethers. This three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol is applicable to complex, heteroatom&#8208;rich substrates to deliver propargylic ethers in a highly chemoselective manner.







Abstract
Propargylic ethers serve as useful intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of complex targets. However, propargylic substitution of prefunctionalized alkyne starting materials remains the dominant method for the synthesis of propargyl ethers, while direct etherification of simple alkynes via propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization remains largely underreported. Herein, we report an organometallic umpolung approach for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H propargylic etherification. A telescopic protocol for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H deprotonation followed by mild oxidative coupling with alcohols enabled the use of simple or functionalized alkynes for the expedient synthesis of propargylic ethers with excellent functional group compatibility, chemoselectivity and regioselectivity.

In this study, a dual&#8208;purpose ncAA that can undergo inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEEDA) reactions and coordinate luminogenic metal complexes was designed, synthesised, and incorporated into a protein. Significantly, luminescence studies revealed emission shifts upon dual functionalisation.







Abstract
A rationally designed dual&#8208;purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid (Trz) has been synthesised and successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold by genetic code expansion. Trz contains a 5&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine system, which allows for inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions to occur on the triazine ring and for metal ions to be chelated both before and after the click reaction. Trz was successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold and the IEDDA utility of Trz demonstrated through the site&#8208;specific labelling of the purified protein with a bicyclononyne. Additionally, Trz was shown to successfully coordinate a cyclometallated iridium(III) centre, providing access to a bioorthogonal luminogenic probe. The luminescent properties of the Ir(III)&#8208;bound protein blue&#8208;shift upon IEDDA click reaction with bicyclononyne, providing a unique method for monitoring the extent and location of the labelling reaction. In summary, Trz is a new dual&#8208;purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid with great potential for myriad bioapplications where metal&#8208;based functionality is required, for example in imaging, catalysis, and photo&#8208;dynamic therapy, in conjunction with a bioorthogonal reactive handle to impart additional functionalities, such as dual&#8208;modality imaging or therapeutic payloads.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Induced Division of Polymersomes for Biomimetic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes, synthetic vesicles mimicking cellular compartments, enable the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems such as microreactors and synthetic organelles. We report multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture formed through self&#8208;division, driven by the pH&#8208;triggered incorporation of a phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine tripeptide into the membrane. This process produces internal vesicles that colocalize enzymes, offering a method for engineering adaptive microreactors.







Abstract
Polymersomes are synthetic vesicles that mimic the architecture of cellular compartments such as the cell membrane and organelles. These biomimetic compartments facilitate the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems, including microreactors and synthetic organelles. However, the construction of hierarchical multi&#8208;compartment systems remains challenging and typically requires the encapsulation of pre&#8208;formed vesicles within a host compartment. Here, we report the formation of multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture achieved through self&#8208;division induced by short peptides incorporated into the vesicle membrane. A phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine (FFM) tripeptide was designed and encapsulated into the polymersome via microfluidics. We demonstrate that vesicle self&#8208;division occurs due to peptide incorporation into the membrane in response to pH&#8197;changes. This self&#8208;division creates internal vesicles capable of colocalizing enzymes. The hybrid polymer&#8208;peptide system described here provides a straightforward method for developing subcompartmentalized systems, paving the way for engineering microreactors with life&#8208;like properties.

         <title>Hydrazine&#8208;Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Of Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis is described. The polymerizations proceed with high stereoselectivity and show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, and low dispersity values.







Abstract
Materials formed by the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclic olefins are highly valued for industrial and academic applications but are difficult to prepare free of metal contaminants. Here we describe a highly efficient metal&#8208;free ROMP of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis. Reactions can be initiated via in situ condensation of a [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic hydrazine catalyst with an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde initiator. The polymerizations show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, low dispersity values, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Additionally, the hydrazine can be used in substoichiometric amounts relative to the aldehyde chain&#8208;end while maintaining good control over molecular weight and low dispersity values, indicating that a highly efficient chain transfer mechanism is occurring.

         <title>Carbon Nanoparticle Oxidation by NO2 and O2: Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a kinetic multilayer model and comprehensive experimental data, this study investigates the oxidation of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions, going beyond traditional shrinking core modelling approaches. The study develops a molecular picture of the reaction system, including a reference chemical reaction mechanisms and energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways.







Abstract
Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM&#8208;GAP&#8208;CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane&#8208;like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate&#8208;limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2 at lower temperatures and O2 at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from

         <title>Experimental and Computational Evidence of a Stable RNA G&#8208;Triplex Structure at Physiological Temperature in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quadruplex&#8208;forming RG1 sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome is shown to adopt a two&#8208;triads G&#8208;triplex structure at physiological temperature. The high thermodynamic stability of this RNA structure suggests that RNA G&#8208;triplexes could be biologically relevant and represent novel targets for antiviral therapies.







Abstract
RG1 is a quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome proposed as possible therapeutic target for COVID&#8208;19. We demonstrate that the dominant conformation of RG1 under physiological conditions differs from the parallel quadruplex previously assumed. Through comprehensive investigations employing CD, UV, NMR, DSC, gel electrophoresis, MD simulations, in silico spectroscopy and the use of truncated RG1 sequences, we have identified this stable conformation as an RNA G&#8208;triplex composed of two G&#8208;triads. We believe this previously unreported RNA structure could serve as a novel therapeutic target. Our findings open new avenues for further studies on the presence and biological role of RNA G&#8208;triplexes in vivo.

         <title>Structure Revision of Halisphingosine A via Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 32 stereoisomers of halisphingosine A in 11&#8211;13 steps with good overall yields. Comparative NMR studies resolved a longstanding structural misconception, leading to the revision of halisphingosine A. Our synthetic analytical study provides an unparalleled level of detail on the challenges associated with determining the structures of non&#8208;model sphingoid bases, and will catalyse future research in marine metabolomics and sphingolipid metabolism.







Abstract
Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late&#8208;stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine A core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aminooctadec&#8208;9&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3,8&#8208;triol, and to pursue further structure&#8211;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base&#8208;sensing receptors.

         <title>A Phosphotriester&#8208;Masked Dideoxy&#8208;cGAMP Derivative as a Cell&#8208;Permeable STING Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dideoxy analog of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) was prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. By masking the negative charges of the phosphate backbones, the cellular uptake of cGAMP was highly increased from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger in which guanosine and adenosine are connected by one 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; and one 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiester linkage. It is formed in the cytosol upon detection of pathogenic DNA by the enzyme guanosine&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). cGAMP subsequently binds to the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to elicit an innate immune response leading to the production of type&#8197;I interferons and cytokines. STING agonists are a highly promising avenue for an immuno&#8208;oncological anticancer therapy. A particular challenge with cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists are the two negative charges of the phosphodiester linkages, which strongly reduce the ability of such compounds to penetrate cell membranes. The development of cell&#8208;permeable STING agonists that can stimulate the immune system enhancing their anticancer potency is currently of utmost importance in the field. Herein, we report the development of a dideoxy derivative of cGAMP as a phosphotriester prodrug, where the negative charge of the phosphate backbone has been masked with a thioester. We found that this thioester&#8208;protected compound features a dramatic increase in its cellular potency that rises from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM. The new compound is envisioned to enable an efficient STING&#8208;agonist&#8208;based anticancer therapy.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) complexes with PNP pincer ligands have been isolated. They react with C&#8722;H bonds of unactivated substrates such as ethylene and benzene, leading to the oxidative C&#8722;H addition products. Depending on the size of the alkyl groups on the phosphorus atom, the reactivity towards C&#8722;H bonds can be fine&#8208;tuned.







Abstract
Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b, &#8220;framed&#8221; and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium complex 2&#8201;a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8722; Rh(I) complex 2&#8201;aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2&#8201;b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8722;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2&#8201;a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4&#8201;a) or C&#8722;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4&#8201;b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2&#8201;b was found to reversibly C&#8722;H activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
EMox&#8208;seq (enzymatic methylcytidine oxidation sequencing) enables bisulfite&#8208;free, single molecule sequencing of DNA methylation patterns at high precision with just a single enzymatic treatment step, using a high&#8208;performance Tet3 catalytic domain.







Abstract
In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.

         <title>Fluorinated Squareimines for Molecular Sieving of Aromatic over Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squareimines are a new class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure that facilitates interactions with the electron&#8208;deficient panels, enabling selective separation of aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic mixtures. By using dynamic covalent imine chemistry, crystalline material NDI2F42 is obtained in high yields, with this material demonstrating rapid adsorption and high selectivities for the sieving of aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The development of more energy&#8208;efficient separation technologies is essential.

         <title>Accelerated First&#8208;Principles Exploration of Structure and Reactivity in Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches to computational chemistry provide atomistic insight into graphene oxide. This work showcases how ML potentials can be fitted by combining accelerated first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics and graph neural&#8208;network models. Large&#8208;scale simulations, driven by the resulting potential, reveal how functional groups in a graphene oxide sheet evolve and graphitic domains form during thermal reduction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) materials are widely studied, and yet their atomic&#8208;scale structures remain to be fully understood. Here we show that the chemical and configurational space of GO can be rapidly explored by advanced machine&#8208;learning methods, combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly acceleration for first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics with message&#8208;passing neural&#8208;network potentials. The first step allows for the rapid sampling of chemical structures with very little prior knowledge required; the second step affords state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy and predictive power. We apply the method to the thermal reduction of GO, which we describe in a realistic (ten&#8208;nanometre scale) structural model. Our simulations are consistent with recent experimental findings, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and help to rationalise them in atomistic and mechanistic detail. More generally, our work provides a platform for routine, accurate, and predictive simulations of diverse carbonaceous materials.

         <title>Integrating Machine Learning and Large Language Models to Advance Exploration of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we integrate machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to accelerate the exploration of electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions. A rapid screening platform is developed for experimental screening, while LLMs assist in literature mining and generate Python code to train ML models for reactivity prediction and synthesis optimization. This human&#8208;AI collaboration enables synthetic chemists to streamline discovery processes and optimize reaction conditions efficiently.







Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions offer a sustainable route to functionalize hydrocarbons, yet identifying suitable substrates and optimizing synthesis remain challenging. Here, we report an integrated approach combining machine learning and large language models to streamline the exploration of electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions. Utilizing a batch rapid screening electrochemical platform, we evaluated a wide range of reactions, initially classifying substrates by their reactivity, while LLMs text&#8208;mined literature data to augment the training set. The resulting ML models for reactivity prediction achieved high accuracy (&gt;90&#8201;%) and enabled virtual screening of a large set of commercially available molecules. To optimize reaction conditions for selected substrates, LLMs were prompted to generate code that iteratively improved yields. This human&#8208;AI collaboration proved effective, efficiently identifying high&#8208;yield conditions for 8 drug&#8208;like substances or intermediates. Notably, we benchmarked the accuracy and reliability of 12 different LLMs&#8211;including LLaMA series, Claude series, OpenAI o1, and GPT&#8208;4&#8208;on code generation and function calling related to ML based on natural language prompts given by chemists to showcase potentials for accelerating research across four diverse tasks. In addition, we collected an experimental benchmark dataset comprising 1071 reaction conditions and yields for electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds Weaken Interaction Between Solvents and Small Organic Molecules Towards Superior Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular hydrogen bonds strategy is first proposed to solve the dissolution issue of small organic cathode materials. This strategy is performed on the TPNQ molecule and is verified to be highly efficient in terms of suppressing dissolution and improving kinetics by redistributing molecular charge and weakening the interaction between the TPNQ molecule and solvents. Li//TPNQ batteries display excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
The strong interaction between organic electrode materials (OEMs) and electrolyte components induces a high solubility tendency of OEMs, thus hindering the practical application of lithium&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tris (1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]imidazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether&#8208; and ester&#8208;based solvents. In situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1; 88.4&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), fast Li+&#8208;storage kinetics (211&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and surprising low&#8208;temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Tri&#8208;Axis Naphthalenes via Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction and Dehydrative Aromatization of Isobenzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were successfully synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization, using modular 1,3&#8208;biaryl&#8208;isobenzofurans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as reaction partners. Based on these novel tri&#8208;axis structural skeletons, a CPL&#8208;active dye with high values of |glum| (0.019) and &#216;FL (0.29) was obtained, demonstrating the great potential of triaxially chiral ring scaffolds in the design of chiroptical organic materials.







Abstract
Atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes have attracted much attention due to their increasing significance in the fields of natural products, chiral materials, and drug discoveries. However, the catalytic stereoselective construction of axially chiral ring scaffolds with more than two axes on a single benzene ring remains a challenging task. Herein, we present an efficient method for synthesizing triaxially chiral polysubstituted naphthalene scaffolds via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of isobenzofurans and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization reaction. Using 1,3&#8208;biarylisobenzofurans and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as modular reaction partners, a series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, by attaching two pyrene chromophores to this novel triaxially chiral ring scaffold, a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active dye exhibiting a remarkable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#8722;0.019) and high fluorescence quantum efficiency (&#216;FL=0.29) was obtained, highlighting the potential applications of atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes in the design of chiroptical organic materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photochemical Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) show merits in light harvesting, charge transfer, mass transport and abundant active sites, which enable them to act as favorable platforms to achieve efficient photochemical transformations, especially H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, and O2 reduction. The challenges and opportunities for extending 2D c&#8208;MOFs towards other photochemical applications are also presented.







Abstract
Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth&#8208;abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo&#8208;induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co&#8208;catalysts onto 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c&#8208;MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.

         <title>Stimulating the Potential of Zn Anodes to Operate in Low pH and Harsh Environments forHighly Sustainable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy for Zn anodes using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers to enable stable operation in acidic electrolytes (pH = 2.2). This approach achieves over 3,600 hours of stable Zn stripping/plating and enables Zn||Mn batteries to operate with high voltage output. Notably, seawater&#8208;based pouch cells demonstrate a practical energy density of 57.4 Wh/kg, highlighting seawater&#8242;s potential as an economical electrolyte solvent for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Compared to near&#8208;neutral electrolytes (pH=3&#8211;6), Zn||Mn batteries in acidic environments can achieve voltages up to ~2&#8197;V. However, high proton concentrations raise concerns about Zn anode stability. Current strategies for inhibiting hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) on the anode in Zn&#8208;based batteries mainly focus on the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. To supplement this gap, we developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers for Zn anodes to demonstrate the potential of Zn anode to operate in acidic electrolytes. This approach enables stable Zn stripping/plating at pH=2.2 for over 3,600&#8197;h and 400&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Benefiting from stable Zn electrodes, the electrolytic Zn||Mn batteries can operate at 1.90&#8197;V. To show more harsh scenarios, the seawater&#8208;based 0.25&#8197;Ah&#8208;scale Zn||Mn pouch cells can be assembled with a practical energy density of 57.4&#8197;Wh&#8201; kg&#8208;1 cell. Significantly, we analyze and emphasize that seawater holds promise as an alternative to deionized water for electrolyte solvents due to its energy and economic effectiveness. This strategy has motivated to expand the working pH range of metal anodes and provides the rational design for grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies.

         <title>Chiroptical Amplification of [7]&#8208;Helicene Nanographene by Additional Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;extended helical nanographenes have been explored for their optical and chiroptical properties. The introduction of an additional helical subunit with preferred handedness controls and boosts the optical and chiroptical properties including dissymmetry factor (glum), fluorescence quantum yield (&#966;), and circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) of the helical nanographene.







Abstract
Nanographenes have captivated scientific interest since the pioneering discovery of graphene. Recently, attention has shifted towards exploring chiral and nonplanar nanographenes, for their distinct optical, chiroptical, and electronic properties. Despite the growing acceptance of helicenes, the research on inducing helical chirality on &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives to boost chiroptical properties remains unattended. In our study, we introduce a new &#960;&#8208;extended [7]&#8208;helicene resulting from the condensation of diamines with 3,6&#8208;dibromophenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione, complemented by two hexabenzocoronene arms in the periphery. Notably, the nanographene containing binaphtho&#8208;[1,4]diazocine, compared to the corresponding phenazine, exhibits a remarkable average 2.5, 5, and 10&#8208;fold enhancements in quantum yield, dissymmetry factor, and brightness, respectively, when measured in five different solvents. These improvements underscore the significance of the induced helical chirality by the antiaromatic binaphtho&#8208;[1,4]diazocine in influencing the chiroptical properties of the helical nanographene. Our research represents a significant stride toward unlocking the potential of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and lays the groundwork for further exploration in designing and synthesizing new chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Development of New Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the rapid growth of computer processing power, the computer played an increasingly important role in structure and property predictions, synthesis route optimization, knowledge discovery, generative inverse design, and computer&#8208;aided &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; routes brought unprecedented opportunities for the efficient exploration of new DUV, UV, and IR NLO materials with targeted properties.







Abstract
Exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is an urgent need for advanced photoelectric technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is an urgent need for advanced photoelectric technologies. However, the discovery of new materials with targeted properties is time-consuming, and involves various challenges by the traditional trial-and-error experiments. Recently, the theoretical prediction-guided structural design has been demonstrated as a feasible way for efficiently developing new NLO materials, and a large number of NLO candidates with excellent optical properties have been explored. To promote the development of high-performance NLO materials, this review provides a summary on the exploration of new NLO materials aided by computer, with a particular emphasis on the state-of-the-art research advances that including crystal structure predictions, optical &amp;amp; thermal property calculations, high-throughput screening of NLO materials with or without machine learning; and the progress achieved in the computer-assisted design and development of new deep ultraviolet (DUV), ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) NLO materials in various material systems: oxide, chalcogenide, nitride, and halide. Finally, the opportunities and forthcoming challenges in the fascinating field are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Oxidation Reactions of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Allylic Primary Alcohols by an Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unspecific peroxygenase rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and aldehyde/acid products, respectively. Both reactions were performed on a preparative scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic substrates using only hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant. The PaDa&#8722;I variant of the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform E/Z mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram&#8208;scale transformation. These reactions provide further evidence for the potential of UPOs as catalysts for the scalable preparation of important oxygenated intermediates.

         <title>Single Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Quantum Dots for Multicolor, Bright and Efficient Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and universal strategy for producing efficient solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with a distinctive non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance has been developed. Using this new type of single solid&#8208;state emissive CQDs, bright, multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with tunable emission peaks ranging from 535 to 640&#8197;nm have been successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on quantum dots (QDs) are rapidly emerging as a key technology for next&#8208;generation full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting. However, achieving broad color tunability in LEDs that utilize a single QD emissive material continues to pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first example of bright, multicolor electroluminescent LEDs with tunable emission peaks spanning from 535 to 640&#8197;nm, utilizing a new type of single red solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (R&#8208;SSCQDs). Unlike conventional CQDs, which often exhibit weak or negligible emission in solid&#8208;state form, R&#8208;SSCQDs demonstrate bright red emission in solid state and green emission in diluted state. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the unique non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance of R&#8208;SSCQDs effectively suppress &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, resulting in efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission. By adjusting the weight ratios of R&#8208;SSCQDs doped in host materials, we showcase bright, efficient and multicolor CQD&#8208;based LEDs that emit green, yellow, orange, and red light, achieving a record&#8208;high luminance of 15,834&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and current efficiency of 10.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1. This work presents a straightforward and universal strategy for creating efficient solid&#8208;state emissive CQDs, showcasing significant potential for color&#8208;tunable LED applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Nuclearity Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks were constructed from giant {W58} and {W64} via controlled stepwise assembly from {W48} precursor, and the nanosheets derived from exfoliation of 2D layer&#8208;like {W64}&#8208;based MOF exhibited much enhanced activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are attractive building blocks (BBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their high connectivity and inherently multiple metal centers as functional sites. This work demonstrates a strategy of step&#8208;wise growth on ring&#8208;shaped [P8W48O184]40&#8722; precursor, which produced two new high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxotungstates, a half&#8208;closed [H16P8W58O218]32&#8722; {W58} and a fully&#8208;closed [H16P8W64O236]32&#8722; {W64}. By in situ synthesis, unique MOFs of copper triazole&#8208;benzoic acid (HL) complexes incorporating the negatively&#8208;charged {W58} and {W64} as nodes, {Cu11(HL)9W58} HNPOMOF&#8208;1 and {Cu9(HL)9W64} HNPOMOF&#8208;2, were constructed by delicately tuning the reaction conditions, mainly solution pH, which controls the formation of {W58} and {W64}, and at the same time the protonation of triazole&#8208;benzoic acid ligand thus its coordination mode to copper ion that creates the highest nuclearity POM&#8208;derived MOFs reported to date. HNPOMOF&#8208;1 features 3D framework possessing cage&#8208;like cavities filled with exposed carboxyl groups, while the inherent 2D layer&#8208;like HNPOMOF&#8208;2 allows for facile exfoliation into ultrathin nanosheets, and the resulted HNPOMOF&#8208;2NS exhibits superior activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C bond for a series of lignin models. This work not only provides a strategy to build high&#8208;nuclearity POM cluster&#8208;based frameworks, but also demonstrates their great potential as functional materials for green catalysis.
