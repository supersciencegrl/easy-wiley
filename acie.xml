         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of artificial ight&#8208;harvesting systems mimicking the natural photosynthesis process is an ever&#8208;growing field of research. Numerous systems such as polymers, metal complexes, POFs, COFs, supramolecular frameworks etc. have been fabricated to accomplish more efficient energy transfer and storage. Among them, the supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) formed by non&#8208;covalent metal&#8208;ligand interaction, have shown the capacity to not only undergo single and multistep energy migration but also to utilize the harvested energy for a wide variety of applications such as photocatalysis, tunable emissive systems, encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, white light emitters etc. This review sheds light on the light&#8208;harvesting behavior of both the 2D metallacycles and 3D metallacages where design ingenuity has been executed to afford energy harvesting by both donor ligands as well as metal acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics Controlled Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization control of perovskite thin films is the key in commerciallization of perovskite solar cells. However, the fast crystallization of the thin film including nucleation, growth and Oswald ripening, is still a mystery though some efforts made. According to the theories of nucleation and Oswald ripening, we modified the perovskite surface energy and improved the grain solubility, and quantified the nucleation and ripening rate in experiments. These quantified parameters will facilitate the model building in perovskite crystallization for further industry production.Finally, the optimized films were applied in solar cells to improve efficiency from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;% with VOC of 1.175&#8197;V and FF of 83.53. Furthermore, the excellent ambient stability, light stability and thermal stability are obtained. This work paves the way for controls on overall crystallization kinetics of perovskite films, including nucleation, growth and ripening.







Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have recently developed rapidly compared to crystalline silicon solar cells. To have an effective way to control the crystallization of perovskite thin films is the key for achieving good device performance. However, a paradox in perovskite crystallization is from the mismatch between nucleation and Oswald ripening. Usually, the large numbers of nucleation sites tend to weak Oswald ripening. Here, we proposed a new mechanism to promote the formation of nucleation sites by reducing surface energy from 44.9&#8197;mN/m to 36.1&#8197;mN/m, to spontaneously accelerate the later Oswald ripening process by improving the grain solubility through the elastic modulus regulation. The ripening rate is increased from 2.37&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 to 4.61&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 during annealing. Finally, the solar cells derived from the optimized films showed significantly improved PCE from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;%. The long&#8208;term stability tests show excellent thermal stability (the optimized device without encapsulation maintaining 82&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 800&#8197;h aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C) and an improved light stability under illumination. This work provides a new method, the elastic modulus regulation, to enhance the ripening process.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Based Probes for Imaging Detection of Enzyme Activities by NIR Luminescence, T1&#8208; and ParaCEST MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applying a single molecular probe to monitor enzymatic activities in multiple, complementary imaging modalities is highly desirable to ascertain detection and to avoid the complexity associated with the use of agents of different chemical entities. We demonstrate here the versatility of lanthanide (Ln3+) complexes with respect to their optical and magnetic properties and their potential for enzymatic detection in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1 MR imaging, controlled by the nature of the Ln3+ ion, while using a unique chelator. Based on X&#8208;ray structural, photophysical, and solution NMR investigations of a family of Ln3+ DO3A&#8208;pyridine model complexes, we could rationalize the luminescence (Eu3+, Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and relaxation (Gd3+) properties and their variations between carbamate and amine derivatives. This allowed the design of &#160;probes which undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated changes detectable in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI, respectively governed by variations in their absorption energy, in their exchanging proton pool and in their size, thus relaxation efficacy. We demonstrate that these properties can be exploited for the visualization of b&#8208;galactosidase activity in phantom samples by different imaging modalities: NIR optical imaging, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Stapling via Crosslinking Two Amines with a&#8208;Ketoaldehydes through Diverse Modified Glyoxal&#8208;Lysine Dimer Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes play versatile roles in the ubiquitous natural processes of protein glycation. However, leveraging the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes for biomedical applications has been challenging. Previously, the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes with guanidine has been harnessed to design probes for labeling Arg residues on proteins in an aqueous medium. Herein, a highly effective, broadly applicable, and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by crosslinking two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents is described. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent facilitates rapid and clean reactions under mild conditions and enables unique selectivity for Lys over Arg. The naturally occurring GOLD/MOLD linkers have been expanded to encompass a wide range of modified glyoxal&#8208;lysine dimer (OLD) linkers. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, these modular stapling reactions enabled a convenient two&#8208;round strategy to streamline the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study of the wasp venom peptide anoplin, leading to enhanced biological activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored&#160;Exfoliation of Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and CH4 Valorization Mediated by O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exfoliation of bulk C3N4 (BCN) into ultrathin layered structure is an effective strategy to boost photocatalytic efficiency by exposing interior active sites and accelerating charge separation and transportation. Herein, we report a novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8211;decomposition (NID) strategy that is effective in peeling off BCN into few&#8208;layer C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tailored thickness down to bi&#8208;layer. This strategy only involves hydrothermal treatment of BCN in diluted HNO3 aqueous solution, followed by pyrolysis at various temperatures. The decomposition of the nitrate anions not only exfoliates BCN and changes the band structure, but also incorporates oxygen species onto fl&#8208;CN, which is conducive to O2 adsorption and hence relevant chemical processes. In photocatalytic O2 reduction under visible light irradiation, the H2O2 production rate over the optimal fl&#8208;CN&#8208;530 catalyst is 952 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, which is 8.8 times that over BCN. More importantly, under full arc irradiation and in the absence of hole scavenger, CH4 can be photocatalytically oxidized by on&#8208;site formed H2O2 and active oxygen species to generate value&#8208;added C1 oxygenates with high selectivity of 99.2% and record&#8208;high production rate of 1893 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 among the metal&#8208;free C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Steroidal 9&#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation and Fragmentation Enable the Concise Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Secosteroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>9,10&#8208;Secosteroids are an important group of marine steroids with diverse biological activities. Herein, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for the concise, modular, and scalable synthesis of ten naturally occurring 9,10&#8208;secosteroids from readily available steroids in three to eight steps. The key feature lies in utilizing a Rieske oxygenase&#8208;like 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as the biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8211;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation. With synthesized 9,10&#8208;secosteroides, structure&#8208;activity relationship was evaluated based on bioassays in terms of previously unexplored anti&#8208;infective activity. This study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the biosynthetic pathway through which 9,10&#8208;secosteroids are formed in nature shares a similar reaction cascade. In addition to the development of a biomimetic approach for 9,10&#8208;secosteroid synthesis, this study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolinyl Phosphoramidates of Nucleotides with Increased Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prolinyl nucleotides with increased reactivity were created by introducing additional substituents to the prolinyl ring. Both alkyl and carboxyl groups increase the rate of nucleotide release and enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying, demonstrating how powerful prolines are as leaving groups.







Abstract
Nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) are the subunits of RNA. They are incorporated into growing complementary strands when sequences are copied in enzyme&#8208;free reactions using organic leaving groups at the phosphates. Amino acids are rarely considered as leaving groups, but proline can act as a leaving group when N&#8208;linked to NMPs, so that prolinyl NMPs hydrolyze in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, with half&#8208;life times as short as 2.4&#8197;h, and they act as monomers in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Still, their level of reactivity is insufficient for practical purposes, requiring months for some extensions. Herein we report the synthesis of eight substituted prolinyl AMPs together with seven related compounds and the results of a study of their reactivity. A &#948;&#8208;carboxy prolinyl NMP was found to be converted with a half&#8208;life time of just 11&#8197;min in magnesium&#8208;free buffer, and a &#948;&#8208;isopropyl prolinyl NMP was shown to react sevenfold faster than its prolinyl counterpart in enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. Our results indicate that both anchimeric and steric effects can be employed to increase the reactivity of aminoacidyl nucleotides, i.e. compounds that combine two fundamental classes of biomolecules in one functional entity.

         <title>Switching Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Pathways through Electronic Tuning of Copper Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu porphyrins with fine&#8208;tuned electronic structures are synthesized and examined as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytically active species switches from a formal CuI species to a formal Cu0 species upon decreasing the electron density of these Cu porphyrins. This work presents an unparalleled example of regulating hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism via electronic tuning of catalysts.







Abstract
The electronic structure of metal complexes plays key roles in determining their catalytic features. However, controlling electronic structures to regulate reaction mechanisms is of fundamental interest but has been rarely presented. Herein, we report electronic tuning of Cu porphyrins to switch pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through controllable and regioselective &#946;&#8208;oxidation of Cu porphyrin 1, we synthesized analogues 2&#8211;4 with one or two &#946;&#8208;lactone groups in either a cis or trans configuration. Complexes 1&#8211;4 have the same Cu&#8208;N4 core site but different electronic structures. Although &#946;&#8208;oxidation led to large anodic shifts of reductions, 1&#8211;4 displayed similar HER activities in terms of close overpotentials. With electrochemical, chemical and theoretical results, we show that the catalytically active species switches from a CuI species for 1 to a Cu0 species for 4. This work is thus significant to present mechanism&#8208;controllable HER via electronic tuning of catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis and Detection of BODIPY&#8208;, Biotin&#8208;, and 19F&#8208; Labeled Single&#8208;Entity Dendritic Heparan Sulfate Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeled single&#8208;entity heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized to investigate their cellular distribution, involvement with the immune system, and biodistribution. A fluorescently labeled HS mimetic was observed in the brain of mice and was shown to preferentially associate with immune cells from the tumor site rather than from the spleen. The compounds reported represent a new tool box helping to unravel the mechanism of action of HS mimetics.







Abstract
Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are naturally occurring mammalian glycosaminoglycans, and their synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic mimetics have attracted significant interest as potential therapeutics. However, understanding the mechanism of action by which HS, heparin, and HS mimetics have a biological effect is difficult due to their highly charged nature, broad protein interactomes, and variable structures. To address this, a library of novel single&#8208;entity dendritic mimetics conjugated to BODIPY, Fluorine&#8208;19 (19F), and biotin was synthesized for imaging and localization studies. The novel dendritic scaffold allowed for the conjugation of labeling moieties without reducing the number of sulfated capping groups, thereby better mimicking the multivalent nature of HS&#8208;protein interactions. The 19F labeled mimetics were assessed in phantom studies and were detected at concentrations as low as 5&#8197;mM. Flow cytometric studies using a fluorescently labeled mimetic showed that the compound associated with immune cells from tumors more readily than splenic counterparts and was directed to endosomal&#8208;lysosomal compartments within immune cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, the fluorescently labeled mimetic entered the central nervous system and was detectable in brain&#8208;infiltrating immune cells 24&#8197;hours after treatment. Here, we report the enabling methodology for rapidly preparing various labeled HS mimetics and molecular probes with diverse potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Molecular and Structural Basis for C&#947;&#8722;C Bond Formation by PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Fub7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fub7, a pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme, catalyzes stereoselective and substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective C&#947;&#8722;C bond formations. Now a structural and enzymological study have elucidated the structural and molecular underpinnings of its catalytic specificity and selectivity, paving the way for harnessing its activity in the synthesis of cyclic noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze &#947;&#8208;replacement reactions are prevalent, yet their utilization of carbon nucleophile substrates is rare. The recent discovery of two PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, CndF and Fub7, has unveiled unique C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities, enabling the biocatalytic synthesis of alkyl&#8208; substituted pipecolic acids from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine and &#946;&#8208;keto acid or aldehyde derived enolates. This breakthrough presents fresh avenues for the biosynthesis of pipecolic acid derivatives. However, the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes remain elusive, and a dearth of structural information hampers their extensive application. Here, we have broadened the catalytic scope of Fub7 by employing ketone&#8208;derived enolates as carbon nucleophiles, revealing Fub7&#8217;s capacity for substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of unsymmetrical ketones. Through an integrated approach combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and computational docking studies, we offer a detailed mechanistic insight into Fub7 catalysis. Our findings elucidate the structural basis for its substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity. Our work sets the stage ready for subsequent protein engineering effort aimed at expanding the synthetic utility of Fub7, potentially unlocking novel methods to access a broader array of noncanonical amino acids.

         <title>A Boron Scan of Ethyl Acetoacetate Leads to Versatile Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry. This study presents borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. We show how the corresponding building blocks can be converted into borylated heterocycles. The regiochemistry of homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates was found to be related to the steric bulk of the diazo species.







Abstract
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry, including its pedagogy and applications. In this study, we present borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. A boron handle has been installed at either 
&#8208; or 
&#8208;position of acetoacetate by homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates. Either alkyl or boryl groups were found to migrate with regiochemistry being a function of the steric bulk of the diazo species. Boryl 
&#8208;ketoesters can be further modified into borylated pyrazolones and oximes, thereby expanding the synthetic toolkit and offering opportunities for additional modifications.

         <title>Metastable Liquid Properties and Surface Flow Patterns of Ultrahigh Temperature Alloys Explored in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K was achieved by the Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy in outer space, inducing surface nucleation and rapid solidification. High spherical alloy droplets assure precise determination of liquid properties. High&#8208;temperature liquid&#8216;s chemical bonds and atomic structures were revealed.







Abstract
The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000&#8197;K remain a huge challenge for ground&#8208;based research on liquid materials chemistry. We show the strong undercooling capability, metastable liquid properties and surface wave patterns of refractory Nb&#8722;Si and Zr&#8722;V binary alloys explored in space environment. The floating droplet of Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy superheated up to 2338&#8197;K exhibited an extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K, approaching the 0.2TE threshold for homogeneous nucleation of liquid&#8208;solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr64V36 alloy surface during liquid&#8208;solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.

         <title>Reversible Radical Addition Guides Selective Photocatalytic Intermolecular Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Ene Molecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox three&#8208;component coupling of thiols with readily available alkynes and alkenes has been developed. The reaction mechanism was evaluated by combining ESI&#8208;HRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling and control experiments. The applicability of the reversible radical addition approach for intermolecular reactions and the key role of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in stereoselectivity control have been shown by DFT studies.







Abstract
In modern organic chemistry, harnessing the power of multicomponent radical reactions presents both significant challenges and extraordinary potential. This article delves into this scientific frontier by addressing the critical issue of controlling selectivity in such complex processes. We introduce a novel approach that revolves around the reversible addition of thiyl radicals to multiple bonds, reshaping the landscape of multicomponent radical reactions. The key to selectivity lies in the intricate interplay between reversibility and the energy landscapes governing C&#8722;C bond formation in thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reactions. The developed approach not only allows to prioritize the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene cascade, dominating over alternative reactions, but also extends the scope of coupling products obtained from alkenes and alkynes of various structures and electron density distributions, regardless of their relative polarity difference, opening doors to more versatile synthetic possibilities. In the present study, we provide a powerful tool for atom&#8208;economical C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, paving the way for the efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Carrying out our experimental and computational studies, we elucidated the fundamental mechanisms underlying radical cascades, a knowledge that can be broadly applied in the field of organic chemistry.

         <title>Grafting Ultra&#8208;fine Nanoalloys with Amorphous Skin Enables Highly Active and Long&#8208;lived Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of grafting PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; onto ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys achieved the effects of three birds with one stone: improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface, increased the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, and mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic environments.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale deployment of proton exchange membranes water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE) requires a substantial reduction in usage of platinum group metals (PGMs) as indispensable electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ultra&#8208;fine PGMs nanocatalysts possess abundant catalytic sites at lower loading, but usually exhibit reduced stability in long&#8208;term operations under corrosive acidic environments. Here we report grafting the ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys with PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; (c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez) by in situ atomic layer selenation to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and stability. We found that the c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez&#8208;1 with ~0.6&#8197;nm thickness amorphous skin achieved an ultra&#8208;high mass activity of 26.7&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt+Ru at &#8722;0.07&#8197;V as well as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability maintained for at least 1000&#8197;h at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 550&#8197;h at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 for acid HER. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the amorphous skin not only improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, but also mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. This work demonstrates a direction of designing ultra&#8208;fine PGMs electrocatalysts both with high utilization and robust durability, offers an in situ &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; engineering strategy.

         <title>Tuning the Absorption, Fluorescence, Intramolecular Charge Transfer, and Intersystem Crossing in Spiro[fluorene]acridinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design and photophysical investigation of donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one uncover the complex interplay among different light&#8208;driven pathways, including intramolecular charge transfer, fluorescence, and intersystem crossing. This investigation offers important guidance for designing novel functional materials for triplet sensitizers and fluorescent sensors.







Abstract
In this work, we prepared a series of electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one (SFDBAO). Our SFDBAOs consist of orthogonally positioned fluorenes and aromatic ketones. By fine&#8208;tuning the substitution of electron&#8208;donating pyrenes, the complex interplay among different excited&#8208;state decay channels and the overall impact of solvents on these decay channels were uncovered. Placing pyrene, for example, at the aromatic ketones resulted in a profound solvatochromism in the form of a bright charge&#8208;transfer (CT) emission spanning from yellow to red&#8208;NIR. In contrast, a dark non&#8208;emissive CT was noted upon pyrene substitution at the fluorenes. In apolar solvents, efficient triplet&#8208;excited state generation was observed for all SFDBAOs. Either charge transfer was concluded to mediate the intersystem crossing (ISC) in the case of pyrene substitution or the El&#8208;Sayed rule was applicable when lacking pyrene substitution as in the case of SFABAO. In polar solvents, charge separation is the sole decay upon pyrene substitution. Moreover, competition between ISC and CT lowered the triplet&#8208;excited state generation in SFDBAO.

&lt;p&gt;The rational design and photophysical investigation of donor-acceptor dyads based on spiro[fluorene-9,7&#8217;-dibenzo[c,h]acridine]-5&#8217;-one uncover the complex interplay among different light-driven pathways, including intramolecular charge transfer, fluorescence, and intersystem crossing. This investigation offers important guidance for designing novel functional materials for triplet sensitizers and fluorescent sensors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we prepared a series of electron donor-acceptor systems based on spiro[fluorene-9,7&#8217;-dibenzo[c,h]acridine]-5&#8217;-one (SFDBAO). Our SFDBAOs consist of orthogonally positioned fluorenes and aromatic ketones. By fine-tuning the substitution of electron-donating pyrenes, the complex interplay among different excited-state decay channels and the overall impact of solvents on these decay channels were uncovered. Placing pyrene, for example, at the aromatic ketones resulted in a profound solvatochromism in the form of a bright charge-transfer (CT) emission spanning from yellow to red-NIR. In contrast, a dark non-emissive CT was noted upon pyrene substitution at the fluorenes. In apolar solvents, efficient triplet-excited state generation was observed for all SFDBAOs. Either charge transfer was concluded to mediate the intersystem crossing (ISC) in the case of pyrene substitution or the El-Sayed rule was applicable when lacking pyrene substitution as in the case of SFABAO. In polar solvents, charge separation is the sole decay upon pyrene substitution. Moreover, competition between ISC and CT lowered the triplet-excited state generation in SFDBAO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Additive Enables High Moisture Tolerance and Favorable Electric Double Layer for Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The in situ generated nitrogenous and fluoride&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase with LTFAN vastly accelerates the interfacial reaction dynamics, and dual&#8208;salt additive notably strengthens the moisture tolerance. A thermodynamically favorable electric double layer at charged cathode interface is constructed.







Abstract
The carbonate electrolyte chemistry is a primary determinant for the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, their implementation is greatly plagued by sluggish electrode interfacial dynamics and insufficient electrolyte thermodynamic stability. Herein, lithium trifluoroacetate&#8208;lithium nitrate (LiTFA&#8722;LiNO3) dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. We reveal that 1) the in situ generated inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI) enables rapid interfacial dynamics, 2) TFA&#8722; preferentially interacts with moisture over PF6&#8722; to strengthen the moisture tolerance of designed electrolyte, and 3) NO3&#8722; is found to be noticeably enriched at the cathode interface on charging, thus constructing Li+&#8208;enriched, solvent&#8208;coordinated, thermodynamically favorable electric double layer (EDL). The superior moisture tolerance of LTFAN and the thermodynamically stable EDL constructed at cathode interface play a decisive role in upgrading the compatibility of carbonate electrolyte with high&#8208;voltage cathode. The LMBs with LTFAN realize 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;NCM523/4.4&#8197;V&#8208;NCM622 superior cycling reversibility and excellent rate capability, which is the leading level of documented records for carbonate electrode.

         <title>Concentrated Formic Acid from CO2 Electrolysis for Directly Driving Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The continuous production of pure formic acid solution with high concentration (2&#8197;M) for more than 300&#8197;h was achieved by using an MEA electrolyzer containing solid state electrolytes equipped with our developed moist heat ventilation collection system. The resultant formic acid could directly serve as the fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, which closed the carbon cycle loop of the formic acid economy.







Abstract
The production of formic acid via electrochemical CO2 reduction may serve as a key link for the carbon cycle in the formic acid economy, yet its practical feasibility is largely limited by the quantity and concentration of the product. Here we demonstrate continuous electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid production at 2&#8197;M at an industrial&#8208;level current densities (i.e., 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for 300&#8197;h on membrane electrode assembly using scalable lattice&#8208;distorted bismuth catalysts. The optimized catalysts also enable a Faradaic efficiency for formate of 94.2&#8201;% and a highest partial formate current density of 1.16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, reaching a production rate of 21.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. To assess the practicality of this system, we perform a comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis and life cycle assessment, showing that our approach can potentially substitute conventional methyl formate hydrolysis for industrial formic acid production. Furthermore, the resultant formic acid serves as direct fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, boasting a power density of 55&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an exceptional thermal efficiency of 20.1&#8201;%.

         <title>Nanoscale Visualization of Lithium Plating/Stripping Tuned by On&#8208;site Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Using in situ methods of atomic force microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical microscopy, we visualized the processes of Li plating, stripping and replating tuned by the on&#8208;site formed SEI at the argyrodite solid&#8208;electrolyte/Li anode interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Our work provides insights into correlations between the interfacial evolution and cell performance, contributing to the improvement of solid&#8208;state energy devices.







Abstract
The interfacial processes, mainly the lithium (Li) plating/stripping and the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), are directly related to the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLBs). However, the complex processes at solid&#8208;solid interfaces are embedded under the solid&#8208;state electrolyte, making it challenging to analyze the dynamic processes in real time. Here, using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, we directly visualized the Li plating/stripping/replating behavior, and measured the morphological and mechanical properties of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at nanoscale. Li spheres plating/stripping/replating at the argyrodite solid electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl)/Li electrode interface is coupled with the formation/wrinkling/inflating of the SEI on its surface. Combined with in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, details of the stepwise formation and physicochemical properties of SEI on the Li spheres are obtained. It is shown that higher operation rates can decrease the uniformity of the Li+&#8208;conducting networks in the SEI and worsen Li plating/stripping reversibility. By regulating the applied current rates, uniform nucleation and reversible plating/stripping processes can be achieved, leading to the extension of the cycling life. The in situ analysis of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at solid&#8208;solid interfaces provides the correlation between the interfacial evolution and the electrochemical performance in ASSLBs.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Zn Metal via a Localized Conjugated Layer for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based zinc ion conductor (CPANZ) with a localized conjugated structure is induced and achieved at low temperature by Lewis acidic Zn(OTf)2. The CPANZ layer effectively accelerates the Zn2+ migration but restricts the H+ migration. Encouragingly, the chemical corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction and other side reactions are significantly mitigated at the CPANZ@Zn anode and homogeneous Zn deposition/dissolution is guaranteed.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as promising and efficient energy storage systems owing to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. Nevertheless, the instability of zinc metal anodes, characterized by issues such as dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions, poses a significant barrier to widespread applications. Herein, we address this challenge by designing a localized conjugated structure comprising a cyclic polyacrylonitrile polymer (CPANZ), induced by a Zn2+&#8208;based Lewis acid (zinc trifluoromethylsulfonate) at a temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C. The CPANZ layer on the Zn anode, enriched with appropriate pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich groups (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;), exhibits a notable affinity for Zn2+ with ample deposition sites. This zincophilic skeleton not only serves as a protective layer to guide the deposition of Zn2+ but also functions as proton channel blocker, regulating the proton flux to mitigate the hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the strong adhesion strength of the CPANZ layer guarantees its sustained protection to the Zn metal during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, the modified zinc electrode demonstrates long cycle life and high durability in both half&#8208;cell and pouch cells. These findings present a feasible approach to designing high performance aqueous anodes by introducing a localized conjugated layer.

         <title>Conditional Cooperativity in RAS Assembly Pathways on Nanodiscs and Altered GTPase Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and NMR revealed the structural mechanism for the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of both wild&#8208;type and oncogenic mutants of native, fully processed KRAS on the membrane. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers by reducing GTP hydrolysis and increasing GDP/GTP exchange.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assemblies (i.e., nanoclusters) of the RAS GTPase on the membrane act as scaffolds that activate downstream RAF kinases and drive MAPK signaling for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic details of nanoclustering remain largely unknown. Here, size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analyses revealed the structural basis of the cooperative assembly processes of fully processed KRAS, mutated in a quarter of human cancers. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Notably, the oncogenic mutants assemble in nonsequential pathways with two mutually cooperative &#8216;&#945;/&#945;&#8217; and &#8216;&#945;/&#946;&#8217; interfaces, while &#945;/&#945; dimerization of wild&#8208;type KRAS promotes the secondary &#945;/&#946; interaction sequentially. Mutation&#8208;based interface engineering was used to selectively trap the oligomeric intermediates of KRAS and probe their favorable interface interactions. Transiently exposed interfaces were available for the assembly. Real&#8208;time NMR demonstrated that higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers in KRAS GTPase cycling. These data provide a deeper understanding of the nanocluster&#8208;enhanced signaling in response to the environment. Furthermore, our methodology is applicable to assemblies of many other membrane GTPases and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based formulations of stable protein oligomers with enhanced cooperativity.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Tailored Polymer Molecular Weights for Specific Photovoltaic Applications through Ultrasound&#8208;Induced Simultaneous Physical and Chemical Events</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonication&#8208;assisted polymerization is useful method to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymer with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers molecular weights with high reproducibility.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymers with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. Once such an easily accessible methodology is established, which can not only contribute to overcome the current limitation of the statistically determined nature of semiconducting polymers, but also facilitate rapid incorporation into the broad synthetic chemists&#8217; toolbox. Here, we describe a simple yet robust ultrasonication&#8208;assisted Stille polymerization for accessing semiconducting polymers with high&#8208;precision tailored molecular weights (from low to ultrahigh molecular weight ranges) while mitigating their interbatch variations. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers&#8217; molecular weights with high reproducibility to satisfy all the optical/electrical and morphological demands of diverse types of high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer&#8208;based devices; as demonstrated in in&#8208;depth experimental screenings in applications of both organic and perovskite photovoltaics. We believe that this methodology provides a fast development of new and existing semiconducting polymers with the highest&#8208;level performances possible on various photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Bioengineered Nanovesicle Vaccine Boosts T&#8208;B cell Interaction for Immunotherapy of Echinococcus multilocularis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a nanovesicle vaccine that displays multiple epitope peptides of Echinococcus multilocularis on the surface. The vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit Echinococcus multilocularis infection.







Abstract
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease, resulting from being infected with the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis (E.&#8197;multilocularis). Novel prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed since the current chemotherapy displays limited efficiency in AE treatment. Bioengineered nano cellular membrane vesicles are widely used for displaying the native conformational epitope peptides because of their unique structure and biocompatibility. In this study, four T&#8208;cells and four B&#8208;cells dominant epitope peptides of E.&#8197;multilocularis with high immunogenicity were engineered into the Vero cell surface to construct a membrane vesicle nanovaccine for the treatment of AE. The results showed that the nanovesicle vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit E.&#8197;multilocularis infection. This study presents for the first time a nanovaccine strategy that can completely eliminate the burden of E.&#8197;multilocularis.

         <title>Bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Reaction&#8208;Triggered Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Combined with Released Lonidamine for Enhanced Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the application of bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between prodrug iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) and dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) to form highly photothermal&#8208;active nanoaggregates with synergistic drug release. The reactants of BCR reaction were grafted on surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and was proven both in vitro and in vivo to robustly enhance the therapeutic outcome of photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Cancer has been the most deadly disease, and 13 million cancer casualties are estimated to occur each year by 2030. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great interest due to its high spatiotemporal controllability and noninvasiveness. Due to the trade&#8208;off between particle size and photothermal efficiency of AuNPs, rational design is needed to realize aggregation of AuNPs into larger particles with desirable NIR adsorption in tumor site. Exploiting the bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between iminosydnone and cycloalkyne, aggregation of AuNPs can be achieved and attractively accompanied by the release of chemotherapeutic drug purposed to photothermal synergizing. We synthesize iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) as a prodrug and choose dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as the trigger of BCR reaction. A PEGylated AuNPs&#8208;based two&#8208;component nanoplatform consisting of prodrug&#8208;loaded AuNPs&#8208;ImLND and tumor&#8208;targeting peptide RGD&#8208;conjugated AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD is designed. In the therapeutic regimen, AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD are intravenously injected first for tumor&#8208;specific enrichment and retention. Once the arrival of AuNPs&#8208;ImLND injected later at tumor site, highly photothermally active nanoaggregates of AuNPs are formed via the BCR reaction between ImLND and DBCO. The simultaneous release of lonidamine further enhanced the therapeutic performance by sensitizing cancer cells to PTT.

         <title>The Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powdery h&#8208;BN with a micron&#8208;sized three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure was developed with a facile NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted approach based on reduced reaction temperature. It exhibited superior advantages in improving the electrochemical performance of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes compared with the commercial two&#8208;dimensional (2D) h&#8208;BN.







Abstract
Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two&#8208;dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three&#8208;dimensional (3D) h&#8208;BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize micron&#8208;sized 3D h&#8208;BN with a honeycomb&#8208;like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH3. Glucose facilitates the homogeneous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO4 and BO3) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O2&#8208;B&#8208;N and O&#8208;B&#8208;N2 intermediates before finally being reduced to BN3 by NH3. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide&#8208;based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% of 3D h&#8208;BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300&#8197;h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and retains 89&#8201;% of discharge capacity (138.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) after 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the LFP//Li full cell.

     alt="The Synthesis of Three-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer-Based Electrolyte for All-Solid-State Li Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powdery h-BN with a micron-sized three-dimensional (3D) structure was developed with a facile NaCl-glucose-assisted approach based on reduced reaction temperature. It exhibited superior advantages in improving the electrochemical performance of polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based electrolytes compared with the commercial two-dimensional (2D) h-BN.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two-dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three-dimensional (3D) h-BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl-glucose-assisted strategy to synthesize micron-sized 3D h-BN with a honeycomb-like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Glucose facilitates the homogeneous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-B-N and O-B-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates before finally being reduced to BN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide-based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% of 3D h-BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300&#8197;h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and retains 89&#8201;% of discharge capacity (138.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) after 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the LFP//Li full cell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptisorption of Nonporous Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptisortion tailored for nonporous polymers has been achieved by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen bonding and host&#8208;guest binding. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymeric crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals.







Abstract
Although our knowledge and understanding of adsorptions in natural and artificial systems has increased dramatically during the past century, adsorption associated with nonporous polymers remains something of a mystery, hampering applications. Here we demonstrate a model system for adaptisorption of nonporous polymers, wherein dative B&#8722;N bonds and host&#8208;guest binding units act as the kinetic and thermodynamic components, respectively. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymer crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals. Adaptisorption of nonporous polymer crystals not only extends the types of adsorption in which the sorbate molecules are integrated in a precise and orderly manner in the sorbent systems, but also provides a facile and accurate approach to the construction of polymeric materials with precise architectures and integrated functions.

         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for Ni2+ substitution of Co2+ to develop an oxide heterostructure on (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) for highly efficient electroreduction nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), where Ni plays a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary sites for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.







Abstract
Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8722; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8722;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.42&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO3&#8722;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH3 evolution.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Li2O2 Growth Behaviors in Li&#8722;O2 Batteries via Photo&#8208;Assistant Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Widely acknowledged that the capacity of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) should be strongly determined by growth behaviors of the discharge product of Li2O2 that follows both coexisting surface and solution growth pathways. However up until now, it remains still challenging to achieve dynamic modulation on Li2O2 morphologies. Herein, the photo&#8208;responsive Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on reduced oxide graphene (Au/rGO) have been utilized as cathode to manipulate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics by aid of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects. Thus, we can experimentally reveal the importance of matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration towards battery performance. Moreover, it is found that Li+ concentration polarization caused &#8220;sudden death&#8221; of LOBs is supposed to be just a form of suspended animation that could timely recover under irradiation. This work provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for the future battery design.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Utilization of Latent Heat in Erythritol&#8208;based Phase Change Materials as Solar Thermal Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar thermal fuels (STFs) have been particularly concerned as sustainable future energy due to their impressive ability to store solar energy in chemical bonds and controllably release thermal energy. However, currently studied STFs mainly focus on molecule&#8208;based materials with high photochemical activity, toxicity, and compromised features, which greatly restricts their applications in practical scenarios of solar energy utilization. Herein, we present a novel erythritol&#8208;based composite phase change material (PCM) as a new type of STFs with an outstanding capability to store solar energy as latent heat in its stable supercooling state and release thermal energy as needed. This composite PCM with stored thermal energy can be maintained stably at room temperature and subsequently release latent heat as high as 224.9 J/g during the crystallization process triggered by thermal stimuli. Remarkably, solar energy can be converted into latent heat stored in the composite PCM over months. Through mechanical stimulations, the released latent heat can increase the temperature of the composite up to 91 &#176;C. This work presents a new concept of using spatiotemporal storage and release of latent heat in PCMs for solar energy utilization, making it a potential candidate as STFs for developing future clean energy techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), distinguished by their maximum atom efficiency and precise control over the coordination and electronic properties of individual atoms, show great promise in electrocatalysis. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical performance of SACs requires the screening of electron transfer process at micro/nano scale. This research pioneers the use of electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrocatalytic reactions at individual SACs. It boasts sensitivity at the single photon level and temporal resolution down to 100 ms, enabling real&#8208;time capture of the electrochemical behavior of individual SACs during potential sweeping. Leveraging the direct correlation between ECL emission and heterogeneous electron transfer processes, we introduced photon flux density for quantitative analysis, unveiling the electrocatalytic efficiency of individual SACs. This approach systematically reveals the relationship between SACs based on different metal atoms and their peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity.

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical performance of SACs requires the screening of electron transfer process at micro/nano scale. This research pioneers the use of electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrocatalytic reactions at individual SACs. It boasts sensitivity at the single photon level and temporal resolution down to 100 ms, enabling real-time capture of the electrochemical behavior of individual SACs during potential sweeping. Leveraging the direct correlation between ECL emission and heterogeneous electron transfer processes, we introduced photon flux density for quantitative analysis, unveiling the electrocatalytic efficiency of individual SACs. This approach systematically reveals the relationship between SACs based on different metal atoms and their peroxidase (POD)-like activity. The outcomes contribute to a fundamental understanding of SACs and pave the way for designing SACs with diverse technological and industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclic Diaryl&#160;&#955;3&#8208;Bromanes as a Precursor for Regiodivergent Alkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity while using identical coupling partners. We have developed a new approach for regiodivergent synthesis using the dual character of hypervalent bromines. In addition to the recently reported reactivity of hypervalent bromines as aryne precursors, the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported. Accordingly, the development of these two complementary transformations allows for alteration of regioselectivity to furnish both&#160;ortho&#8208; and&#160;meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Conductive Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains as Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are often used for Li+ conduction as they can dissociate the Li salts efficiently. However, high entanglement of the chains and lack of pathways for rapid ion diffusion limit their applications in advanced batteries. Recent developments in ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) showed that their highly ordered structures provide efficient pathways for Li+ transport, solving the limitations of traditional PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Here, we present imidazolate COFs, PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, having methoxyethoxy chains, synthesized by Debus&#8211;Radziszewski multicomponent reactions and their ionized form, Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, showing a high Li+ conductivity of 8.81 mS cm&#8722;1 and a transference number of 0.974. The mechanism for such excellent electrochemical properties is that methoxyethoxy chains dissociate LiClO4, making free Li+, then those Li+ are transported through the imidazolate COFs&#8217; pores. The synthesized Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs formed a stable interface with Li metal. Thus, employing Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs as the solid electrolyte to assemble LiFePO4 batteries showed an initial discharge capacity of 119.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, and 82.0 % capacity and 99.9 % Coulombic efficiency were maintained after 400 cycles. These results show that iCOFs with ether chains synthesized via multicomponent reactions can create a new chapter for making solid electrolytes for advanced rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Complex Polyenes through Sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of trans&#8208;Styrenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes is presented. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization via a six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;palladacycle to afford tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization via a seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;palladacycle to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide.







Abstract
Sequential C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules containing multiple C&#8722;H bonds can efficiently lead to structural diversity. Herein we present the first chelation&#8208;assisted sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E&#8208;styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization by six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;cyclopalladation to result in tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization through seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;cyclopalladation to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes in up to 97&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99/1 E/Z selectivity, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide. The protocol is demonstrated to be widely applicable, tolerant to a wide range of functional groups and bioactive fragments, and suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as one&#8208;pot and two step preparation of trienes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the selectivity and reactivity.

         <title>Diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine (DPPH) Affords Late&#8208;Stage S&#8208;imination to access free&#8208;NH Sulfilimines and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free, and high&#8208;yielding sulfur&#8208;imination using O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine to access sulfilimine salts and free&#8208;NH sulfoximines has been reported. Its generality was evidenced using a broad substrate scope along with late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex, biologically relevant substrates including a notorious amatoxin. DPPH was also shown to iminate sulfoxides with high yields under Rh catalysis to afford sulfoximines.







Abstract
Sulfilimines, as potential aza&#8208;isosteres of sulfoxides, are valued as building blocks, auxiliaries, ligands, bioconjugation handles, and as precursors to versatile S(VI) scaffolds including sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Here, we report a thioether imination methodology that exploits O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine (DPPH). Under mild, metal&#8208;free, and biomolecule&#8208;compatible conditions, DPPH enables late&#8208;stage S&#8208;imination on peptides, natural products, and a clinically trialled drug, and shows both excellent chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. This methodological report is extended to an efficient and high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot reaction for accessing free&#8208;NH sulfoximines with diverse substrates including ones of potential clinical importance. In the presence of a rhodium catalyst, sulfoxides are S&#8208;iminated in higher yields to afford free&#8208;NH sulfoximines. S&#8208;imination was validated on an oxidatively delicate amatoxin to give sulfilimine and sulfoximine congeners. Interestingly, these new sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;amatoxins show cytotoxicity. This method is further extended to create sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;Fulvestrant and buthionine analogues.

Rapid access of diverse polysubstituted 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with easily accessible nitrones.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized multifunctionalized 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which are considered potential bioisosteres for meta&#8208;substituted arenes, through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with nitrones. This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.

This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Anchor Peptide LCI with a Cobalt Cofactor Enhances Oxidation Efficiency of Polystyrene Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C with a flexible cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L2 hydroxylated polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. The oxidation using biohybrid catalyst (Co&#8208;L2@LCI_F16C) showed 15 times higher functionalization level than using the free cobalt cofactors.







Abstract
A typical component of polymer waste is polystyrene (PS) used in numerous applications, but degraded only slowly in the environment due to its hydrophobic properties. To increase the reactivity of polystyrene, polar groups need to be introduced. Here, biohybrid catalysts based on the engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C are presented, which are capable of attaching to polystyrene microparticles and hydroxylating benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. LCI peptides achieve a dense surface coverage of PS through monolayer formation within minutes in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature. The catalytically active cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L1 or Co&#8208;L2 with a modified NNNN macrocyclic TACD ligand (TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane) is covalently bound to the anchor peptide LCI through a maleimide linker. Compared to the free cofactors, a 12&#8208; to 15&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity using biohybrid catalysts based on LCI_F16C was observed.

         <title>Selective C&#8722;H Halogenation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase AetF halogenates a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity, and AetF and homologues of this enzyme also halogenate terminal alkynes. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis, and mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects provide insight into the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.







Abstract
Single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) possess both flavin reductase and FDH activity in a single enzyme. We recently reported that the single component FDH AetF catalyzes site&#8208;selective bromination and iodination of a variety of aromatic substrates and enantioselective bromolactonization and iodoetherification of styrenes bearing pendant carboxylic acid or alcohol substituents. Given this inherent reactivity and selectivity, we explored the utility of AetF as catalyst for alkene and alkyne C&#8722;H halogenation. We find that AetF catalyzes halogenation of a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity. Despite the utility of haloalkenes for cross&#8208;coupling and other applications, accessing these compounds in a stereoselective manner typically requires functional group interconversion processes, and selective halogenation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted olefins remains rare. We also establish that AetF and homologues of this enzyme can halogenate terminal alkynes. Mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects are used to support a mechanistic proposal involving covalent catalysis for halogenation of unactivated alkynes by AetF homologues. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis and continue to show the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.

         <title>Engineering Hydroxylase Activity, Selectivity, and Stability for a Scalable Concise Synthesis of a Key Intermediate to Belzutifan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxidations, but their practical use is limited by substrate scope and stability. We engineered an &#945;KGD to hydroxylate a non&#8208;native substrate with total turnovers exceeding those of reported &#945;KGDs. The engineered &#945;KGD enabled direct synthesis of a hydroxy&#8208;indanone to replace the previous five step synthesis en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan.







Abstract
Biocatalytic oxidations are an emerging technology for selective C&#8722;H bond activation. While promising for a range of selective oxidations, practical use of enzymes catalyzing aerobic hydroxylation is presently limited by their substrate scope and stability under industrially relevant conditions. Here, we report the engineering and practical application of a non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase for the direct stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroxylation of a non&#8208;native fluoroindanone en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan, replacing a five&#8208;step chemical synthesis with a direct enantioselective hydroxylation. Mechanistic studies indicated that formation of the desired product was limited by enzyme stability and product overoxidation, with these properties subsequently improved by directed evolution, yielding a biocatalyst capable of &gt;15,000 total turnovers. Highlighting the industrial utility of this biocatalyst, the high&#8208;yielding, green, and efficient oxidation was demonstrated at kilogram scale for the synthesis of belzutifan.

         <title>A Straightforward Method for the Generation of Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen with a Partially Negative Line</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conditions under which orthohydrogen with a unique Partial Negative Line (PNL) can be observed were determined by one of the essential Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) hyperpolarization methods, called Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). A transient species exists during the preliminary SABRE activation processes, and is responsible for the generation of PNL.







Abstract
The hydrogen molecule, which exists in two spin isomers (ortho&#8208; and parahydrogen), is a highly studied system due to its fundamental properties and practical applications. Parahydrogen is used for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance signal enhancement, which is hyperpolarization of other molecules, including biorelevant ones. Hyperpolarization can be achieved by using Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). SABRE can also convert parahydrogen into orthohydrogen, and surprisingly, in some cases, it has been discovered that orthohydrogen's resonance has the Partially Negative Line (PNL) pattern. Here, an approach for obtaining orthohydrogen with a PNL signal is presented for two catalysts: Ir&#8722;IMes, and Ir&#8722;IMesBn. The type of solvent in which SABRE is conducted is crucial for the observation of PNL. Specifically, a PNL signal can be easily generated in benzene using both catalysts, but it is more intense for Ir&#8722;IMesBn. In acetone, PNL is observed only for Ir&#8722;IMesBn. In methanol, no PNL is detected. The PNL effect is only detectable during the initial steps of pre&#8208;catalyst activation, and disappears as the activation process progresses. We have proposed a working hypothesis that explains our results. The presented data may facilitate the further investigation of PNL and its applications in material science and catalysis.

         <title>Axial&#8211;Equatorial Halide Ordering in Layered Hybrid Perovskites from Isotropic&#8211;Anisotropic 207Pb NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodide preferentially occupies the axial sites in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 2D perovskites. This results in a larger, more negative, 207Pb chemical shift anisotropy that can be distinguished in the isotropic&#8211;anisotropic 207Pb NMR correlation spectra.







Abstract
Bandgap&#8208;tuneable mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites are of interest for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, but suffer from photoinduced spatial halide segregation. Mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites are more resistant to halide segregation and are promising coatings for 3D perovskite solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;Iodide preferentially occupies the axial sites in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 2D perovskites. This results in a larger, more negative, &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb chemical shift anisotropy that can be distinguished in the isotropic&#8211;anisotropic &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb NMR correlation spectra.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandgap-tuneable mixed-halide 3D perovskites are of interest for multi-junction solar cells, but suffer from photoinduced spatial halide segregation. Mixed-halide 2D perovskites are more resistant to halide segregation and are promising coatings for 3D perovskite solar cells. The properties of mixed-halide compositions depend on the local halide distribution, which is challenging to study at the level of single octahedra. In particular, it has been suggested that there is a preference for occupation of the distinct axial and equatorial halide sites in mixed-halide 2D perovskites. &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb NMR can be used to probe the atomic-scale structure of lead-halide materials, but although the isotropic &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb shift is sensitive to halide stoichiometry, it cannot distinguish configurational isomers. Here, we use 2D isotropic&#8211;anisotropic correlation &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb NMR and relativistic DFT calculations to distinguish the [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] configurations in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 3D FAPb(Br&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Boundary&#8208;Rich Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts with Manganese(II)&#8208;Coordinated Active Environment for Selective Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;supported manganese&#8208;centered boundary&#8208;rich electrocatalysts show high activity for selective H2O2 synthesis. The secondary epoxide and hydroxyl groups surrounding Mn&#8722;N3&#8722;O sites and the O2 enrichment in the curved boundaries together contribute to the activity enhancement for the targeted electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Coordinated manganese (Mn) electrocatalysts owing to their electronic structure flexibility, non&#8208;toxic and earth abundant features are promising for electrocatalytic reactions. However, achieving selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production through two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208;ORR) is a challenge on Mn&#8208;centered catalysts. Targeting this goal, we report on the creation of a secondary Mn(II)&#8208;coordinated active environment with reactant enrichment effect on boundary&#8208;rich porous carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts, which facilitates the selective and rapid synthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8208;ORR. The catalysts exhibit nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and H2O2 productivity up to 15.1&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, representing the record high activity for Mn&#8208;based electrocatalyst in H2O2 electrosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that the epoxide and hydroxyl groups surrounding Mn(II) centers improve spin state by modifying electronic properties and charge transfer, thus tailoring the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate. Multiscale simulations reveal that the high&#8208;curvature boundaries facilitate oxygen (O2) adsorption and result in local O2 enrichment due to the enhanced interaction between carbon surface and O2. These merits together ensure the efficient formation of H2O2 with high local concentration, which can directly boost the tandem reaction of hydrolysis of benzonitrile to benzamide with nearly 100&#8201;% conversion rate and exclusive benzamide selectivity.

         <title>Mechanophotocatalysis: A Generalizable Approach to Solvent&#8208;minimized Photocatalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via the synergistic union with mechanochemistry, four archetypal photocatalysis reactions have been realized under solvent&#8208;free or solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. The mechanophotocatalytic versions feature competitive or superior efficiencies to the solution&#8208;state reactions, while also showcasing an enhanced tolerance to aerobic conditions.







Abstract
This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study cements the viability and generality of mechanophotocatalysis, merging mechanochemistry and photocatalysis to enable solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalytic reactions. We demonstrate the transmutation of four archetypal solution&#8208;state photocatalysis reactions to a solvent&#8208;minimized environment driven by the combined actions of milling, light, and photocatalysts. The chlorosulfonylation of alkenes and the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones were conducted under solvent&#8208;free conditions with competitive or superior efficiencies to their solution&#8208;state analogues. Furthermore, decarboxylative alkylations are shown to function efficiently under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, while the photoinduced energy transfer promoted [2+2] cycloaddition of chalcone experiences a significant initial rate enhancement over its solution&#8208;state variant. This work serves as a platform for future discoveries in an underexplored field: validating that solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalysis is not only generalizable and competitive with solution&#8208;state photocatalysis, but can also offer valuable advantages.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe for the High&#8208;Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Copper(II) Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that in vivo Cu2+ dynamics in the brain can be spatiotemporal visualized using the rational designed BBB&#8208;permeable ratiometric photoacoustic probe as the imaging agent. Taking advantages of high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging abilities of the probe, we have revealed the detailed alternations in Cu2+ levels in the Parkinson's disease mouse brain during both the disease progression and drug intervention at micron&#8208;resolution.







Abstract
Copper dysmetabolism is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, making high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging of Cu2+ in the brain essential for understanding the underlying pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, the current probes encounter obstacles in crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and providing high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution in deep tissues. Herein, we present a photoacoustic probe capable of imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain with high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution. The probe demonstrates selective ratiometric and reversible responses to Cu2+, while also efficiently crossing the BBB. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully visualized Cu2+ in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD) model mouse with a remarkable micron&#8208;level resolution. The imaging results revealed a significant increase in Cu2+ levels in the cerebral cortex as PD progresses, highlighting the close association between Cu2+ alternations in the region and the disease. We also demonstrated that the probe can be used to monitor changes in Cu2+ distribution in the PD model mouse brain during L&#8208;dopa intervention. Mechanism studies suggest that the copper dyshomeostasis in the PD mouse brain was dominated by the expression levels of divalent metal transporter 1. The application of our probe in imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain offers valuable insights into the copper&#8208;related molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>The Retaining Pse5Ac7Ac Pseudaminyltransferase KpsS1 Defines a Previously Unreported glycosyltransferase family (GT118)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pse5Ac7Ac glycosyltransferase (GT) activity has been demonstrated in characterisation of the retaining pseudaminyltransferase (PseT) KpsS1, the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118). KpsS1 is utilised in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of a glycoside terminating in Pse5Ac7Ac, an important bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid Neu5Ac.







Abstract
Cell surface sugar 5,7&#8208;diacetyl pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) is a bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid, Neu5Ac, and contributes to the virulence of a number of multidrug resistant bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite its discovery in the surface glycans of bacteria over thirty years ago, to date no glycosyltransferase enzymes (GTs) dedicated to the synthesis of a pseudaminic acid glycosidic linkage have been unequivocally characterised in vitro. Herein we demonstrate that A.&#8197;baumannii KpsS1 is a dedicated pseudaminyltransferase enzyme (PseT) which constructs a Pse5Ac7Ac&#8208;&#945;(2,6)&#8208;Glcp linkage, and proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. We utilise this PseT activity in tandem with the biosynthetic enzymes required for CMP&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac assembly, in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;linked Pse5Ac7Ac glycoside. Due to its unique activity and protein sequence, we also assign KpsS1 as the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118).

&lt;p&gt;Cell surface sugar 5,7-diacetyl pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) is a bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid, Neu5Ac, and contributes to the virulence of a number of multidrug resistant bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;. Despite its discovery in the surface glycans of bacteria over thirty years ago, to date no glycosyltransferase enzymes (GTs) dedicated to the synthesis of a pseudaminic acid glycosidic linkage have been unequivocally characterised in vitro. Herein we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; KpsS1 is a dedicated pseudaminyltransferase enzyme (PseT) which constructs a Pse5Ac7Ac-&#945;(2,6)-Glc&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; linkage, and proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. We utilise this PseT activity in tandem with the biosynthetic enzymes required for CMP-Pse5Ac7Ac assembly, in a two-pot, seven enzyme synthesis of an &#945;-linked Pse5Ac7Ac glycoside. Due to its unique activity and protein sequence, we also assign KpsS1 as the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting the &#960;&#8208;Acceptor Property of Mesoionic Carbenes by Carbonylation with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct room temperature dimerization of carbon monoxide by anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) has been reported to quantitatively yield (E)&#8208;ethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(olate) bridged mesoionic carbene (iMIC) lithium compounds, COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2. They undergo 2e&#8208;oxidation to afford 1,2&#8208;dione bridged bis iMIC, COon&#8208;(iMIC)2 containing compounds while redox neutral salt metatheses yield COen&#8208;[(iMIC)E]2 compounds (E=main group species).







Abstract
We report the room temperature dimerization of carbon monoxide mediated by C4/C5&#8208;vicinal anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (ADC = ArC{(Dipp)NC}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph, DMP (4&#8208;Me2NC6H4), Bp (4&#8208;PhC6H4)) to yield (E)&#8208;ethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(olate) (i.e. &#8722;O&#8722;C=C&#8722;O&#8722; = COen) bridged mesoionic carbene (iMIC) lithium compounds COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 (COen&#8208;[iMIC]2 = [ArC{(Dipp)NC}2(CO)]2) in quantitative yields. COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 are highly colored stable solids, exhibit a strikingly small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, and readily undergo 2e&#8208;oxidations with selenium, CuCl (or CuCl2), and AgCl to afford the dinuclear compounds COon&#8208;[(iMIC)E]2 (E = Se, CuCl, AgCl) featuring a 1,2&#8208;dione bridged neutral bis&#8208;iMIC (i.e. COon&#8208;[iMIC]2 = [ArC{(Dipp)NC}2(C=O)]2). COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 undergo redox&#8208;neutral salt metathesis reactions with LiAlH4 and (Et2O)2BeBr2 and afford COen&#8208;[(iMIC)AlH2]2 and COen&#8208;[(iMIC)BeBr]2, in which the dianionic COen&#8208;moiety remains intact. All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Stereoelectronic properties of COon&#8208;[iMIC]2 are quantified by experimental and theoretical methods.

         <title>Amphiphilic Covalent Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Pickering Emulsion Catalysis with Size Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed with highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were demonstrated to show a superior amphiphilicity for the formation of stable Pickering emulsions. Because of the high surface areas and tunable pore diameters of COFs, Pickering emulsion catalysis with both a high reaction efficiency and a remarkable size selectivity was achieved.







Abstract
Exploiting advanced amphiphilic solid catalysts is crucial to the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis. Herein, covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed with highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were found to show superior amphiphilicity and they were then developed as a new class of solid emulsifiers for Pickering emulsion catalysis. Employing amphiphilic COFs as solid emulsifiers, Pickering emulsions with controllable emulsion type and droplet sizes were obtained. COF materials have also been demonstrated to serve as porous surface coatings to replace traditional surface modifications for stabilizing Pickering emulsions. After implanting Pd nanoparticles into amphiphilic COFs, the obtained catalyst displayed a 3.9&#8197;times higher catalytic efficiency than traditional amphiphilic solid catalysts with surface modifications in the biphasic oxidation reaction of alcohols. Such an enhanced activity was resulted from the high surface area and regular porous structure of COFs. More importantly, because of their tunable pore diameters, Pickering emulsion catalysis with remarkable size selectivity was achieved. This work is the first example that COFs were applied in Pickering emulsion catalysis, providing a platform for exploring new frontiers of Pickering emulsion catalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of redox active ester and oxime esters was realized through electrochemical cathodic reduction. Mechanistic studies unveil a high&#8208;valent nickel species&#8208;driven reductive elimination pathway, rather than direct radical&#8208;radical coupling. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through a broad scope (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176; carboxylic acids) and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.







Abstract
A new electrochemical transformation is presented that enables chemists to couple simple alkyl carboxylic acid derivatives with an electrophilic amine reagent to construct C(sp3)&#8722;N bond. The success of this reaction hinges on the merging of cooperative electrochemical reduction with nickel catalysis. The chemistry exhibits a high degree of practicality, showcasing its wide applicability with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176; carboxylic acids and remarkable compatibility with diverse functional groups, even in the realm of late&#8208;stage functionalization. Furthermore, extensive mechanistic studies have unveiled the engagement of alkyl radicals and iminyl radicals; and elucidated the multifaceted roles played by iPr2O, Ni catalyst, and electricity.

         <title>Multivariate Machine Learning Models of Nanoscale Porosity from Ultrafast NMR Relaxometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning allows rapid classification and prediction of the surface area (SA) of nanoporous materials through NMR relaxometry measurements of solvent imbibed in the porous network. Here, principal component analysis (PCA) screens &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; SA materials, and partial least squares (PLS) provides numerical estimates of SA. This non&#8208;destructive technique can be used to help develop new materials with optimized porosity.







Abstract
Nanoporous materials are of great interest in many applications, such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage. The performance of these materials is closely related to their pore sizes, which are inefficient to determine through the conventional measurement of gas adsorption isotherms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry has emerged as a technique highly sensitive to porosity in such materials. Nonetheless, streamlined methods to estimate pore size from NMR relaxometry remain elusive. Previous attempts have been hindered by inverting a time domain signal to relaxation rate distribution, and dealing with resulting parameters that vary in number, location, and magnitude. Here we invoke well&#8208;established machine learning techniques to directly correlate time domain signals to BET surface areas for a set of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) imbibed with solvent at varied concentrations. We employ this series of MOFs to establish a correlation between NMR signal and surface area via partial least squares (PLS), following screening with principal component analysis, and apply the PLS model to predict surface area of various nanoporous materials. This approach offers a high&#8208;throughput, non&#8208;destructive way to assess porosity in c.a. one minute. We anticipate this work will contribute to the development of new materials with optimized pore sizes for various applications.

         <title>Synthesis of S(IV)&#8208;Stereogenic Chiral Thio&#8208;Oxazolidinones via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [3+2] Annulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations are disclosed, providing a modular platform for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones. Preliminary mechanistic studies are performed to rationalize the observed enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;controls.







Abstract
Organic molecules bearing chiral sulfur stereocenters exert a great impact on asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral drugs, and chiral materials. Compared with acyclic ones, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of thio&#8208;heterocycles has largely lagged behind due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Here we establish the first modular platform to access chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones via Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations of vinylethylene carbonates with sulfinylanilines. This protocol is featured by readily available starting materials, and high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. In particular, an unusual effect of a non&#8208;chiral supporting ligand on the diastereoselectivity was observed. Possible reaction mechanisms and stereocontrol models were proposed.

         <title>Probing a Major DNA Weakness: Resolving the Groove and Sequence Selectivity of the Diimine Complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Major changes&#8212;the crystallisation of a junction forming DNA decamer with &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+ shows three different sequence&#8208;selective binding modes, and displacement of Sr2+ from the minor groove to the interhelical space.







Abstract
The grooves of DNA provide recognition sites for many nucleic acid binding proteins and anticancer drugs such as the covalently binding cisplatin. Here we report a crystal structure showing, for the first time, groove selectivity by an intercalating ruthenium complex. The complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+, where phi=9,10&#8208;phenanthrenediimine, is bound to the DNA decamer duplex d(CCGGTACCGG)2. The structure shows that the metal complex is symmetrically bound in the major groove at the central TA/TA step, and asymmetrically bound in the minor groove at the adjacent GG/CC steps. A third type of binding links the strands, in which each terminal cytosine base stacks with one phen ligand. The overall binding stoichiometry is four Ru complexes per duplex. Complementary biophysical measurements confirm the binding preference for the &#923;&#8208;enantiomer and show a high affinity for TA/TA steps and, more generally, TA&#8208;rich sequences. A striking enantiospecific elevation of melting temperatures is found for oligonucleotides which include the TATA box sequence.

         <title>Pushing The Extreme of Multicentre Bonding: Planar Pentacoordinate Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar pentacoordinate hydride has been predicted for the first time in the global minimum C2V geometry of Li5H6&#8722; cluster.







Abstract
Planar hypercoordination has sparkled interest among the researchers from last few decades. Most of the elements in the Periodic Table have shown this remarkable structural feature. However, the smallest element, hydrogen, is missing in the list. No evidence is there in the literature. Herein, we introduce the first planar pentacoordinate hydrogen atom (ppH) in the global minimum geometry of Li5H6&#8722; cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is stabilized by multicentre bonding with five surrounding Li atoms. Natural charge analysis reveals that the central hydrogen is acting like a hydride which is strongly attracted by the positively charged surrounding lithium centres. The ppH structure is stabilized by strong electrostatic attraction as well as extensive multicentre bonding. Aromaticity has no role to play here. The cluster is dynamically stable and is expected to be detected in gas phase.

         <title>Enabling Stable and Low&#8208;Strain Lithium Plating/Stripping with 2D Layered Transition Metal Carbides by Forming Li&#8208;Zipped MXenes and a Li Halide&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;electrochemical scissor&#8221; and &#8220;Li zipper&#8221;&#8208;driven interlayer Li plating protocol in 2D layered transition metal carbides (MXenes) is proposed, where lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the bulk phase&#8208;structural stability, and a Li halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by &#8220;electrochemical scissor&#8221; removing the terminals of MXenes to maintain the stability and high Li+ diffusivity of SEI.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials demonstrate prominent advantage in regulating lithium plating/stripping behavior by confining lithium diffusion/plating within interlayer gaps. However, achieving effective interlayer confined lithium diffusion/plating without compromising the stability of bulk&#8208;structural and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) remains a considerable challenge. This paper presents an electrochemical scissor and lithium zipper&#8208;driven protocol for realizing interlayer confined lithium plating with pretty&#8208;low strain and volume change. In this protocol, lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the structural stability, and a lithium halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by electrochemically removing the terminals of halogenated MXenes to maintain the stability and rapid lithium ions diffusion of SEI. When the Ti3C2I2 serves as the host for lithium plating, the average coulomb efficiency exceeds 97.0&#8201;% after 320 lithium plating/stripping cycles in conventional ester electrolyte. Furthermore, a full cell comprising of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Ti3C2I2@Li exhibits a capacity retention rate of 73.4&#8201;% after 200 cycles even under high cathode mass&#8208;loading (20&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.4. Our findings advance the understanding of interlayer confined lithium plating in 2D layered materials and provide a new direction in regulating lithium and other metal plating/stripping behaviors.

         <title>Electrooxidative Rhodium(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Sulfoximines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrooxidative rhodium(III)/chiral carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes, is described. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.







Abstract
The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8722;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er). The practicality of this method is demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.

Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2-benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er). The practicality of this method is demonstrated by scale-up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Cellulose Nanocrystals Electrolyte Additive Enable Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anodes for Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reversible aqueous Zn battery was built by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The design of aqueous zinc (Zn) chemistry energy storage with high rate&#8208;capability and long serving life is a great challenge due to its inhospitable coordination environment and dismal interfacial chemistry. To bridge this big gap, herein, we build a highly reversible aqueous Zn battery by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions. As a result, the engineered electrolyte system achieves a superior average coulombic efficiency of 97.27&#8201;% under 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and steady charge&#8211;discharge for 982&#8197;h under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which proposes a universal pathway to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry in green, sustainable, and large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Functional Imaging Analysis of Engineered Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) analysis was developed for accurately visualizing tumors at cellular, tissue, and animal levels by enhancing metabolic differences. The strategy will potentially aid tumor identification, analysis, and surgical guidance.







Abstract
Functional imaging (FI) techniques have revolutionized tumor imaging by providing information on specific tumor functions, such as glycometabolism. However, tumor cells lack unique molecular characteristics at the molecular level and metabolic pathways, resulting in limited metabolic differences compared to normal cells and increased background signals from FI. To address this limitation, we developed a novel imaging technique termed proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) for accurate visualization of tumors. By using &#8220;two adjacent chemically labeled glycoproteins&#8221; as output signals, we significantly enhance the metabolic differences between tumor and normal cells by PEFI, thereby reducing the background signals for analysis and improving the accuracy of tumor functional imaging. Our results demonstrate that PEFI can accurately identify tumors at the cellular, tissue, and animal level, and has potential value in clinical identification and analysis of tumor cells and tissues, as well as in the guidance of clinical tumor resection surgery.

         <title>Flavin&#8208;N5OOH Functions as both a Powerful Nucleophile and a Base in the Superfamily of Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational study demonstrates that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH species can function as both powerful nucleophiles and bases in the superfamily of flavoenzymes, which can mediate many kinds of challenging non&#8208;redox reactions, such as the cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, Cl) bonds. The findings revive oxygen activation chemistry by flavoenzymes and are expected to spur the discovery of many other Flavin&#8208;N5OOH&#8208;dependent enzymes.







Abstract
Flavoenzymes can mediate a large variety of oxidation reactions through the activation of oxygen. However, the O2 activation chemistry of flavin enzymes is not yet fully exploited. Normally, the O2 activation occurs at the C4a site of the flavin cofactor, yielding the flavin C4a&#8208;(hydro)hydroperoxyl species in monooxygenases or oxidases. Using extensive MD simulations, QM/MM calculations and QM calculations, our studies reveal the formation of the common nucleophilic species, Flavin&#8208;N5OOH, in two distinct flavoenzymes (RutA and EncM). Our studies show that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH acts as a powerful nucleophile that promotes C&#8722;N cleavage of uracil in RutA, and a powerful base in the deprotonation of substrates in EncM. We reason that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH can be a common reactive species in the superfamily of flavoenzymes, which accomplish generally selective general base catalysis and C&#8722;X (X=N, S, Cl, O) cleavage reactions that are otherwise challenging with solvated hydroxide ion base. These results expand our understanding of the chemistry and catalysis of flavoenzymes.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;selective Carboxylation of Pyridines with CO2 via Pyridylphosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective carboxylation of pyridines with CO2 via pyridylphosphonium salts has been developed. The C&#8722;P bond carboxylation with CO2 was achieved for the first time. This work represents a novel mode of site&#8208;selective carboxylation of pyridines, which may be a useful approach in new drug design and discovery in the future.







Abstract
Pyridine motifs are widespread pharmacophores in many drugs. Installing various substituents through pyridine C&#8722;H bond functionalization is significant for new drug design and discovery. Developments of late&#8208;stage functionalization reactions enrich the strategies for selective functionalization of pyridines. However, late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines is a long&#8208;standing challenge, especially selectively carboxylation with CO2 on pyridine motifs. Herein, we describe a practical method for C4&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines via one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H phosphination and copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of the resulted phosphonium salts with CO2. The reaction is conducted under mild conditions and compatible with multiple active groups and several pyridine drugs, providing diverse valuable isonicotinic acid compounds, demonstrating the application potential of this strategy.

         <title>Harnessing Catalytic RNA Circuits for Construction of Artificial Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes an amplifiable RNA circuit based on the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 function, which can directly build regulatory connections between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells. With this design, artificial signaling pathways can be introduced into mammalian cells to control cellular responses and phenotypes through differentiated RNA expression.







Abstract
Engineering of genetic networks with artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) can reprogram cellular responses and phenotypes under different circumstances for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, construction of ASPs between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells is highly challenging. Here we report an amplifiable RNA circuit that can theoretically build regulatory connections between any endogenous genes in mammalian cells. We harness the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 function to transduce the signals from distinct messenger RNA expression of trigger genes into manipulation of target genes. Through introduction of these RNA&#8208;based genetic circuits, mammalian cells are endowed with autonomous capabilities to sense the changes of RNA expression either induced by ligand stimuli or from various cell types and control the cellular responses and fates via apoptosis&#8208;related ASPs. Our design provides a generalized platform for construction of ASPs inside the genetic networks of mammalian cells based on differentiated RNA expression.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Mono&#8208;N&#8208;Methylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines without the Requirement of External High&#8208;Hydrogen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables the selective synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines, including deuterium&#8208;labelled drugs. This innovative approach combines an earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalyst with a weak base, resulting in a practical and sustainable protocol for mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylation. By effectively inhibiting the formation of formamide byproducts, it eliminates the need for external high&#8208;pressure hydrogen.







Abstract
The synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines has traditionally been challenging, requiring noble metal catalysts and high&#8208;pressure H2 for achieving satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we developed an approach for the selective coupling of methanol and aliphatic primary amines, without high&#8208;pressure hydrogen, using a manganese&#8208;based catalyst. Remarkably, up to 98&#8201;% yields with broad substrate scope were achieved at low catalyst loadings. Notably, due to the weak base&#8208;catalyzed alcoholysis of formamide intermediates, our novel protocol not only obviates the addition of high&#8208;pressure H2 but also prevents side secondary N&#8208;methylation, supported by control experiments and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;Dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;Oxy Motif: Method Development and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Method development and total synthesis have resulted in the enantioselective synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif, and thus expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids), completed within 4&#8211;7 steps.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif is widely found in various types of bioactive natural products. However, present synthesis is mainly non&#8208;asymmetric which relied upon different olefination or transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions using enantioenriched precursors. Herein, based upon a newly developed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of conjugated polyenoic acids, a variety of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif (with E&#8208;configured internal olefin) was generated as the corresponding &#945;&#8208;adducts in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective manner. Utilizing 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif as key intermediates, we further demonstrated their synthetic potential by expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids) within 4&#8211;7 steps.

         <title>A Modular Turn&#8208;On Strategy to Profile E2&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination Events in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8722;E2&#8722;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, but the role of the central E2 has been largely overlooked. This work presents a new method, called targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2, or tCUbE, that can follow ubiquitin all the way through its cascade to report on E2 activity and interactions in living mammalian cells.







Abstract
A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8722;E2&#8722;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, which controls many different aspects of cellular signaling. The role of the E2 has been largely overlooked, despite influencing substrate identity, chain multiplicity, and topology. Here we report a method&#8212;targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2 (tCUbE)&#8212;that can track a tagged ubiquitin through its entire enzymatic cascade in living mammalian cells. We use this approach to reveal new targets whose ubiquitination depends on UbcH5a E2 activity. We demonstrate that tCUbE can be broadly applied to multiple E2s and in different human cell lines. tCUbE is uniquely suited to examine E2&#8722;E3&#8208;substrate cascades of interest and/or piece together previously unidentified cascades, thereby illuminating entire branches of the UPS and providing critical insight that will be useful for identifying new therapeutic targets in the UPS.

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Based Fully Non&#8208;fused Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor, GS70, is synthesized by incorporating 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as a &#960;&#8208;bridge, aiming to reduce material costs and enhance stability. The obtained active layers exhibit favorable morphology and effectively suppress charge recombination. Encouragingly, this design leads to the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and stable single&#8208;junction and parallel tandem OSCs.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are still suffering from the low light utilization and unstable under ultraviolet irradiation. To tackle these challenges, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;fused acceptor based on 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as &#960;&#8208;bridge unit, denoted as GS70, which serves as active layer in the front&#8208;cell for constructing tandem OSCs with a parallel configuration. Benefiting from the well&#8208;complementary absorption spectra with the rear&#8208;cell, GS70&#8208;based parallel tandem OSCs exhibit an improved photoelectron response over the range between 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm, yielding a high short&#8208;circuit current density of 28.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The improvement in light utilization translates to a power conversion efficiency of 19.4&#8201;%, the highest value among all parallel tandem OSCs. Notably, owing to the intrinsic stability of GS70, the manufactured parallel tandem OSCs retain 84.9&#8201;% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;hours. Overall, this work offers novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost and stability non&#8208;fused acceptors, emphasizing the importance of adopting a parallel tandem configuration for achieving efficient light harvesting and improved photostability in OSCs.

         <title>Controlling the Phase Transformation of Alumina for Enhanced Stability and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter.







Abstract
Current transition alumina catalysts require the presence of significant amounts of toxic, environmentally deleterious dopants for their stabilization. Herein, we report a simple and novel strategy to engineer transition aluminas to withstand aging temperatures up to 1200&#8201;&#176;C without inducing the transformation to low&#8208;surface&#8208;area &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and without requiring dopants. By judiciously optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter. These specific surface sites provide favorable interactions with supported metal catalysts, leading to improved metal dispersion and greatly enhanced catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation. The results presented herein not only provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the critical factors causing deactivation and phase transformation of aluminas but also pave the way for the development of catalysts with improved activity for catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation.

The results presented herein not only provide molecular-level insights into the critical factors causing deactivation and phase transformation of aluminas but also pave the way for the development of catalysts with improved activity for catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Oxidation in Aqueous Microdroplets: Water Radical Cation as Primary Oxidizing Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous oxidation in aqueous microdroplets has led to controversy as to the identity of the oxidants. This minireview summarizes unique features of microdroplets, proposing water radical cation&#8208;driven reactions that reconcile different interpretations of the experimental results.







Abstract
Exploration of the unique chemical properties of interfaces can unlock new understanding. A striking example is the finding of accelerated reactions, particularly spontaneous oxidation reactions, that occur without assistance of catalysts or external oxidants at the air interface of both aqueous and organic solutions (provided they contain some water). This finding opened a new area of interfacial chemistry but also caused heated debate regarding the primary chemical species responsible for the observed oxidation. An overview of the literature covering oxidation in microdroplets with air interfaces is provided, together with a critical examination of previous findings and hypotheses. The water radical cation/radical anion pair, formed spontaneously and responsible for the electric field at or near the droplet/air interface, is suggested to constitute the primary redox species. Mechanisms of accelerated microdroplet reactions are critically discussed and it is shown that hydroxyl radical/hydrogen peroxide formation in microdroplets does not require that these species be the primary oxidant. Instead, we suggest that hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide are the products of water radical cation decay in water. The importance of microdroplet chemistry in the prebiotic environment is sketched briefly and the role of partial solvation in reaction acceleration is noted.

         <title>Designing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Membranes for Isomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To well separate pairs of hydrocarbon isomers, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed. Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 membranes are fabricated for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes with middle pore size are constructed for n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation. Additionally, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smallest pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based separation has the merit of low carbon footprint. In this study, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed for discriminating various pairs of hydrocarbon isomers. Specifically, Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo) membranes are developed for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. For n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation, the functional groups and proportion of the ligands in UiO&#8208;66 are gradually adjusted to effectively regulate the pore size, and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes are constructed. In addition, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smaller pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.

         <title>Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6): A Multi&#8208;Chromophore Chalcogenide with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Property Designed by Group Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) was designed and synthesized using the &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy. Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a large SHG (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap of 2.45&#8197;eV, a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm), a broad IR transparent region (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m) as well as the congruent&#8208;melting behavior, which indicate that it is a promising IR NLO material.







Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar materials capable of exhibiting many important functional properties are indispensable for electro&#8208;optical technologies, yet their rational structural design remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy for designing the first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6), that crystallizes in a NCS and polar space group of Cm. The structure features a unique basic building unit (BBU) [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)], formed through &#8220;grafting [In4Se10] supertetrahedra on the root of [In(P2Se6)2] groups&#8221;. Theoretical calculations confirm that this [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)] BBU can achieve a &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; combination of properties from two chromophores, [In4Se10] supertetrahedron and ethane&#8208;like [P2Se6] dimer. That makes Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a large band gap (2.45&#8197;eV), broad infrared (IR) transmission (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m), a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm) as well as the congruently&#8208;melting property at ~700&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) will be a promising NLO crystal, especially in the IR region, and this research also demonstrates that &#8220;group grafting&#8221; will be an effective strategy for constructing novel polar BBUs with multi&#8208;chromophore to design NCS structures and high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric with Afterglow Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enable a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature (&#916;TC=114.4&#8197;K), but also realize the first integration of notable ferroelectricity and long afterglow emission in (4&#8208;methylpiperidium)CdCl3 with one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite architecture.







Abstract
Luminescent ferroelectrics are holding exciting prospect for integrated photoelectronic devices due to potential light&#8208;polarization interactions at electron scale. Integrating ferroelectricity and long&#8208;lived afterglow emission in a single material would offer new possibilities for fundamental research and applications, however, related reports have been a blank to date. For the first time, we here achieved the combination of notable ferroelectricity and afterglow emission in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material. Remarkably, the presented (4&#8208;methylpiperidium)CdCl3 also shows noticeable antiferroelectric behavior. The implementation of cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enables a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 114.4&#8197;K but also brings a record longest emission lifetime up to 117.11&#8197;ms under ambient conditions, realizing a leapfrog improvement of at least two orders of magnitude compared to reported hybrid ferroelectrics so far. This finding would herald the emergence of novel application potential, such as multi&#8208;level density data storage or multifunctional sensors, towards the future integrated optoelectronic devices with multitasking capabilities.

         <title>Dynamically Ion&#8208;Coordinated Bipolar Organodichalcogenide Cathodes Enabling High&#8208;Energy and Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new b&#8208;type phenyl diselenide cathode with self&#8208;healing diselenide bond active site is developed, showing evident superiority to conventional b&#8208;type organic cathodes with organic active groups in terms of redox potential and reversible capacity. During charge/discharge processes, the diselenide bond is periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with cation/anion charge carriers, enabling a high&#8208;energy and durable aqueous Zn battery.







Abstract
Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high&#8208;energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high&#8208;voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion&#8208;coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe&#8208;SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)&#8722; to (PhSe&#8208;SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF&#8722;). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK&#8208;3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK&#8208;3&#8201;||&#8201;Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPDSe&#8722;1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4&#8197;V), high energy density (578.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgPDSe&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (12&#8201;000 cycles) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion&#8208;type active site engineering for high&#8208;voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high&#8208;energy AZBs.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Porous Fullerene Membranes for Ultimate Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with high chemical stability have attracted intensive interest in membrane design for the separation of organic solvents. As a novel 2D material, polymeric fullerenes (C60)&#8734; with distinctive properties are very promising for the development of innovative membranes. In this work, we report the construction of a 2D (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane for organic solvent separation. The pathways of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane are constructed by sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm lateral channels and nanoscale in&#8208;plane pores created by the depolymerization of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheets. Attributing to ordered and shortened transport pathways, the ultrathin porous (C60)&#8734; membrane is superior in organic solvent separation. The hexane, acetone, and methanol fluxes are up to 1146.3&#177;53, 900.4&#177;41, and 879.5&#177;42 kg&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1, respectively, which are up to 130 times higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes with similar dye rejection. Our findings demonstrate the prospect of 2D (C60)&#8734; as a promising nanofiltration membrane in the separation of organic solvents from macromolecular compounds such as dyes, drugs, hormones, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective and Efficient Perdeuteration of n&#8208;Pentane via H/D Exchange Catalyzed by a Silica&#8208;Supported Hafnium&#8208;Iridium Bimetallic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach is used to prepare a novel hafnium&#8208;iridium catalyst immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, featuring well&#8208;defined [&#8801;SiOHf(CH2tBu)2(&#956;&#8208;H)3IrCp*] surface sites. Unlike the monometallic analogous materials Hf/SiO2 and Ir/SiO2, which promote n&#8208;pentane deuterogenolysis through C&#8208;C bond scission, we demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions (1 bar D2, 250&#176;C, 3h, 0.5 mol%), the heterobimetallic catalyst HfIr/SiO2 is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis (&lt;2% at 95% conversion). Furthermore this HfIr/SiO2 catalyst is robust and can be re&#8208;used several times without evidence of decomposition. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectron Migration Boosted by Hollow Double&#8208;Shell Dyads Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen production based on noble metal&#8208;free systems is a promising technology for the conversion of solar energy into green hydrogen, it is pivotal and challenging to tailor&#8208;make photocatalysts for achieving high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we reported a hollow double&#8208;shell dyad through uniformly coating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the surface of hollow Co9S8. The double shell architecture enhances the scattering and refraction efficiency of incident light, shortens the transmission distance of the photogenerated charge carriers, and exposes more active sites for photocatalytic conversion. The hydrogen evolution rate is as high as 23.15 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is significantly enhanced when compared with that of their physical mixture (0.30 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) and Pt&#8208;based counterpart (11.84 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). This work provides a rational approach to the construction of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems based on COFs to enhance hydrogen evolution performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell Membrane as&#160;A Promising Therapeutic Target: From Materials Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cell membrane is a crucial component of cells, protecting their integrity and stability while facilitating signal transduction and information exchange. Therefore, disrupting its structure or impairing its functions can potentially cause irreversible cell damage. Presently, the tumor cell membrane is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for various treatment methods. Given the extensive research focused on cell membranes, it is both necessary and timely to discuss these developments, from materials design to specific biomedical applications. This review covers treatments based on functional materials targeting the cell membrane, ranging from well&#8208;known  membrane&#8208;anchoring photodynamic therapy to recent lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation. The diverse therapeutic mechanisms are introduced in the following sections: membrane&#8208;anchoring phototherapy, self&#8208;assembly on the membrane, in situ biosynthesis on the membrane, and degradation of cell membrane proteins by chimeras. In each section, we outline the conceptual design or general structure derived from numerous studies, emphasizing representative examples to understand advancements and draw inspiration. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future directions in membrane&#8208;targeted therapy from our perspective. This review aims to engage multidisciplinary readers and encourage researchers in related fields to advance the fundamental theories and practical applications of membrane&#8208;targeting therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of a Polyketide Synthase Module after C&#8722;C Bond Formation Reveals Transient Acyl Carrier Domain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are complex molecular assembly lines generating diverse biologically active compounds. Cryo&#8208;EM, NMR spectroscopy, XL&#8208;MS, and modeling shed light on productive interactions of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) with its ketosynthase (KS) domain. The 2.84&#8197;&#197; structure of a chain&#8208;branching rhizoxin PKS module trapped after C&#8722;C bond formation provides an important reference point in the dynamics of these versatile megasynthases.







Abstract
Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are giant assembly lines that produce an impressive range of biologically active compounds. However, our understanding of the structural dynamics of these megasynthases, specifically the delivery of acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound building blocks to the catalytic site of the ketosynthase (KS) domain, remains severely limited. Using a multipronged structural approach, we report details of the inter&#8208;domain interactions after C&#8722;C bond formation in a chain&#8208;branching module of the rhizoxin PKS. Mechanism&#8208;based crosslinking of an engineered module was achieved using a synthetic substrate surrogate that serves as a Michael acceptor.

     alt="Trapping of a Polyketide Synthase Module after C&#8722;C Bond Formation Reveals Transient Acyl Carrier Domain Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are complex molecular assembly lines generating diverse biologically active compounds. Cryo-EM, NMR spectroscopy, XL-MS, and modeling shed light on productive interactions of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) with its ketosynthase (KS) domain. The 2.84&#8197;&#197; structure of a chain-branching rhizoxin PKS module trapped after C&#8722;C bond formation provides an important reference point in the dynamics of these versatile megasynthases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are giant assembly lines that produce an impressive range of biologically active compounds. However, our understanding of the structural dynamics of these megasynthases, specifically the delivery of acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound building blocks to the catalytic site of the ketosynthase (KS) domain, remains severely limited. Using a multipronged structural approach, we report details of the inter-domain interactions after C&#8722;C bond formation in a chain-branching module of the rhizoxin PKS. Mechanism-based crosslinking of an engineered module was achieved using a synthetic substrate surrogate that serves as a Michael acceptor. The crosslinked protein allowed us to identify an asymmetric state of the dimeric protein complex upon C&#8722;C bond formation by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The possible existence of two ACP binding sites, one of them a potential &#8220;parking position&#8221; for substrate loading, was also indicated by AlphaFold2 predictions. NMR spectroscopy showed that a transient complex is formed in solution, independent of the linker domains, and photochemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry of the standalone domains allowed us to pinpoint the interdomain interaction sites. The structural insights into a branching PKS module arrested after C&#8722;C bond formation allows a better understanding of domain dynamics and provides valuable information for the rational design of modular assembly lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of L&#8208;RNA Aptamer&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Efficient Cell Uptake and G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;Mediated Gene Control</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a novel strategy for transporting L&#8208;RNA aptamers that target rG4s into the cytosol using cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). Polyarginine residues (R8) were covalently attached to the L&#8208;aptamer by click chemistry and the first L&#8208;RNA aptamer&#8208;CPP conjugate (Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c) was generated. Our study demonstrates that Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c functions as an effective tool for regulating rG4&#8208;mediated gene expression.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (D&#8208;rG4s) are prevalent in the transcriptome and play crucial regulatory roles in various biological processes. Recently, L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been reported to recognize functional rG4s with a strong binding affinity and specificity. However, owing to the poor cell penetration capacity of L&#8208;RNA aptamers, their biological applications are currently limited. Herein, we rationally design an L&#8208;RNA aptamer&#8208;peptide conjugate, Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c, which can efficiently translocate into the cytosol and target the rG4 of interest. Notably, we demonstrate diverse regulatory roles of Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c on rG4 motif present in different regions of mRNAs and further expand the application in different cell lines. Our novel and biocompatible conjugate enhances the cellular uptake of the L&#8208;RNA aptamer, and our robust strategy enables non&#8208;canonical RNA structures to be targeted by L&#8208;RNA aptamers for gene control in cells.

         <title>Generation of a Hydrophobic Protrusion on Nanoparticles to Improve the Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Ability and Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable hydrophobic protrusion was created on Janus particles to regulate the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interactions. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, lead the particle to dock to the membrane, and then draw the whole particle into the cell, improving the efficiencies of both membrane&#8208;anchoring and cellular internalization.







Abstract
Controlling the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction to achieve easy and fast membrane anchoring and cellular internalization is of great importance in a variety of biomedical applications. Here we report a simple and versatile strategy to maneuver the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction by creating a tunable hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles through swelling&#8208;induced symmetry breaking. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, leading the particles to docking to the membrane, followed by drawing the whole particles into the cell. The efficiencies of both membrane anchoring and cellular internalization can be promoted by optimizing the size of the protrusion. In vitro, the Janus particles can quickly anchor to the cell membrane in 1&#8197;h and be internalized within 24&#8197;h, regardless of the types of cells involved. In vivo, the Janus particles can effectively anchor to the brain and skin tissues to provide a high retention in these tissues after intracerebroventricular, intrahippocampal, or subcutaneous injection. This strategy involving the creation of a hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles to tune the cell&#8208;membrane interaction holds great potential in nanoparticle&#8208;based biomedical applications.

         <title>Stabilizing Sulfur Sites in Tetraoxygen Tetrahedral Coordination Structure for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetraoxygen tetrahedral coordination structure (S&#8208;O4) inside NiO is produced by encapsulating S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl&#8208;type oxide. This unique structure could trigger a S&#8208;promoted lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (SLOM) during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which greatly elevated the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Ion regulation strategy is regarded as a promising pathway for designing transition metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with improved activity and stability. Precise anion conditioning can accurately change the anionic environment so that the acid radical ions (SO42&#8722;, PO32&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, etc.), regardless of their state (inside the catalyst, on the catalyst surface, or in the electrolyte), can optimize the electronic structure of the cationic active site and further increase the catalytic activity. Herein, we report a new approach to encapsulate S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl&#8208;type oxide NiO to form a tetraoxo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination structure (S&#8208;O4) inside the NiO (S&#8208;NiO&#8201;&#8208;I). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando vibrational spectroscopy proves that this kind of unique structure could achieve the S&#8208;O4 and Ni&#8208;S stable structure in S&#8208;NiO&#8208;I. Combining mass spectroscopy characterization, it could be confirmed that the S&#8208;O4 structure is the key factor for triggering the lattice oxygen exchange to participate in the OER process. This work demonstrates that the formation of tetraoxygen tetrahedral structure is a generalized key for boosting the OER performances of transition metal oxides.

         <title>L&#8208;Glycosidase&#8208;Cleavable Natural Glycans Facilitate the Chemical Synthesis of Correctly Folded Disulfide&#8208;Bonded D&#8208;Proteins</title>

Temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto D&#8208;serine (DS) or D&#8208;threonine (DT) residues of synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase (L&#8208;OGA) to afford the desired D&#8208;protein targets.







Abstract
D&#8208;peptide ligands can be screened for therapeutic potency and enzymatic stability using synthetic mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins), but efficient acquisition of these D&#8208;proteins can be hampered by the need to accomplish their in vitro folding, which often requires the formation of correctly linked disulfide bonds. Here, we report the finding that temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto selected D&#8208;serine or D&#8208;threonine residues of the synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and that the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins to afford the desired chirally inverted D&#8208;protein targets using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase. This approach enabled the efficient chemical syntheses of several important but difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold D&#8208;proteins incorporating disulfide bonds including the mirror&#8208;image tumor necrosis factor alpha (D&#8208;TNF&#945;) homotrimer and the mirror&#8208;image receptor&#8208;binding domain of the Omicron spike protein (D&#8208;RBD). Our work establishes the use of O&#8208;GlcNAc to facilitate D&#8208;protein synthesis and folding and proves that D&#8208;proteins bearing O&#8208;GlcNAc can be good substrates for naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase.

Here, we report the finding that temporary installation of natural O-linked-&#946;-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) groups onto selected D-serine or D-threonine residues of the synthetic disulfide-bonded D-proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and that the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D-proteins to afford the desired chirally inverted D-protein targets using naturally occurring O-GlcNAcase. This approach enabled the efficient chemical syntheses of several important but difficult-to-fold D-proteins incorporating disulfide bonds including the mirror-image tumor necrosis factor alpha (D-TNF&#945;) homotrimer and the mirror-image receptor-binding domain of the Omicron spike protein (D-RBD). Our work establishes the use of O-GlcNAc to facilitate D-protein synthesis and folding and proves that D-proteins bearing O-GlcNAc can be good substrates for naturally occurring O-GlcNAcase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Sulfur&#8208;Doped Copper Catalyst with Efficient Electrocatalytic Formate Generation during the Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A S&#8208;doped&#8208;Cu catalyst excluding post&#8208;transition metal was shown to exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This owes to the plenary grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds in CuS after electrolysis, while the latter factor can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates to further improve the activity.







Abstract
Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals has struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ex situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8722;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic element (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.

         <title>Perovskite Single Crystals with Self&#8208;Cleaning Surface for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface contamination issue of solution&#8208;grown perovskite single crystals is addressed by the self&#8208;cleaning effect induced by an amphiphilic molecule, which leads to improved crystal properties and a record efficiency of 23.4&#8201;% for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells. Moreover, this strategy applies to perovskite single crystals with different morphologies and compositions, which can contribute to improve other optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite single crystals are promising for diverse optoelectronic applications. As a universal issue of solution&#8208;grown perovskite single crystals, surface contamination causes adverse effect on material properties and device performance. Herein, learning from the self&#8208;cleaning effect of lotus leaf, we address the surface contamination issue by introducing an amphiphilic long&#8208;chain organic amine into the perovskite crystal growth solution. Self&#8208;assembly of CTAC provides a hydrophobic crystal surface, inducing spontaneous removal of residual growth solution, which results in clean surface and better optoelectronic properties of perovskite single crystals. An impressive efficiency of 23.4&#8201;% is obtained, setting a new record for FAxMA1&#8208;xPbI3 single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Moreover, our strategy also applies to perovskite single crystals with different morphology and composition, which may contribute to improvement of other single&#8208;crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Phase Control and Singlet Energy Transfer Enabled by Trimethylamine Modified Boron Dipyrromethene for Stable CsPbBr3 Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) driven can precisely control phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 quantum wells. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA, acting as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity, facilitates efficient singlet energy transfer (ET) and tailors the luminescent characteristics to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control.







Abstract
The phase distribution and organic spacer cations play pivotal roles in determining the emission performance and stability of perovskite quantum wells (QWs). Here, we propose a universal molecular regulation strategy to tailor phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 QWs. The capability of sterically hindered ligands with formidable surface binding groups is underscored in directing CsPbBr3 growth and refining phase distribution. With trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) ligand as a representative, the BDP&#8208;TMA driven can precisely control phase distribution and passivate defects of CsPbBr3. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA acts as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity in obtained BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3, facilitating efficient singlet energy transfer and tailoring the luminescence to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. The BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 demonstrates significant phase stability under water exposure, light irradiation, and moderate temperature. Interestingly, BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control at elevated temperatures, which can be achieved feasible for advanced information encryption. This discovery paves the way for the exploration of perovskite QWs in applications like temperature sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other advanced optical smart technologies.

         <title>Microbubble Biointerfacing by Regulation of the Platelet Membrane Surfactant Activity at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface for Acute Thrombosis Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbubbles can be biointerfaced by rationally regulating the platelet membrane surfactant activity at the gas&#8208;liquid interface. The protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratios (P&#8201;:&#8201;L ratios) of the platelet membranes are reduced to stabilize the platesome microbubbles (PMBs). The activated conformation of &#945;IIb&#946;3 grants PMBs the ability for molecular ultrasound diagnosis of acute thrombosis.







Abstract
Biointerfacing nanomaterials with cell membranes has been successful in the functionalization of nanoparticles or nanovesicles, but microbubble functionalization remains challenging due to the unique conformation of the lipid monolayer structure at the gas&#8208;liquid interface that provides insufficient surfactant activity. Here, we describe a strategy to rationally regulate the surfactant activity of platelet membrane vesicles by adjusting the ratio of proteins to lipids through fusion with synthetic phospholipids (i.e., liposomes). A &#8220;platesome&#8221; with the optimized protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio can be assembled at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in the same manner as pulmonary surfactants to stabilize a microsized gas bubble. Platesome microbubbles (PMBs) inherited 61.4&#8201;% of the platelet membrane vesicle proteins and maintained the active conformation of integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 without the talin&#8197;1 for fibrin binding. We demonstrated that the PMBs had good stability, long circulation, and superior functionality both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by molecular ultrasound imaging, the PMBs provide up to 11.8&#8197;dB of ultrasound signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement for discriminating between acute and chronic thrombi. This surface tension regulating strategy may provide a paradigm for biointerfacing microbubbles with cell membranes, offering a potential new approach for the construction of molecular ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of different diseases.

         <title>Strikingly High Activity of 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase Towards Di&#8208;Polyunsaturated Arachidonoyl/Adrenoyl&#8208;Phosphatidylethanolamines Generates Peroxidation Signals of Ferroptotic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly polyunsaturated phospholipids are present in biomembranes, albeit at very low abundancies. Their specific function is not known. We discovered that 15&#8208;lipoxygenase catalyzes oxygenation of these phospholipids at the same high rate as free fatty acids and yield 15&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;products which act as pro&#8208;ferroptotic signals of cell death.







Abstract
The vast majority of membrane phospholipids (PLs) include two asymmetrically positioned fatty acyls: oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) attached predominantly at the sn2 position, and non&#8208;oxidizable saturated/monounsaturated acids (SFA/MUFA) localized at the sn1 position. The peroxidation of PUFA&#8208;PLs, particularly sn2&#8208;arachidonoyl(AA)&#8208; and sn2&#8208;adrenoyl(AdA)&#8208;containing phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), has been associated with the execution of ferroptosis, a program of regulated cell death. There is a minor subpopulation (&#8776;1&#8211;2&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of doubly PUFA&#8208;acylated phospholipids (di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PLs) whose role in ferroptosis remains enigmatic. Here we report that 15&#8208;lipoxygenase (15LOX) exhibits unexpectedly high pro&#8208;ferroptotic peroxidation activity towards di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs. We revealed that peroxidation of several molecular species of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs occurred early in ferroptosis. Ferrostatin&#8208;1, a typical ferroptosis inhibitor, effectively prevented peroxidation of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs. Furthermore, co&#8208;incubation of cells with di&#8208;AA&#8208;PE and 15LOX produced PUFA&#8208;PE peroxidation and induced ferroptotic death. The decreased contents of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs in ACSL4 KO A375 cells was associated with lower levels of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PE peroxidation and enhanced resistance to ferroptosis. Thus, di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PE species are newly identified phospholipid peroxidation substrates and regulators of ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic target for many diseases related to ferroptotic death.

         <title>Reshaping Echinocandin Antifungal Drugs To Circumvent Glucan Synthase Point&#8208;Mutation&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A docking&#8208;based model elucidates how echinocandins form a ternary complex with their glucan synthase target and associated membrane lipids. Removing hemiaminal alcohol from echinocandins reduced, and benzylic dehydroxylation improved potency against echinocandin&#8208;resistant yeast. Candida strains exposed to rezafungin or its dehydroxylated derivative, RZF&#8208;1, evolved resistance, with RZF&#8208;1 showing significantly higher potency against these strains.







Abstract
Echinocandins are a class of antifungal drugs that inhibit the activity of the &#946;&#8208;(1,3)&#8208;glucan synthase complex, which synthesizes fungal cell wall &#946;&#8208;(1,3)&#8208;glucan. Echinocandin resistance is linked to mutations in the FKS gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the glucan synthase complex. We present a molecular&#8208;docking&#8208;based model that provides insight into how echinocandins interact with the target Fks protein: echinocandins form a ternary complex with both Fks and membrane lipids. We used reductive dehydration of alcohols to generate dehydroxylated echinocandin derivatives and evaluated their potency against a panel of Candida pathogens constructed by introducing resistance&#8208;conferring mutations in the FKS gene. We found that removing the hemiaminal alcohol, which drives significant conformational alterations in the modified echinocandins, reduced their efficacy. Conversely, eliminating the benzylic alcohol of echinocandins enhanced potency by up to two orders of magnitude, in a manner dependent upon the resistance&#8208;conferring mutation. Strains that have developed resistance to either rezafungin, the most recently clinically approved echinocandin, or its dehydroxylated derivative RZF&#8208;1, exhibit high resistance to rezafungin while demonstrating moderate resistance to RZF&#8208;1. These findings provide valuable insight for combating echinocandin resistance through chemical modifications.

         <title>Dynamic Shape Change of Liquid Crystal Polymer Based on An Order&#8208;Order Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodomain liquid crystal polymer exhibits dynamic shape changes, undergoing extension first and then contraction during both heating and cooling. This behavior is driven by a dynamic order&#8208;order smectic C to smectic A phase transition.







Abstract
Liquid crystal actuators conventionally undergo shape changes across an order&#8208;disorder phase transition between liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic phases. In this study, we introduce an innovative Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) actuator harnessing an order&#8208;order LC phase transition mechanism. The LCP film is easily stretchable within the LC phase, facilitated by the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl groups serving as robust physical crosslinking points, and thereby transforms to a stable monodomain structure. The resultant monodomain LCP actuator shows a distinctive reversible dynamic shape change, exhibiting extension followed by contraction along the LC director on cooling. The extension is propelled by the reversible smectic C to smectic A phase transition, and the contraction is attributed to the re&#8208;entry to the smectic C phase from smectic A phase. Thermal annealing temperature determines this peculiar dynamic shape change, which occurs during both heating and cooling processes. This pivotal attribute finds manifestation in gripper and flower&#8208;shaped actuators, adeptly executing grabbing and releasing as well as blooming and closure motions within a single thermal stimulation. In essence, our study introduces an innovative approach to the realm of LCP actuators, ushering in a new avenue for the design and fabrication of versatile and dynamically responsive LCP actuators.

         <title>Reaction Kinetics using a Chemputable Framework for Data Collection and Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ChemPU platform streamlines chemistry by automating kinetic measurements, bridging synthesis and analysis. It's versatile, adaptable, and facilitates precise data encoding of reactions via the Chemical Description Language (XDL). This innovation has the potential to enhance efficiency and create a valuable database of kinetic data for broader applications.







Abstract
Automated chemistry platforms have been widely explored, but many focus on fixed tasks for chemical synthesis or analysis. However, a typical synthetic chemistry workflow utilizes both, such as kinetic measurements for reaction development and optimization. Due to their repetitive and time&#8208;consuming nature, kinetic measurements are often omitted, which limits the mechanistic investigation of reactions. Herein, we present a &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; platform with on&#8208;line analytics (UV/Vis, NMR) which automates routine kinetic measurements. The system's capabilities are showcased by exploring an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder using initial rate measurements, a metal complexation using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA), and formation of a series of tosylamide derivatives using Hammett analysis. Over 60 individual experiments are presented which required minimal intervention, highlighting the significant time savings of automation. Owing to the modular design of the platform, which facilitates rapid integration of commercial analytical tools, our approach is widely accessible and adjustable to the reaction under investigation. The platform is operated using the chemical programming language, XDL, hence experimental procedures and results are stored in a precise, computer&#8208;readable format. We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isoxeniolide A
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>

The total synthesis of the xenicane&#8208;type marine natural product isoxeniolide A has been accomplished through a ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis sequence and an intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction to forge the nine&#8208;membered ring as the key enabling steps. The NHK cyclization was highly diastereoselective and provided the oxabicyclo[7.4.0]tridecene core of isoxeniolide A as a single stereoisomer.







Abstract
Isoxeniolide A is a highly strained xenicane diterpenoid of marine origin. This natural product is representative for a subfamily of xenicanes incorporating an allylic hydroxy group in the nine&#8208;membered ring; members of this xenicane subfamily so far have not been targeted by total synthesis. Herein, we describe the first asymmetric total synthesis of isoxeniolide A. Key to forming the challenging E&#8208;configured cyclononene ring was a diastereoselective intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction. Other important transformations include an enzymatic desymmetrization for absolute stereocontrol, a diastereoselective cuprate addition and the use of a bifunctional vinyl silane building block. Our strategy also permits access to the enantiomer of the natural product and holds potential to access a multitude of xenicane natural products and analogs for structure&#8211;activity relationship studies.

         <title>Senolysis Enabled by Senescent Cell&#8208;Sensitive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal chemistry&#8208;based senolytic strategy for the selective treatment of senescent cells has been developed. We demonstrate that a dihydrotetrazine&#8208;galactose conjugate (Gal&#8208;Tz) can be selectively converted into the free tetrazine by senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This strategy can be harnessed for bioorthogonal imaging as well as prodrug delivery and activation in senescent cancer cells.







Abstract
Although the clearance of senescent cells has been proven to slow down the aging process and promote anti&#8208;cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell&#8208;sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is based on linking dihydrotetrazine (Tz) to a galactose (Gal) moiety that serves both as a recognition moiety for senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and a caging group for the control of tetrazine activity. Gal&#8208;Tz enables efficient click&#8208;release of a fluorescent hemicyanine and doxorubicin from a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non&#8208;senescent counterparts with a 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for the selective activation and delivery of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO&#8208;ARV&#8208;771 can be selectively activated by Gal&#8208;Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce the degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4. Senolytic PROTACs may offer an efficient way for intervention on cell senescence thanks to their unique capacity to degrade target proteins in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of this study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.

         <title>Selective and Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Formate on Copper Electrodes Modified by Cationic Gemini Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity and activity of formate over the copper electrode are dramatically promoted by the modification of cationic Gemini surfactants. Furthermore, on a Gemini surfactant modified Bi2O3 electrode, a formate FE of 91&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This improvement in formate production was attributed to the combined effects of the cations and alkyl chains present in the Gemini surfactants.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising strategy to mitigate energy and environmental problems. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity for a single product and inadequate electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the first work to use cationic Gemini surfactants as modifiers to boost CO2 electroreduction to formate. The selectivity, activity and stability of the catalysts can be all significantly enhanced by Gemini surfactant modification. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate could reach up to 96&#8201;%, and the energy efficiency (EE) could achieve 71&#8201;% over the Gemini surfactants modified Cu electrode. In addition, the Gemini surfactants modified commercial Bi2O3 nanosheets also showed an excellent catalytic performance, and the FE of formate reached 91&#8201;% with a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using the flow cell. Detailed studies demonstrated that the double quaternary ammonium cations and alkyl chains of the Gemini surfactants played a crucial role in boosting electroreduction CO2, which can not only stabilize the key intermediate HCOO* but also provide an easy access for CO2. These observations could shine light on the rational design of organic modifiers for promoted CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Unlocking the Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Acyclic Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and highly selective Ir&#8208;catalysts have been developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted acyclic enones. The mechanism and the effects of the catalyst and reaction parameters on selectivity have been unraveled by means of deuterogenation experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of tetrasubstituted olefins generating two stereocenters is still an open topic. There are only a few reports on the AH of tetrasubstituted olefins with conjugated functional groups, while this process can create useful intermediates for the subsequent elaboration of relevant end products. Most of the tetrasubstituted olefins successfully submitted to AH belong to a small number of functional classes; remarkably, the AH of tetrasubstituted acyclic enones still represents an unsolved challenge. Herein, we disclose a class of air&#8208;stable Ir&#8722;P,N catalysts, prepared in three steps from commercially available amino alcohols, that can hydrogenate, in minutes, a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse acyclic tetrasubstituted enones (including exocyclic ones) with high yields and high enantioselectivities. The factors responsible for the excellent selectivities were elucidated by combining deuterogenation experiments and theoretical calculations. The calculations indicated that the reduction follows an IrI/IrIII mechanism, in which enantioselectivity is controlled in the first migratory insertion of the hydride to the most electrophilic olefinic C&#946; and the formation of the hydrogenated product via reductive elimination takes place prior to the coordination of dihydrogen and the subsequent oxidative addition. The potential of the new catalytic systems is demonstrated by the derivatization of hydrogenation products.

         <title>Facilitating the Electrochemical Oxidation of ZnS through Iodide Catalysis for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible conversion of sulfur cathodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries is realized by applying the highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 catalyst. Experimental and computational results indicate that abundant iodide ions adsorbed on ZnS nanoparticles surface regulate the d&#8208;band center of Zn, leading to atomic rearrangements, and therefore promoting the electro&#8208;oxidation of ZnS to S.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur (Zn&#8208;S) batteries show great potential for unlocking high energy and safety aqueous batteries. Yet, the sluggish kinetic and poor redox reversibility of the sulfur conversion reaction in aqueous solution challenge the development of Zn&#8208;S batteries. Here, we fabricate a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;S battery using highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 as an effective catalyst. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between I&#8722; and the ZnS nanoparticles (discharge product) leads to the atomic rearrangement of ZnS, weakening the Zn&#8208;S bonding, and thus facilitating the electrochemical oxidation reaction of ZnS to S. The aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery exhibited a high energy density of 742&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 at the power density of 210.8&#8197;W&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn&#8208;S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the power density of 210.8&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;(sulfur)&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn-S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high-performance aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of curved metalloporphyrin tectons via a combination of coordinative and non&#8208;covalent interactions leads to unprecedented supramolecular solids with extremely large void volumes. The intricate interaction patterns found in these solids are analogous to those in some metal&#8208; and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, offering new routes toward porous molecular crystals.







Abstract
A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8208;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68&#8201;% to 76&#8201;%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.

         <title>Enhanced TROSY Effect in [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C] Adenosine and ATP Analogs Facilitates NMR Spectroscopy of Very Large Biological RNAs in Solution</title>

2&#8208;19F&#8208;2&#8208;13C adenosine&#8212;large RNAs in reach of NMR. An aromatic 19F&#8208;13C isotope labelling protocol for adenosine at position 2 is introduced. The TROSY properties outcompete previous CF pyrimidine labelling Schemes and allowed dynamics, structure, and interaction characterization of 61&#8211;124&#8197;nt 20&#8211;40&#8197;kD RNAs by solution NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Large RNAs are central to cellular functions, but characterizing such RNAs remains challenging by solution NMR. We present two labeling technologies based on [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine, which allow the incorporation of aromatic 19F&#8208;13C spin pairs. The labels when coupled with the transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) enable us to probe RNAs comprising up to 124&#8197;nucleotides. With our new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;phosphoramidite, all resonances of the human hepatitis&#8197;B virus epsilon RNA could be readily assigned. With [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine triphosphate, the 124&#8197;nt pre&#8208;miR&#8208;17&#8208;NPSL1&#8208;RNA was produced via in vitro transcription and the TROSY spectrum of this 40&#8197;kDa [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A&#8208;labeled RNA featured sharper resonances than the [2&#8208;1H, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A sample. The mutual cancelation of the chemical&#8208;shift&#8208;anisotropy and the dipole&#8208;dipole&#8208;components of TROSY&#8208;resonances leads to narrow linewidths over a wide range of molecular weights. With the synthesis of a non&#8208;hydrolysable [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;triphosphate, we facilitate the probing of co&#8208;factor binding in kinase complexes and NMR&#8208;based inhibitor binding studies in such systems. Our labels allow a straightforward assignment for larger RNAs via a divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer/mutational approach. The new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine precursors are a valuable addition to the RNA NMR toolbox and will allow the study of large RNAs/RNA protein complexes in vitro and in cells.

         <title>Enhanced Directed Evolution in Mammalian Cells Yields a Hyperefficient Pyrrolysyl tRNA for Noncanonical Amino Acid Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an optimized virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution Scheme in mammalian cells, an enhanced variant of the M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA, PyOtR, was developed. PyOtR enabled improved incorporation of many noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins expressed in mammalian cells, and enabled facile generation of cell lines stably expressing the ncAA incorporation machinery.







Abstract
Heterologous tRNAs used for noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells typically show poor activity. We recently introduced a virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution strategy (VADER) that can enrich improved tRNA mutants from na&#239;ve libraries in mammalian cells. However, VADER was limited to processing only a few thousand mutants; the inability to screen a larger sequence space precluded the identification of highly active variants with distal synergistic mutations. Here, we report VADER2.0, which can process significantly larger mutant libraries. It also employs a novel library design, which maintains base&#8208;pairing between distant residues in the stem regions, allowing us to pack a higher density of functional mutants within a fixed sequence space. VADER2.0 enabled simultaneous engineering of the entire acceptor stem of M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA (tRNAPyl), leading to a remarkably improved variant, which facilitates more efficient incorporation of a wider range of ncAAs, and enables facile development of viral vectors and stable cell&#8208;lines for ncAA mutagenesis.

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a viscosity&#8208;sensitive, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe, ER&#8208;ZS, which can monitor ER stress&#8208;induced viscosity changes in real time. ER&#8208;ZS is also an excellent anti&#8208;hypoxia type&#8197;I photosensitizer that activates tumor cell pyroptosis by damaging the ER pathway.







Abstract
The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type&#8197;I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2&#8201;% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.

In addition, &lt;b&gt;ER-ZS&lt;/b&gt;, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, &lt;b&gt;ER-ZS&lt;/b&gt; is a type&#8197;I photosensitizer, producing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8901;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The spiro[3.3]heptane core, with the non&#8208;coplanar exit vectors, was shown to be a saturated benzene bioisostere. This scaffold was incorporated into the anticancer drug sonidegib (instead of the meta&#8208;benzene), the anticancer drug vorinostat (instead of the phenyl ring), and the anesthetic drug benzocaine (instead of the para&#8208;benzene). The patent&#8208;free saturated analogs obtained showed a high potency in the corresponding biological assays.

         <title>A Double&#8208;ligand Chelating Strategy to Iron Complex Anolytes with Ultrahigh Cyclability for Aqueous Iron Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy was proposed to design Fe(TEA)MM complex as anolyte materials with high binding energy, robust coordination structure, highly electrochemical activity and good reversibility. All iron flow batteries based on Fe(TEA)MM anolytes and Fe(CN)6 catholytes reach a low capital cost of $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 and record&#8208;breaking cycling stability without detectable energy efficiency and capacity decay during 1400 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron flow batteries (AIFBs) are attractive for large&#8208;scale and long&#8208;term energy storage due to their extremely low cost and safety features. To accelerate commercial application, a long cyclable and reversible iron anolyte is expected to address the critical barriers, namely iron dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a robust iron complex with triethanolamine (TEA) and 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MM) double ligands. By introducing two ligands into one iron center, the binding energy of the complex increases, making it more stable in the charge&#8208;discharge reactions. The Fe(TEA)MM complex achieves reversible and stable redox between Fe3+ and Fe2+, without metallic iron growth and HER. AIFBs based on this anolyte perform a high energy efficiency of 80.5&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a record durability among reported AIFBs. The efficiency and capacity retain nearly 100&#8201;% after 1,400 cycles. The capital cost of this AIFB is $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 (e.g., 20&#8197;h duration), cheaper than Li&#8208;ion battery and vanadium flow battery. This double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy not only solves the current problems faced by AIFBs, but also provides an insight for further improving the cycling stability of other flow batteries.

         <title>Reconstructed Bismuth Oxide through in situ Carbonation by Carbonate&#8208;containing Electrolyte for Highly Active Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonate in the electrolyte was found to affect the chemical evolution of the catalyst and further lead to changes in the catalyst performance. Especially, the Bi2O3 with weak CO32&#8722; adsorption underwent an in situ carbonation to form surface Bi2O2CO3 layer in CO2 purged KOH electrolyte. The reconstructed Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure with strong electron interaction served as a highly active structure and promoted the formation of formate.







Abstract
The catalyst&#8208;reconstruction makes it challenging to clarify the practical active sites and unveil the actual reaction mechanism during the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). However, currently the impact of the electrolyte microenvironment in which the electrolyte is in contact with the catalyst is overlooked and might induce a chemical evolution, thus confusing the reconstruction process and mechanism. In this work, the carbonate adsorption properties of metal oxides were investigated, and the mechanism of how the electrolyte carbonate affect the chemical evolution of catalysts were discussed. Notably, Bi2O3 with weak carbonate adsorption underwent a chemical reconstruction to form the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ characterizations unveiled the formation mechanism of the heterostructure. The in situ formed Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure with strong electron interaction served as the highly active structure for CO2RR, achieving a formate Faradaic efficiency of 98.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8 Vvs RHE. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the significantly tuned p&#8208;orbit electrons of the Bi sites in Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 optimized the adsorption of the intermediate and lowered the energy barrier for the formation of *OCHO. This work elucidates the mechanism of electrolyte microenvironment for affecting catalyst reconstruction, which contributes to the understanding of reconstruction process and clarification of the actual catalytic structure.

         <title>Binary All&#8208;polymer Solar Cells with a Perhalogenated&#8208;Thiophene&#8208;Based Solid Additive Surpass 18&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric perhalogenated thiophenes were reported as solid additives to optimize the morphological characters of all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). Among them, power conversion efficiency over 18&#8201;% and long&#8208;term thermal stability (T90 lifetime is 550&#8197;hours) were realized for SA&#8208;T1&#8208;treated binary APSC, providing a possibility for obtaining high&#8208;performance APSCs.







Abstract
Morphological control of all&#8208;polymer blends is quintessential yet challenging in fabricating high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Recently, solid additives (SAs) have been approved to be capable in tuning the morphology of polymer: small&#8208;molecule blends improving the performance and stability of devices. Herein, three perhalogenated thiophenes, which are 3,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,5&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T1), 2,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;3,4&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T2), and 2,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;4,5&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T3), were adopted as SAs to optimize the performance of all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). For the blend of PM6 and PY&#8208;IT, benefitting from the intermolecular interactions between perhalogenated thiophenes and polymers, the molecular packing properties could be finely regulated after introducing these SAs. In situ UV/Vis measurement revealed that these SAs could assist morphological character evolution in the all&#8208;polymer blend, leading to their optimal morphologies. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT, all SA&#8208;treated binary devices displayed enhanced power conversion efficiencies of 17.4&#8211;18.3&#8201;% with obviously elevated short&#8208;circuit current densities and fill factors. To our knowledge, the PCE of 18.3&#8201;% for SA&#8208;T1&#8208;treated binary ranks the highest among all binary APSCs to date. Meanwhile, the universality of SA&#8208;T1 in other all&#8208;polymer blends is demonstrated with unanimously improved device performance. This work provide a new pathway in realizing high&#8208;performance APSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Three isomeric perhalogenated thiophenes were reported as solid additives to optimize the morphological characters of all-polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). Among them, power conversion efficiency over 18&#8201;% and long-term thermal stability (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime is 550&#8197;hours) were realized for SA-T1-treated binary APSC, providing a possibility for obtaining high-performance APSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphological control of all-polymer blends is quintessential yet challenging in fabricating high-performance organic solar cells. Recently, solid additives (SAs) have been approved to be capable in tuning the morphology of polymer: small-molecule blends improving the performance and stability of devices. Herein, three perhalogenated thiophenes, which are 3,4-dibromo-2,5-diiodothiophene (SA-T1), 2,5-dibromo-3,4-diiodothiophene (SA-T2), and 2,3-dibromo-4,5-diiodothiophene (SA-T3), were adopted as SAs to optimize the performance of all-polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). For the blend of PM6 and PY-IT, benefitting from the intermolecular interactions between perhalogenated thiophenes and polymers, the molecular packing properties could be finely regulated after introducing these SAs. In situ UV/Vis measurement revealed that these SAs could assist morphological character evolution in the all-polymer blend, leading to their optimal morphologies. Compared to the as-cast device of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY-IT, all SA-treated binary devices displayed enhanced power conversion efficiencies of 17.4&#8211;18.3&#8201;% with obviously elevated short-circuit current densities and fill factors. To our knowledge, the PCE of 18.3&#8201;% for SA-T1-treated binary ranks the highest among all binary APSCs to date. Meanwhile, the universality of SA-T1 in other all-polymer blends is demonstrated with unanimously improved device performance. This work provide a new pathway in realizing high-performance APSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acetamide Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrite in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen waste species in water. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime, an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide over copper catalysts under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen species. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide for the first time over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2 and wastewater.

         <title>Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enables facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicks catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2 via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme.







Abstract
A nanozyme with neighboring single&#8208;iron sites (Fe2&#8208;SAzyme) was introduced as a bioinspired catalase mimic, featuring excellent activity under varied conditions, twice as high as that of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme and ultrahigh H2O2 affinity as that of bioenzymes. Surprisingly, the interatomic spacing tuning between adjacent iron sites also suppressed the competitive peroxidase pathway, remarkably increasing the catalase/peroxidase selectivity up to ~6 times compared to Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. This dramatically switched the catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating (i.e. Fe1&#8208;SAzymes, preferably mimicking peroxidase) to scavenging ROS (i.e. Fe2&#8208;SAzymes, dominantly mimicking catalase). Theoretical and experimental investigations suggested that the pairwise single&#8208;iron sites may serve as a robust molecular tweezer to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption. The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale, but with no obvious scale&#8208;up effect for both structures and performances.

         <title>Signal Amplification and Near&#8208;Infrared Translation of Enzymatic Reactions by Nanosensors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ELISA substrates and products modulate the near&#8208;infrared fluorescence of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) modified with specific (bio)polymers. The affinity of these nanosensors for the analyte increases the effective local concentration compared to normal absorption measurements. This causes a signal enhancement, which improves the readout of enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Enzymatic reactions are used to detect analytes in a range of biochemical methods. To measure the presence of an analyte, the enzyme is conjugated to a recognition unit and converts a substrate into a (colored) product that is detectable by visible (VIS) light. Thus, the lowest enzymatic turnover that can be detected sets a limit on sensitivity. Here, we report that substrates and products of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase change the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence of (bio)polymer modified single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). They translate a VIS signal into a beneficial NIR signal. Moreover, the affinity of the nanosensors leads to a higher effective local concentration of the reactants. This causes a non&#8208;linear sensor&#8208;based signal amplification and translation (SENSAT). We find signal enhancement up to &#8776;120x for the HRP substrate p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPD), which means that reactions below the limit of detection in the VIS can be followed in the NIR (&#8776;1000&#8197;nm). The approach is also applicable to other substrates such as 3,3&#8242;&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). An adsorption&#8208;based theoretical model fits the observed signals and corroborates the sensor&#8208;based enhancement mechanism. This approach can be used to amplify signals, translate them into the NIR and increase sensitivity of biochemical assays.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Determination of the Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground State of Tridecacene
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tridecacenes were synthesized on Au(111) and their properties were characterized by combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy, inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many body calculations. The study confirmed the open&#8208;shell diradical character and demonstrated that the magnitude of the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap is affected by the proximity of the surface as well as a dynamic electron correlation.







Abstract
The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open&#8208;shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on&#8208;surface synthesis of tridecacene molecules by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on a Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of an inelastic signal at 126&#8197;meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carried out many&#8208;body ab initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonians to take into account the effect of the metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamic electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between the molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap. Thus, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.

The study confirmed the open-shell diradical character and demonstrated that the magnitude of the singlet-triplet band gap is affected by the proximity of the surface as well as a dynamic electron correlation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open-shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on-surface synthesis of tridecacene molecules by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on a Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of an inelastic signal at 126&#8197;meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carried out many-body ab initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonians to take into account the effect of the metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamic electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between the molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet-triplet band gap. Thus, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered W18O49&#8722;x Nanobrush with a Suitable Band Structure for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV was prepared by a solvothermal method for efficient sonodynamic therapy. Abundant oxygen vacancies were introduced into the nanobrush through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction reaction and can serve as charge traps to inhibit e&#8722;&#8208;h+ recombination. The almost ideal band structures of the nanobrush endow it with the potential to simultaneously produce 1O2, &#8901;O2&#8722;, and &#8901;OH under ultrasound irradiation.







Abstract
With the rapid development of external minimally invasive or noninvasive therapeutic modalities, ultrasound&#8208;based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new alternative for treating deep tumors. However, inadequate sonosensitizer efficiency and poor biosecurity limit clinical applications. In this study, we prepared an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV for highly efficient SDT using a simple solvothermal method. The suitable band structures of the W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush endows it with the potential to simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;), and hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) under ultrasound irradiation. Additionally, abundant oxygen vacancies that serve as further charge traps that inhibit electron&#8208;hole recombination are incidentally introduced through one&#8208;step thermal reduction. Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush delivers highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT in a very biosafe manner. Overall, this study provides a new avenue for discovering and designing inorganic nanosonosensitizers with enhanced therapeutic efficiencies for use in SDT.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Protein Assemblies with Tunable Vesicular and Hierarchical Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein assemblies with tunable microstructures, including single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and doughnut&#8208;shaped hierarchical&#8208;structured protein aggregates. The as&#8208;prepared protein aggregates display morphology&#8208;dependent cell uptake.







Abstract
The construction of variable structured multi&#8208;protein nano&#8208;assemblies is of great interest for the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutic systems. This study showcases the synthesis of polymer&#8208;protein assemblies with tunable structure like single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and other hierarchical&#8208;structured assemblies by utilizing a dynamic template&#8208;assistant intermittent&#8208;assembly approach. The generalization of the methodology helps the protein assemblies to gain notable functional complexity. And we demonstrate compelling evidence highlighting the substantial impact of the topological morphology of protein nanoaggregates on their cellular uptake capacity.

         <title>Stereoselective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides Using Salen Aluminum Catalysts: A Route to High&#8208;Isotactic Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of salen aluminum catalysts for the stereoselective ROP of various SCAs without epimerization, affording functionalized polythioester with high molecular weight up to 37.6&#8197;kDa and the highest Pm value up to 0.99. Notably, the ROP of TlaSCA (SCA prepared from thiolactic acid) generates the first example of a isotactic crystalline poly(thiolactic acid), which exhibited a distinct Tm value of 152.6&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Polythioesters are important sustainable polymers with broad applications. The ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides (SCAs) can afford polythioesters with functional groups that are typically difficult to prepare by ROP of thiolactones. Typical methods involving organocatalysts, like dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and triethylamine (Et3N), have been plagued by uncontrolled polymerization, including epimerization for most SCAs resulting in the loss of isotacticity. Here, we report the use of salen aluminum catalysts for the selective ROP of various SCAs without epimerization, affording functionalized polythioester with high molecular weight up to 37.6&#8197;kDa and the highest Pm value up to 0.99. Notably, the ROP of TlaSCA (SCA prepared from thiolactic acid) generates the first example of a isotactic crystalline poly(thiolactic acid), which exhibited a distinct Tm value of 152.6&#8201;&#176;C. Effective ligand tailoring governs the binding affinity between the sulfide chain&#8208;end and the metal center, thereby maintaining the activity of organometallic catalysts and reducing the occurrence of epimerization reactions.

         <title>Rational Design of Dinitroxide Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization to Enhance Overall NMR Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eighteen nitroxide biradicals for DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR are compared at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. Among the best performing radicals, the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, works well in both organic and aqueous solvents, making it a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.







Abstract
We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build&#8208;up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall sensitivity across a range of biradicals. NaphPol and HydroPol are found to provide the best overall sensitivity factors, in organic and aqueous solvents respectively. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, provides high sensitivity for all three solvent formulations measured here, and can be considered to be a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Base Sites for Transfer Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes on Ceria Nanorods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ceria nanorods are effective for additive&#8208;free synthesis of azoxy&#8208;aromatics by the transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with ethanol as the hydrogen donor. Oxygen vacancies (Ov) and basic sites play a synergistic role, where Ov serve as the sites for adsorption and activation of ethanol as well as nitroarenes, which greatly decreases the activation energy of hydrogen atom transfer from &#945;&#8722;Csp3&#8722;H in ethanol to nitro groups.







Abstract
CeO2 nanorod based catalysts for the base&#8208;free synthesis of azoxy&#8208;aromatics via transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with ethanol as hydrogen donor have been synthesized and investigated. The oxygen vacancies (Ov) and base sites are critical for their excellent catalytic properties. The Ov, i.e., undercoordinated Ce cations, serve as the sites to activate ethanol and nitroarenes by lowering the energy barrier to transfer hydrogen from &#945;&#8722;Csp3&#8722;H in ethanol to the nitro group coupling it to the redox reactions between Ce3+ and Ce4+. At the same time, the base sites catalyze the condensation step to selectively produce azoxy&#8208;aromatics. The catalytic route opens a much improved way to use non&#8208;noble metal oxides without additives for the selective functional group reduction and coupling reactions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Species Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) thin films are obtained by reconstructing perovskite surface with GASCN/NaSCN. This surface reconstruction can repair surface defects of PNC, maintain the integrity of crystal structure, and suppress F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, thus enabling highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) solution has exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the luminance would be severely quenched when the PNC solution is assembled into thin films due to the agglomeration and fusion of NCs caused by the exfoliation of surface ligands and non&#8208;radiative F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from small to large particle sizes, which seriously affected the performances of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we used Guanidine thiocyanate (GASCN) and Sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) to achieve effective CsPbI3 PNC surface reconstruction. Due to the strong coordination ability of these small molecules with the anions and cations on the surface of the PNCs, they can provide strong surface protection against PNC fusion during centrifugal purification process and repair the surface defects of PNCs, so that the original uniform size distribution of PNCs can be maintained and FRET between close&#8208;packed PNC films is effectively suppressed, which allows the emission characteristics of the films to be preserved. As a result, highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free high&#8208;quality PNC thin films are obtained, with PLQY as high as 95.1&#8201;%, far exceeding that of the original film, and corresponding LEDs exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Stabilization of NH&#8722; Group Adjacent to Naked Silicon(II) Atom in Base Stabilized Aminosilylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the isolation of the first examples of free aminosilylenes 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b having &#8722;NH group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Aminosilylenes showed unique reactivity upon heating; an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation with 1&#8201;a afforded cyclic silazane, whereas 1&#8201;b showed a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to afford rare silanimine.







Abstract
Aminosilylene, comprising reactive NH&#8722; and Si(II) sites next to each other, is an intriguing class of compounds due to its ability to show diverse reactivity. However, stabilizing the reactive NH&#8722; group next to the free Si(II) atom is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, we report the first examples of base stabilized free aminosilylenes Ar*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;a) and Mes*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;b) (Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl and Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl), tolerating a NH&#8722; group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Remarkably, 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b exhibited interesting differences in their reactivity upon heating. With 1&#8201;a, an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of one of the benzhydryl methine hydrogen atoms to the Si(II) atom produced the five&#8208;membered cyclic silazane 2. However, with 1&#8201;b, a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to the Si(II) atom afforded a silanimine 3, with a hydride ligand attached to an unsaturated silicon atom. Further, the coordination capabilities of 1&#8201;a were also tested with Ru(II) and Fe(0) precursors. Treatments of 1&#8201;a with [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 led to the isolation of a &#951;6&#8208;arene tethered complex [RuCl2{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene}] (4), whereas with the Fe(CO)5 precursor a Fe(0) complex [Fe(CO)4{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si}] (5) was obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to shed light on the structural, bonding, and energetic aspects in 1&#8211;5.

         <title>Thermally Healable Electrolyte&#8208;Electrode Interface for Sustainable Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by jellies, we design a dynamically healable hydrogel electrolyte with a highly reversible sol&#8208;gel transition, which can effectively repair the inherent non&#8208;conformal electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to form a stable conformal solid&#8208;solid interface.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid zinc&#8208;ion batteries using hydrogel electrolytes show great potential in energy storage devices owing to their intrinsic safety, fewer side reactions and wide electrochemical windows. However, the dendrite issues on the zinc anodes cannot be fundamentally eliminated and the intrinsic anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspace is rarely investigated. Here, we design a dynamically healable gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte with a highly reversible sol&#8208;gel transition, which can construct a conformal electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and further evolve into a stable solid&#8208;solid interface by in situ solidification. The unique helical gelatin chain structure provides a uniform channel for zinc ion transport by the bridging effect of sulfate groups. As a consequence, the dynamically healable interface enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes and repeatedly repairs the anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspaces by the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition of gelatin electrolyte to retain long&#8208;lasting protection for sustainable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Accelerating the Reaction Kinetics of CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Synergistic Effect between Cation and Aprotic Solvent on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of cation and aprotic solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) in a neutral electrolyte can improve the selectivity of C2+ products for CO2 reduction reaction. Among them, the synergistic effect not only enhances C&#8722;C coupling, but also decreases the water network connectivity &#8208; which suppresses C1 product formation and hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Improving the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is an important and highly challenging topic. In this work, we propose and validate an effective strategy to improve C2+ selectivity on Cu electrodes, by introducing a synergistic effect between cation (Na+) and aprotic solvent (DMSO) to the electrolyte. Based on constant potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we first revealed that Na+ facilitates C&#8722;C coupling while inhibits CH3OH/CH4 products via reducing the water network connectivity near the electrode. Furthermore, the water network connectivity was further decreased by introducing an aprotic solvent DMSO, leading to suppression of both C1 production and hydrogen evolution reaction with minimal effect on *OCCO* hydrogenation. The synergistic effect enhancing C2 selectivity was also experimentally verified through electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the Faradaic efficiency of C2 increases from 9.3&#8201;% to 57&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA/cm2 under a mixed electrolyte of NaHCO3 and DMSO compared to a pure NaHCO3, which can significantly enhance the selectivity of the C2 product. Therefore, our discovery provides an effective electrolyte&#8208;based strategy for tuning CO2RR selectivity through modulating the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.

         <title>Pivotal Role of Geometry Regulation on O&#8722;O Bond Formation Mechanism of Bimetallic Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>

Does proximity make a difference? The progression of O&#8722;O bond formation through an oxyl/hydroxide coupling in water oxidation catalyzed by Cu2 complexes is greatly influenced by the catalyst's geometry.







Abstract
In this study, we highlight the impact of catalyst geometry on the formation of O&#8722;O bonds in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. A series of Cu2 complexes with diverse linkers are designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Interestingly, the catalytic performance of these Cu2 complexes is enhanced as their molecular skeletons become more rigid, which contrasts with the behavior observed in our previous investigation with Fe2 analogs. Moreover, mechanistic studies reveal that the reactivity of the bridging O atom results in distinct pathways for O&#8722;O bond formation in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. In Cu2 systems, the coupling takes place between a terminal CuIII&#8722;OH and a bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8901; radical. Whereas in Fe2 systems, it involves the coupling of two terminal Fe&#8211;oxo entities. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth structure&#8211;activity analysis uncovers the spatial geometric prerequisites for the coupling of the terminal OH with the bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8901; radical, ultimately leading to the O&#8722;O bond formation. Overall, this study emphasizes the critical role of precisely adjusting the spatial geometry of catalysts to align with the O&#8722;O bonding pathway.

         <title>A Flexible Synthesis of Polypropionates via Diastereodivergent Reductive Ring&#8208;Opening of Trisubstituted Secondary Glycidols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our novel approach towards polypropionate synthesis features stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks. The key&#8208;step of diversification is accomplished by mechanism&#8208;control of the diastereodivergent reductive opening at the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom that occurs with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Polypropionates, characterized by their alternating sequence of stereocenters bearing methyl&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;groups, are structurally diverse natural products of utmost importance.[1] Herein, we introduce a novel concept approach towards polypropionate synthesis featuring a diastereodivergent reductive epoxide&#8208;opening as a key step. Readily available and stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols serve as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks with three or more consecutive stereocenters. Stereodiversification is accomplished by an unprecedented mechanism&#8208;control over the stereochemically complementary modification of the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Since our method is not only suited for the preparation of specific targets but also for compound libraries, it will have a great impact on polypropionate synthesis.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Calcium Overload from Endogenous Sources for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate ROS to stimulate the TRPA1 channel and realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. At the same time, photothermo&#8208;controlled NO generation could open the RyR channel in the ER and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Through the combination of dual channels, Ca2+ overload would occur in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Designing reactive calcium&#8208;based nanogenerators to produce excess calcium ions (Ca2+) in tumor cells is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, nanogenerators that introduce exogenous Ca2+ are either overactive incapable of on&#8208;demand release, or excessively inert incapable of an overload of calcium rapidly. Herein, inspired by inherently diverse Ca2+&#8208;regulating channels, a photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ nanomodulator that fully utilizes endogenous Ca2+ from dual sources was designed to achieve Ca2+ overload in tumor cells. Specifically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used to co&#8208;load bifunctional indocyanine green as a photodynamic/photothermal agent and a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (BNN&#8208;6). Thereafter, they were coated with hyaluronic acid, which served as a tumor cell&#8208;targeting unit and a gatekeeper. Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate reactive oxygen species that stimulate the transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel to realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. Simultaneously, the converted heat can induce BNN&#8208;6 decomposition to generate NO, which would open the ryanodine receptor channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ influx and release could enable Ca2+ overload in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.

A patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model to rapidly, precisely and individually evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing is presented. This study bridges the gap between clinical translation and basic research in metalloimmunology, accelerating drug discovery for cancer immunotherapy and facilitating individualized precision medicine.







Abstract
Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these, Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent, demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;18 Labeling Reveals a Mixed Fe&#8722;O Mechanism in the Last Step of Cytochrome P450 51 Sterol 14&#945;&#8208;Demethylation</title>

         <dc:description>
P450 51 enzymes demethylate sterols, releasing formic acid (DCOOH). Analysis of the DCOOH by&#8208;product enables the mechanistic discrimination of the contribution(s) of Compound 0 (Cpd 0) and Compound I (Cpd I) to catalysis. When enzyme reactions were run under 18O2 (red), &gt;50&#8201;% of the DCOOH yielded contained one atom of 18O (for all P450 51 enzymes tested), indicative of the major contribution of Cpd 0 in 24,25&#8208;dihydrolanosterol C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
The 14&#945;&#8208;demethylation step is critical in eukaryotic sterol biosynthesis, catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) Family 51 enzymes, for example, with lanosterol in mammals. This conserved three&#8208;step reaction terminates in a C&#8722;C cleavage step that generates formic acid, the nature of which has been controversial. Proposed mechanisms involve roles of P450 Compound 0 (ferric peroxide anion, FeO2&#8722;) or Compound I (perferryl oxygen, FeO3+) reacting with either the aldehyde or its hydrate, respectively. Analysis of 18O incorporation into formic acid from 18O2 provides a means of distinguishing the two mechanisms. Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88&#8201;% 18O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO2&#8722; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen atom 3.5&#8197;&#197; away from the heme iron atom. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H218O yielded primarily one 18O atom but 14&#8201;% of the formic acid product with two 18O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8211;MS evidence for a Compound 0&#8208;derived Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;&#8208;formyl ester) was also found.

         <title>Supramolecular Hydrolase Mimics in Equilibrium and Kinetically Trapped States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic peptides have been shown to undergo pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly into kinetically trapped and thermodynamic equilibrium structures, which displayed distinct supramolecular behaviors and catalytic activity. The key role of static and dynamic supramolecular structures in dictating substrate&#8208;peptide interaction and the involvement of interfacial water in catalytic hydrolysis reactions is highlighted.







Abstract
The folding of proteins into intricate three&#8208;dimensional structures to achieve biological functions, such as catalysis, is governed by both kinetic and thermodynamic controls. The quest to design artificial enzymes using minimalist peptides seeks to emulate supramolecular structures existing in a catalytically active state. Drawing inspiration from the nuanced process of protein folding, our study explores the enzyme&#8208;like activity of amphiphilic peptide nanosystems in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states, featuring the formation of supramolecular nanofibrils and nanosheets. In contrast to thermodynamically stable nanosheets, the kinetically trapped nanofibrils exhibit dynamic characteristics (e.g., rapid molecular exchange and relatively weak intermolecular packing), resulting in a higher hydrolase&#8208;mimicking activity. We emphasize that a supramolecular microenvironment characterized by an optimal local polarity, microviscosity, and &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonding is conducive to both substrate binding and ester bond hydrolysis. Our work underscores the pivotal role of both thermodynamic and kinetic control in impacting biomimetic catalysis and sheds a light on the development of artificial enzymes.

         <title>Structural Distortion in the Wadsley&#8208;Roth Niobium Molybdenum Oxide Phase Triggering Extraordinarily Stable Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relief of octahedral distortion in niobium molybdenum oxides during cycling enhances the structural stability of battery active materials, resulting in an exceptional cycle lifespan of 15,000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This mechanism offers new insights into stabilizing the material structures of Wadsley&#8208;Roth oxides for significantly prolonged battery life.







Abstract
Wadsley&#8208;Roth niobium oxide phases have attracted extensive research interest recently as promising battery anodes. We have synthesized the niobium&#8208;molybdenum oxide shear phase (Nb, Mo)13O33 with superior electrochemical Li&#8208;ion storage performance, including an ultralong cycling lifespan of at least 15000&#8197;cycles. During electrochemical cycling, a reversible single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution reaction with lithiated intermediate solid solutions is demonstrated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, with the valence and short&#8208;range structural changes of the electrode probed by in situ Nb and Mo K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. This work reveals that the superior stability of niobium molybdenum oxides is underpinned by changes in octahedral distortion during electrochemical reactions, and we report an in&#8208;depth understanding of how this stabilizes the oxide structure during cycling with implications for future long&#8208;life battery material design.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrophobic Tri&#8208;layer Interface Rendered Mechanically Graded Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface is developed through the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte design to create stable electrode/electrolyte interface. The OTF&#8208; rich interface facilitates the formation of mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface. As a result, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enabled zinc metal battery stable operation at practical condition and under wide temperature range.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery is promising as grid scale energy storage device, but hindered by the instable electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, we report the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte for aqueous zinc metal batteries. The lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte creates the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface assembled by first two layers of hydrophobic OTF&#8722; and EMIM+ and third layer of loosely attached water, beyond the classical Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern theory based electrochemical double layer. By taking advantage of the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enables a wide electrochemical working window (2.93&#8197;V) with relatively high zinc ion conductivity (17.3&#8197;mS/cm). Furthermore, the anion crowding interface facilitates the OTF&#8722; decomposition chemistry to create the mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface layer to simultaneously suppress the dendrite formation and maintain the mechanical stability. In this way, the lean&#8208;water based ionic liquid electrolyte realizes the ultralong cyclability of over 10000 cycles at 20&#8197;A/g and at practical condition of N/P ratio of 1.5, the cumulated areal capacity reach 1.8&#8197;Ah/cm2, which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc metal battery performance. Our work highlights the importance of the stable electrode/electrolyte interface stability, which would be practical for building high energy grid scale zinc&#8208;ion battery.

&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical hydrophobic tri-layer interface is developed through the lean-water ionic liquid electrolyte design to create stable electrode/electrolyte interface. The OTF- rich interface facilitates the formation of mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface. As a result, the lean-water ionic liquid electrolyte enabled zinc metal battery stable operation at practical condition and under wide temperature range.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Chiral Figure&#8208;Eight Macrocycles Using a Preorganized Natural Product&#8208;Based Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral D2&#8208;symmetric Figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, which exhibits bright CPL (glum=0.011, &#934;fl=0.74, BCPL=480), was efficiently synthesized using a versatile C2&#8208;symmetric natural product&#8208;based manifold with a preorganized conformation. This rapid and modular synthetic platform allows flexible and precise tuning of the angle, distance, and length among intersecting &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores in shape&#8208;persistent figure&#8208;eight macrocycles.







Abstract
Chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight shaped macrocycles are promising scaffolds for amplifying the chiroptical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. By harnessing the inherent and adaptable conformational dynamics of a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric bispyrrolidinoindoline (BPI) manifold, we developed an enantio&#8208;divergent modular synthetic platform to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14&#8208; to 66&#8208;membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution. Notably, a 32&#8208;membered figure&#8208;eight macrocycle showed excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL: |glum|=1.1&#215;10&#8722;2) complemented by a robust emission quantum yield (&#934;fl=0.74), to achieve outstanding CPL brightness (BCPL: &#1013;&#215;&#934;fl&#215;|glum|/2=480). Using quadruple Sonogashira couplings, this versatile synthetic platform enables precise adjustments of the angle, distance, and length among intersecting &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores. Our synthetic strategy offers a streamlined and systematic approach to significantly enhance BCPL values for a variety of chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles.

The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in&#8208;situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to 1000 grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicked catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme. The precise manipulation of neighboring atomic distance dramatically switched the activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating to scavenging ROS, as reported by Hongyu Chen, Hongbing Ji et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316779).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>

An unexpected regiospecificity in topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization is reported by Kana&#8197;M. Sureshan et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202316513). Based on Schmidt's postulates for topochemical reactions, both the reactivity and the structure of the product were predicted. While the monomer packing predicted a regiospecific reaction to form a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, surprisingly, it formed an unexpected 1,5&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer as a result of massive molecular motion before the TEAC reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An unexpected regiospecificity&lt;/b&gt; in topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization is reported by Kana&#8197;M. Sureshan et&#8197;al. in their Communication &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202316513"&gt;(e202316513)&lt;/a&gt;. Based on Schmidt's postulates for topochemical reactions, both the reactivity and the structure of the product were predicted. While the monomer packing predicted a regiospecific reaction to form a 1,4-triazoline-linked polymer, surprisingly, it formed an unexpected 1,5-triazoline-linked polymer as a result of massive molecular motion before the TEAC reaction.

         <title>Kinetic Asymmetry and Directionality of Nonequilibrium Molecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratchet mechanisms allow external energy to drive pumping or directional motion on the ground state. An energy ratchet uses external modulation to destroy correlations present at equilibrium and an information ratchet uses catalysis and allosteric interactions to create correlations between the energy profile and occupancy of a binding site. A key design principle is kinetic asymmetry&#8212;a difference in barrier heights in the two states of the energy profile.







Abstract
Scientists have long been fascinated by the biomolecular machines in living systems that process energy and information to sustain life. The first synthetic molecular rotor capable of performing repeated 360&#176; rotations due to a combination of photo&#8208; and thermally activated processes was reported in 1999. The progress in designing different molecular machines in the intervening years has been remarkable, with several outstanding examples appearing in the last few years. Despite the synthetic accomplishments, there remains confusion regarding the fundamental design principles by which the motions of molecules can be controlled, with significant intellectual tension between mechanical and chemical ways of thinking about and describing molecular machines. A thermodynamically consistent analysis of the kinetics of several molecular rotors and pumps shows that while light driven rotors operate by a power&#8208;stroke mechanism, kinetic asymmetry&#8212;the relative heights of energy barriers&#8212;is the sole determinant of the directionality of catalysis driven machines. Power&#8208;strokes&#8212;the relative depths of energy wells&#8212;play no role whatsoever in determining the sign of the directionality. These results, elaborated using trajectory thermodynamics and the nonequilibrium pump equality, show that kinetic asymmetry governs the response of many non&#8208;equilibrium chemical phenomena.

         <title>Exploring Peptido&#8208;Nanocomposites in the Context of Amyloid Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review concerns the design principles, working mechanisms and application of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites against amyloidosis, a hallmark of amyloid diseases.







Abstract
Therapeutic peptides are a major class of pharmaceutical drugs owing to their target&#8208;binding specificity as well as their versatility in inhibiting aberrant protein&#8208;protein interactions associated with human pathologies. Within the realm of amyloid diseases, the use of peptides and peptidomimetics tailor&#8208;designed to overcome amyloidogenesis has been an active research endeavor since the late 90s. In more recent years, incorporating nanoparticles for enhancing the biocirculation and delivery of peptide drugs has emerged as a frontier in nanomedicine, and nanoparticles have further demonstrated a potency against amyloid aggregation and cellular inflammation to rival strategies employing small molecules, peptides, and antibodies. Despite these efforts, however, a fundamental understanding of the chemistry, characteristics and function of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites is lacking, and a systematic analysis of such strategy for combating a range of amyloid pathogeneses is missing. Here we review the history, principles and evolving chemistry of constructing peptido&#8208;nanocomposites from bottom up and discuss their future application against amyloid diseases that debilitate a significant portion of the global population.

         <title>Photochromic Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of photoswitchable moieties into biological macromolecules has emerged as a promising approach to manipulate and study complex processes in living organisms. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and provide an overview of design principles, synthetic strategies, analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8211;property relationships and applications.







Abstract
Photochromism is a reversible phenomenon wherein a material undergoes a change in color upon exposure to light. In organic photochromes, this effect often results from light&#8208;induced isomerization reactions, leading to alterations in either the spatial orientation or electronic properties of the photochrome. The incorporation of photochromic moieties into biomolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, has become a prevalent approach to render these biomolecules responsive to light stimuli. Utilizing light as a trigger for the manipulation of biomolecular structure and function offers numerous advantages compared to other stimuli, such as chemical or electrical treatments, due to its non&#8208;invasive nature. Consequently, light proves particularly advantageous in cellular and tissue applications. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the design principles of different classes of photochromes, synthetic strategies, critical analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8211;property relationships. The applications of photochromic nucleic acid derivatives encompass diverse domains, ranging from the precise photoregulation of gene expression to the controlled modulation of the three&#8208;dimensional structures of oligonucleotides and the development of DNA&#8208;based fluorescence modulators. Moreover, we present a future perspective on potential modifications and applications.

Visible light&#8208;induced Pd catalysis typically operates through the transfer of a single electron. The resulting hybrid Pd radical species can participate in a range of radical&#8208;based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional 2&#8208;electron processes. This Minireview highlights the recent progress in this emerging area.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced Pd catalysis has emerged as a promising subfield of photocatalysis. The hybrid nature of Pd radical species has enabled a wide array of radical&#8208;based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional Pd chemistry. In parallel to the ongoing pursuit of alternative, readily available radical precursors, notable discoveries have demonstrated that photoexcitation can alter not only oxidative addition but also other elementary steps. This Minireview highlights the recent progress in this area.

         <title>Colloidal Self&#8208;Assembly: From Passive to Active Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal self&#8208;assembly allows for the formation of diverse intricate structures assembling in natural systems. This Minireview compares the key similarities and differences between passive and active systems and highlights the unique collective behaviors and emergent properties that arise in active systems.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly fundamentally implies the organization of small sub&#8208;units into large structures or patterns without the intervention of specific local interactions. This process is commonly observed in nature, occurring at various scales ranging from atomic/molecular assembly to the formation of complex biological structures. Colloidal particles may serve as micrometer&#8208;scale surrogates for studying assembly, particularly for the poorly understood kinetic and dynamic processes at the atomic scale. Recent advances in colloidal self&#8208;assembly have enabled the programmable creation of novel materials with tailored properties. We here provide an overview and comparison of both passive and active colloidal self&#8208;assembly, with a discussion on the energy landscape and interactions governing both types. In the realm of passive colloidal assembly, many impressive and important structures have been realized, including colloidal molecules, one&#8208;dimensional chains, two&#8208;dimensional lattices, and three&#8208;dimensional crystals. In contrast, active colloidal self&#8208;assembly, driven by optical, electric, chemical, or other fields, involves more intricate dynamic processes, offering more flexibility and potential new applications. A comparative analysis underscores the critical distinctions between passive and active colloidal assemblies, highlighting the unique collective behaviors emerging in active systems. These behaviors encompass collective motion, motility&#8208;induced phase segregation, and exotic properties arising from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics. Through this comparison, we aim to identify the future opportunities in active assembly research, which may suggest new application domains.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of new methods for enantioselective reactions that generate stereogenic centres within molecules is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. In this minireview we highlight the recent advances in enantioselective main group catalysis of the p&#8208;block elements including boron, phosphorus, bismuth and aluminium.







Abstract
The development of new methods for enantioselective reactions that generate stereogenic centres within molecules are a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Typically, metal catalysts bearing chiral ligands as well as chiral organocatalysts have been employed for the enantioselective synthesis of organic compounds. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in main group catalysis for enantioselective reactions using the p&#8208;block elements (boron, aluminium, phosphorus, bismuth) as a complementary and sustainable approach to generate chiral molecules. Several of these catalysts benefit in terms of high abundance, low toxicity, high selectivity, and excellent reactivity. This minireview summarises the utilisation of chiral p&#8208;block element catalysts for asymmetric reactions to generate value&#8208;added compounds.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Engineered Large&#8208;Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of large&#8208;area continuous COF films with controllable thickness and the patterned growth of films are achieved by solid&#8208;liquid interface engineering. The COF films have high crystalline quality and photoelectrochemical performance. When used as an active material for synaptic devices, they show excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties and successfully simulate biological synaptic functions.







Abstract
Constructing uniform covalent organic framework (COF) film on substrates for electronic devices is highly desirable. Here, a simple and mild strategy is developed to prepare them by polymerization on a solid&#8208;liquid interface. The universality of the method is confirmed by the successful preparation of five COF films with different microstructures. These films have large lateral size, controllable thickness, and high crystalline quality. And COF patterns can also be directly achieved on substrates via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interface engineering, which is in favor of preparing device array. For application studies, the PyTTA&#8208;TPA (PyTTA: 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene and TPA: terephthalaldehyde) COF film has a high photoresponsivity of 59.79&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 at 420&#8197;nm for photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection. When employed as an active material for optoelectronic synaptic devices for the first attempt, it shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties such as short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), and the conversion of STP to LTP, which can be used to simulate biological synaptic functions.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Epoxidation of Alkenes with Near 100&#8201;% Conversion Rate and Selectivity by Regulating Lattice Chlorine Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice Cl&#8722; cyclic process of Co2(OH)3Cl was demonstrated to facilitate photoelectrochemical Cl&#8722; oxidative Cl2 generation in a salt electrolyte. The on&#8208;site produced HClO, by reacting Cl2 with H2O, can be a mediator to oxidize various alkenes to generate the corresponding epoxides with conversion ratios and selectivities of almost 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Directional organic transformation via a green, sustainable catalytic reaction has attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo&#8208;generated charge, where the lattice Cl&#8722; of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo&#8208;generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and be spontaneously recovered by Cl&#8722; of a salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water&#8208;soluble alkenes, including 4&#8208;vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid sodium, and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol can be epoxidized with near 100&#8201;% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl&#8722;MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120&#8197;hours. This work opens an avenue for solar&#8208;driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on&#8208;site reaction around the abundant ocean.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Initiated Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Polythiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Block Copolymer into Erect Micellar Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of polythiophene&#8208;base block copolymer and further decoration of Pt nanoparticles lead to facile construction of highly erect conjugated micellar brushes on various substrates. Moreover, successive patterned immobilization of two types of seed micelles followed by independently surface&#8208;initiated CDSA allows the growth of patterned dual&#8208;micellar brushes on the same substrate.







Abstract
Nanostructured conjugated polymers are of widespread interest due to their broad applications in organic optoelectronic devices, biomedical sensors and other fields. However, the alignment of conjugated nanostructures perpendicular to a surface remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to directly self&#8208;assemble a poly(3&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophene), P3EHT&#8208;based block copolymer into densely aligned micellar brushes through surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The presence of an ethyl pendant on the side group intrinsically moderates the crystallization rate of the polythiophene main chains, and hence favors the controlled living growth of long conjugated fibers and the subsequent fabrication of conjugated micellar brushes. The corona of the micellar brush can be further decorated with platinum nanoparticles, which enables the formation of erect nanoarrays with heights up to 2700&#8197;nm in the dried state. This also renders the micellar brush catalytically active toward hydrogen evolution reaction, which shows a low overpotential of 27&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the P3EHT&#8208;based micellar brush can simultaneously grow with polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PFS&#8208;based micellar brush on the same surface without any significant interference between the two systems. Thus, these two micellar brushes can be patterned through site&#8208;selective immobilization of two types of seeds followed by independent living self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Biopolymer Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry was combined with in&#8208;source fragmentation to visualize fragmentation pathways of biopolymers in a three&#8208;dimensional data domain (Precursor m/z, Product m/z, Intensity). By connecting the experimental points in a stairstep pattern, with the diagonal line where the precursor and product m/z values are equal defining the edge of each stair, the sequence of the biopolymer could be reconstructed.







Abstract
Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in&#8208;source collision&#8208;induced dissociation (IS&#8208;CID) with two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS&#8208;CID is employed as a gas&#8208;phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full&#8208;length polysaccharide or peptide ions prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D&#8208;MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule's MSn scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.

         <title>Massive Molecular Motion in Crystal Leads to an Unexpected Helical Covalent Polymer in a Solid&#8208;state Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactions are attractive due to their greener reaction conditions, and ability to yield unique products. Such reactions are feasible when the reacting groups are pre&#8208;organized in the crystal. We present a crystal that avoids a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement but reacts after a massive molecular motion leading to an unexpected product. This alerts that one has to be cautious in predicting the topochemical reactions based on crystal packing.







Abstract
We designed a proline&#8208;derived monomer with azide and alkene functional groups to enable topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization. In its crystal, the monomer forms supramolecular helices along the &#8216;a&#8217; axis through various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Along the &#8216;c&#8217; axis, the molecules arrange themselves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail in a wave&#8208;like pattern, positioning the azide and alkene groups of adjacent molecules in close proximity and anti&#8208;parallel orientation, complying with Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reaction. This prearranged configuration was expected to facilitate smooth topochemical polymerization, resulting in a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. Upon heating, the monomer underwent TEAC polymerization in a remarkable single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, but, to our surprise, it yielded an unexpected covalent helical polymer linked by 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline units. Remarkably, the crystal avoids the ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement for polymerization, but connects monomer molecules within the supramolecular helix through the cycloaddition of azide and alkene groups, even though they are not in close proximity nor in the expected orientation. This unexpected path, involving a substantial 134&#176; rotation of the alkene group, yields hitherto unknown 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline product regiospecifically. This study serves as a cautionary reminder that relying solely on topochemical postulates for predicting reactivity can sometimes be misleading.

A charge&#8208;accelerated sulfonium rearrangement using simple amides establishes a direct route to sulfenyl imidinium salts, bearing two distinct electrophilic centers and three contiguous stereocenters, formed with high selectivity. Concurrently, access to versatile 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl or sulfonolactone motifs is established.







Abstract
Sulfenyl imidinium salts are a virtually unexplored class of intermediates in organic chemistry. Herein, we demonstrate how sulfonium rearrangements can be deployed to access these versatile synthetic intermediates, bearing three contiguous (and congested) stereogenic centers, with high levels of selectivity. The synthetic value of the scaffold was unraveled by selective transformations into a range of building blocks, including 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives and sulfonolactones.

         <title>Controllable Assembly of Highly Oxidized Cobalt on Graphdiyne Surface for Efficient Conversion of Nitrogen into Nitric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>

Through the incorporation highly oxidized metal species in C(sp)&#8208;rich graphdiyne, nitrogen can selectively and efficiently be converted into *NO, the key intermediate towards nitric acid synthesis. In summary, nitrogen is converted into nitric acid in high yield and good Faraday efficiency







Abstract
The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO3) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO3 from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp&#8208;C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5&#8201;%) were achieved at low potentials.

&lt;p&gt;Through the incorporation highly oxidized metal species in C(sp)-rich graphdiyne, nitrogen can selectively and efficiently be converted into *NO, the key intermediate towards nitric acid synthesis. In summary, nitrogen is converted into nitric acid in high yield and good Faraday efficiency
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp-C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5&#8201;%) were achieved at low potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Characterisation of the sn&#8208;Isomer Lipidome Using High&#8208;Throughput Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition and Ozone&#8208;Induced Dissociation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shotgun lipidomics workflow incorporating data&#8208;independent acquisition and gas&#8208;phase ozonolysis enables characterisation of almost 1000 sn&#8208;resolved PC and PE lipids across four cell lines using an automated analysis pipeline. It reveals that isomer populations are tightly controlled in a cell&#8208;specific manner and enables identification of lipids containing ultralong&#8208;chain monounsaturated fatty acyls predominately at the sn&#8208;1 position.







Abstract
In recent years there has been a significant interest in the development of innovative lipidomics techniques capable of resolving lipid isomers. To date, methods applied to resolving sn&#8208;isomers have resolved only a limited number of species. We report a workflow based on ozone&#8208;induced dissociation for untargeted characterisation of hundreds of sn&#8208;resolved glycerophospholipid isomers from biological extracts in under 20&#8197;min, coupled with an automated data analysis pipeline. It provides an order of magnitude increase in the number of sn&#8208;isomer pairs identified as compared to previous reports and reveals that sn&#8208;isomer populations are tightly regulated and significantly different between cell lines. The sensitivity of this method and potential for de novo molecular discovery is further demonstrated by the identification of unexpected lipids containing ultra&#8208;long monounsaturated acyl chains at the sn&#8208;1 position.

         <title>Iminothioindoxyl Donors with Exceptionally High Cross Section for Protein Vibrational Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To observe site selective vibrational energy transfer (VET) in proteins in ultrafast pump probe experiments, an energy donor is required to inject vibrational energy. The only known donor amino acid azulenylalanine (AzAla) suffers from a low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, two novel iminothioindoxyl (ITI) based donor amino acids were introduced with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient to reach superior VET signal intensities.







Abstract
Various protein functions are related to vibrational energy transfer (VET) as an important mechanism. The underlying transfer pathways can be experimentally followed by ultrafast Vis&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy with a donor&#8208;sensor pair of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated in a protein. However, so far only one donor ncAA, azulenylalanine (AzAla), exists, which suffers from a comparably low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, we introduce two novel donor ncAAs based on an iminothioindoxyl (ITI) chromophore. The dimethylamino&#8208;ITI (DMA&#8208;ITI) and julolidine&#8208;ITI (J&#8208;ITI) moieties overcome the limitation of AzAla with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient. While ITI moieties are known for ultrafast photoswitching, DMA&#8208;ITI and J&#8208;ITI exclusively form a hot ground state on the sub&#8208;ps timescale instead, which is essential for their usage as vibrational energy donor. In VET measurements of donor&#8208;sensor dipeptides we investigate the performance of the new donors. We observe 20 times larger signals compared to the established AzAla donor, which opens unprecedented possibilities for the study of VET in proteins.

         <title>Reversible Postsynthetic Modification in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, reversible covalent postsynthetic modification (PSM) is demonstrated in a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MTV&#8208;MOF) using thermoreversible furan&#8208;maleimide Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry. The MOF was modified with a pendant furan functional group that was then capable of undergoing repeated cycles of PSM and de&#8208;modification with different functionalized maleimides. Reversible PSM was achieved with complete retention of structural integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of the MOF.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provides access to functional materials and advanced porous solid engineering. Herein, we report the reversible PSM of a multivariate isoreticular MOF by applying dynamic furan&#8208;maleimide Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) chemistry. The key step involves incorporating a furan group into the MOF via &#8220;click&#8221; PSM, which can then undergo repeated cycles of modification and de&#8208;modification with maleimides. The structural integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of the furan&#8208;appended MOF remained intact even after three consecutive PSM/de&#8208;modification cycles using three different functionalized maleimides.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Incarnatapeptins A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and the unusual use of silver carbonate to promote N&#8208;acylation, the first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B has been achieved, which unambiguously confirmed the structure of these natural products.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B, two novel marine natural products, was accomplished from readily available (S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyloxycarbonylhexahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid. This route, whose longest linear sequence was 12 steps, provided the incarnatapeptins A and B in yields of 26.5&#8201;% and 19.7&#8201;%, respectively, and enabled the structure and stereochemistry of both natural products to be unambiguously confirmed. Highlights of our synthesis include the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and a novel and practical N&#8208;acylation paradigm promoted by silver carbonate. The unusual facile atropisomerism of some linear peptidic intermediates was also observed by TLC analysis in the course of this work.

         <title>Towards a Light&#8208;mediated Gene Therapy for the Eye using Caged Ethinylestradiol and the Inducible Cre/lox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light sensitive caged ethinylestradiol (EE2) was used in combination with the inducible Cre/lox system for photoactivated transgene expression in the living eye. Following intravitreal injection of caged EE2 and irradiation with light at 450&#8197;nm, tdTomato reporter gene expression was robustly induced in retinal tissue.







Abstract

Photoactivation significantly increased retinal tdTomato expression compared to controls. We thus demonstrated a first step towards the development of a targeted, light&#8208;mediated gene therapy for the eyes.

&lt;p&gt;A blue light sensitive caged ethinylestradiol (EE2) was used in combination with the inducible Cre/lox system for photoactivated transgene expression in the living eye. Following intravitreal injection of caged EE2 and irradiation with light at 450&#8197;nm, tdTomato reporter gene expression was robustly induced in retinal tissue.

         <title>Immobilized Tetraalkylammonium Cations Enable Metal&#8208;free CO2 Electroreduction in Acid and Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively charged polyelectrolyte formed by the electrostatic interaction between poly(diallydimethylammonium)and graphene oxide is devised on the surface of Ag catalysts. This porous medium with immobilized cations augments CO2 electroreduction to CO in acid&#8208; and pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration. Performing CO2RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present&#8208;day acid&#8208;fed membrane electrode assemblies. Herein, we present a strategy using a positively charged polyelectrolyte&#8212;poly(diallyldimethylammonium) immobilized on graphene oxide via electrostatic interactions to displace alkali cations. This enables a FE of 85&#8201;%, a carbon efficiency of 93&#8201;%, and an energy efficiency (EE) of 35&#8201;% for CO at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on modified Ag catalysts in acid. In a pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed reactor, we obtained a 78&#8201;% CO FE with a 30&#8201;% EE at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. All the performance metrics are comparable to or even exceed those attained in the presence of alkali metal cations.

         <title>Tandem Synergistic Effect of Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites Confined on the Edge of Monolayer CuInP2S6 toward Selective Photoreduction of CO2 into Multi&#8208;Carbon Solar Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem synergistic effect of charge&#8208;enriched Cu&#8722;In dual sites confined on the edge of CuInP2S6 ML triggers C&#8722;C coupling, facilitating the dominant generation of C2H4. The marginal In site of ML preeminently targets CO2 conversion to *CO under light illumination, and the *CO then migrate to the neighbor Cu sites for the subsequent C&#8722;C coupling reaction into C2H4 with thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility.







Abstract
One&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, single&#8208;crystal, hexagonal CuInP2S6 atomically thin sheets of&#8776;0.81&#8197;nm in thickness was successfully synthesized for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Exciting ethene (C2H4) as the main product was dominantly generated with the yield&#8208;based selectivity reaching &#8776;56.4&#8201;%, and the electron&#8208;based selectivity as high as &#8776;74.6&#8201;%. The tandem synergistic effect of charge&#8208;enriched Cu&#8722;In dual sites confined on the lateral edge of the CuInP2S6 monolayer (ML) is mainly responsible for efficient conversion and high selectivity of the C2H4 product as the basal surface site of the ML, exposing S atoms, can not derive the CO2 photoreduction due to the high energy barrier for the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of CO2 into *COOH. The marginal In site of the ML preeminently targets CO2 conversion to *CO under light illumination, and the *CO then migrates to the neighbor Cu sites for the subsequent C&#8722;C coupling reaction into C2H4 with thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. Moreover, ultrathin structure of the ML also allows to shorten the transfer distance of charge carriers from the interior onto the surface, thus inhibiting electron&#8208;hole recombination and enabling more electrons to survive and accumulate on the exposed active sites for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Iodinated Electron Acceptor with Significantly Extended Exciton Diffusion Length for Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodination in organic solar cell molecule yields a breakthrough with the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor BO&#8208;4I, delivering expanded exciton diffusion, improved intra&#8208;moiety excitation, and unprecedentedly low non&#8208;radiative losses, propelling photovoltaic efficiency forward.







Abstract
Iodination has unlocked new potentials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A newly designed and synthesized iodinated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, showcases exceptional excitation delocalization property with the exciton diffusion length increased to 80&#8197;nm. The enhanced electron delocalization property is attributed to the larger atomic radius and electron orbit of the iodine atom, which facilitates the formation of intra&#8208;moiety excitations in the acceptor phase. This effectively circumvents the charge transfer state&#8208;related recombination mechanisms, leading to a substantial reduction in non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). As a result, OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BO&#8208;4I achieves an impressive efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% with a notable &#916;Enr of 0.189&#8197;eV, markedly surpassing their fluorinated counterparts. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of iodination in reducing energy loss, thereby affirming its potential as a key strategy in the development of advanced next&#8208;generation OPV cells.

         <title>Helicoselective Synthesis of Indolohelicenoids through Organocatalytic Central&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Chirality Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition&#8208;elimination cascade reaction was developed to access chiral azahelicenoid skeletons. This convergent approach offers an organocatalytic helicoselective route to obtain indolohelicenoids with high enantioselectivity. The prepared indolohelicenoids display positive photophysical and chiroptical properties, showcasing their potential utility in organic photoelectric materials.







Abstract
We report the helicoselective and convergent construction of indolohelicenoids with excellent efficiency and stereocontrol. This reaction proceeds through a chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition and eliminative aromatization sequence, which can be finely controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral phosphoric acid cooperatively serves as both a bifunctional and Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, enabling one&#8208;pot central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion. Additionally, the optical properties of the synthesized indolohelicenoids were characterized to explore their potential applications in organic photoelectric materials.

This reaction proceeds through a chiral-phosphoric-acid-catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition and eliminative aromatization sequence, which can be finely controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral phosphoric acid cooperatively serves as both a bifunctional and Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, enabling one-pot central-to-helical chirality conversion. Additionally, the optical properties of the synthesized indolohelicenoids were characterized to explore their potential applications in organic photoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lateral Heterometal Junction Rectifier Fabricated by Sequential Transmetallation of Coordination Nanosheet
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lateral heterojunction, fabricated by spatially confined transmetallation of a precursor zinc(II) benzenehexathiolato coordination nanosheet with Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions is reported. Structural differences between the transmetallated and the as&#8208;prepared nanosheets lead to physical and chemical differences. Band structure bending across the interface of the transmetallated nanosheets results in the observed rectifying behavior.







Abstract
Heterostructures of two&#8208;dimensional materials realise novel and enhanced physical phenomena, making them attractive research targets. Compared to inorganic materials, coordination nanosheets have virtually infinite combinations, leading to tunability of physical properties and are promising candidates for heterostructure fabrication. Although stacking of coordination materials into vertical heterostructures is widely reported, reports of lateral coordination material heterostructures are few. Here we show the successful fabrication of a seamless lateral heterojunction showing diode behaviour, by sequential and spatially limited immersion of a new metalladithiolene coordination nanosheet, Zn3BHT, into aqueous Cu(II) and Fe(II) solutions. Upon immersion, the Zn centres in insulating Zn3BHT are replaced by Cu or Fe ions, resulting in conductivity. The transmetallation is spatially confined, occurring only within the immersed area. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point towards exploring transmetallation of various two&#8208;dimensional materials to produce lateral heterojunctions, by providing a new and facile synthetic route.

         <title>Vinylogous Urea&#8212;Urethane Vitrimers: Accelerating and Inhibiting Network Dynamics through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, vinylogous urea (VUN) groups undergo much faster bond exchange than vinylogous urethanes (VUO), but this is not observed in their respective polymer networks. Surprisingly, blends of the two monomer types show increased network dynamics. The effects are correlated to hydrogen bonding, which catalyses covalent exchange and also reinforces networks by non&#8208;covalent interactions.







Abstract
Vinylogous urethane (VUO) based polymer networks are widely used as catalyst&#8208;free vitrimers that show rapid covalent bond exchange at elevated temperatures. In solution, vinylogous ureas (VUN) undergo much faster bond exchange than VUO and are highly dynamic at room temperature. However, this difference in reactivity is not observed in their respective dynamic polymer networks, as VUO and VUN vitrimers prepared herein with very similar macromolecular architectures show comparable stress relaxation and creep behavior. However, by using mixtures of VUO and VUN linkages within the same network, the dynamic reactions can be accelerated by an order of magnitude. The results can be rationalized by the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is absent in VUO vitrimers, but is very pronounced for vinylogous urea moieties. At low concentrations of VUN, these hydrogen bonds act as catalysts for covalent bond exchange, while at high concentration, they provide a pervasive vinylogous urea &#8208; urethane (VU) network of strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, giving rise to phase separation and inhibiting polymer chain dynamics. This offers a straightforward design principle for dynamic polymer materials, showing at the same time the possible additive and synergistic effects of supramolecular and dynamic covalent polymer networks.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Trace Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Rate and Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives are inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, which implements a dual remodeling effect on Zn2+ solvation shell and Zn surface molecules, facilitating long&#8208;term stable and high&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion batteries at ultra&#8208;low temperatures.







Abstract
High&#8208;rate and stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries working at low temperatures are highly desirable for practical applications, but are challenged by sluggish kinetics and severe corrosion. Herein, inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, we report trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives that implement a dual remodeling effect for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The additive with high Zn absorbability not only remodels Zn2+ primary solvent shell by alternating H2O molecules, but also forms a shielding layer thus remodeling the Zn surface, which effectively enhances fast Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation reaction kinetics and prohibits Zn anode corrosion. Taking trace &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (&#945;DG) as a demonstration, the electrolyte obtains a low freezing point of &#8722;55.3&#8201;&#176;C, and the Zn//Zn cell can stably cycle for 2000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C, with a high cumulative capacity of 5000&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A full battery that stably operates for 10000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is also demonstrated.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Boosted Active Hydrogen on Copper for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is a promising approach in term of pollutant appreciation. Cu&#8208;based catalysts performs a leading&#8208;edge advantage for nitrate reduction due to its favorable adsorption with *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surface is difficult and insufficient, leading to the significant generation of by&#8208;product NO2&#8208;. Herein, sulphur doped Cu (Cu&#8208;S) is prepared via an electrochemical conversion strategy and used for nitrate electroreduction. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia (~98.3%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (~1.4%) are achieved on Cu&#8208;S, obviously superior to its counterpart of Cu (FENH3: 70.4%, FENO2&#8208;: 18.8%). Electrochemical in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that a small amount of S doping on Cu surface can promote the kinetics of H2O dissociation to active hydrogen. The optimized hydrogen affinity validly decreases the hydrogenation kinetic energy barrier of *NO2, leading to an enhanced NH3 selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;coordination Nanocrystalline Copper&#8208;based Catalysts through Theory&#8208;guided Electrochemical Restructuring for Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Revealing the dynamic reconstruction process and tailoring advanced copper (Cu) catalysts is of paramount significance for promoting the conversion of CO2 into ethylene (C2H4), paving the way for carbon neutralization and facilitating renewable energy storage. In this study, we initially employed density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the restructuring behavior of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions and delineated its restructuring patterns. Leveraging insights into this restructuring behavior, we devised an efficient, low&#8208;coordination copper&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting synthesized catalyst demonstrated an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70% for ethylene generation at a current density of 800 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, it showed robust stability, maintaining consistent performance for 230 hours at a cell voltage of 3.5 V in a full&#8208;cell system. Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts but also advances CO2 electrolysis technologies for industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>Multielectron Redox&#8208;Bipolar Tetranitroporphyrin Macrocycle Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipolar organics fuse the merits of n/p&#8208;type redox reactions for better Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs), but face the capacity plafond due to low density of active units and single&#8208;electron reactions. Here we report multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin (TNP) with quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties towards high&#8208;capacity&#8208;voltage ZOBs. TNP cathode initiates high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8722;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage involving four nitro sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential and two amine species coupling with SO42&#8722; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338 mAh g&#8722;1), boosted average voltage (1.08 V), and outstanding energy density (365 Wh kg&#8722;1TNP). Moreover, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 with 71.6% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar organics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Formamidinium Lead Iodide&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25% Enabled by An Amphiphilic Molecular Hole&#8208;Transporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) represents an optimal absorber material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the application of FAPbI3 in inverted&#8208;structured PSCs has yet to be successful, mainly owing to its inferior film&#8208;forming on hydrophobic or defective hole&#8208;transporting substrates. Herein, we report a substantial improvement of FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, which is realized by a multifunctional amphiphilic molecular hole&#8208;transporter, (2&#8208;(4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (PTZ&#8208;CPA). The phenothiazine (PTZ) based PTZ&#8208;CPA, carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid (CPA) group, forms a superwetting hole&#8208;selective underlayer that enables facile deposition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 thin films. Compared to a previously established carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective material (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI3 is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ&#8208;CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four&#8208;fold) and Shockley&#8208;Read&#8208;Hall lifetime (eight&#8208;fold). Moreover, the PTZ&#8208;CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI3, benefiting the interfacial hole&#8208;collection. Consequently, FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ&#8208;CPA based device shows commendable long&#8208;term stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40oC for 2000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ and Real&#8208;time Monitoring the Chemical and Thermal Evolution of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;capacity Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for fabrication of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, thermal runaway of LIBs with these cathodes leads to great safety concerns. In this study, single crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) has been prepared and a flexible optical fiber was buried inside the pouch&#8208;type LIBs with NCM&#8208;SC cathode to in&#8208;situ study its real&#8208;time temperature evolution during charge/discharge process. NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an enhanced Li+ ions transportation efficiency and electrode reaction kinetics, which can effectively reduce the generation of polarization heat and mitigate the internal temperature rise of the pouch&#8208;type battery. Meanwhile, solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) film decomposition and gas accumulation are effectively alleviated, due to the enhanced thermal stability of SEI film formed on NCM&#8208;SC. Moreover, the single crystal architecture can effectively retard layered to spinal and rock&#8208;salt phase transition, mitigate the crack formation and structural collapse. Consequently, NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance and enhanced thermal stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Delocalization Engineering of Heme&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Enzymes for Augmented Reactive Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related catalysis has broad applicability. Herein, inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, we report the synthesis of polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) as a new porphyrin&#8208;evolving structure to serve as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to the structural advantages, such as enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8208;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS&#8208;production activity in terms of Vmax and turnover numbers as compared with porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPor&#8208;AE), which also surpassed reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art artificial enzymes in their activity. More interestingly, by changing the reaction medium and substrates, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE also revealed significantly improved activity and environmental adaptivity in many other ROS&#8208;related biocatalytic processes, validating the potential of Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE to replace conventional (poly)porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics for ROS&#8208;related catalysis, biosensors, or biotherapeutics. It is suggested that this study will offer essential guidance for designing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Chiroptical Responses in Helical Nanographenes via Geometric&#160;Engineering of Double [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical nanographenes with high quantum yields and strong chiroptical responses are pivotal for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Here, we present the successful synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;extended double [7]helicenes (ED7Hs) where two helicene units are fused at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively, as the structural isomers of the reported ortho&#8208;fused ED7H. The structural geometry&#160;of these ED7Hs is clearly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Notably, this class of ED7Hs exhibits bright luminescence with high quantum yields exceeding 40%. Through geometric&#160;regulation of two embedded [7]helicene units from ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; to para&#8208;position, these ED7Hs display exceptional amplification in chiroptical responses. This enhancement is evident in a remarkable approximate fivefold increase in the absorbance and luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs and glum), respectively, along with a boosted CPL brightness up to 176 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1, surpassing the performance of most helicene&#8208;based chiral NGs. Furthermore, DFT calculations elucidate that the geometric&#160;adjustment of two [7]helicene units allows the precise alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, leading to the observed enhancement of their chiroptical responses. This study offers an effective strategy for magnifying the CPL performance in chiral NGs, promoting their expanded application as CPL emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Phase Mixing Degree in Promoting C&#8208;C Coupling in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction on Cu&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been identified as the most promising candidates for generation of C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Defect engineering in catalysts is a widely employed strategy for promoting C&#8208;C coupling on Cu. However, comprehensive understanding of defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship has not been obtained. In this study, controllable defects generation is achieved, which leads to a series of Cu&#8208;based catalysts with various phase mixing degrees. It is observed that the Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products increases with the phase mixing degree, reaching 81% at maximum. In&#8208;situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the catalysts with higher phase mixing degree tend to form *CO more easily and possess higher retention of *CO under high overpotential window, thereby promoting C&#8208;C coupling. This work sheds new light on the relationship between defects and C&#8208;C coupling, and the rational developed of more advanced Cu&#8208;base catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Polymer Electrolyte in MOF for Safe and High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfined polymer molecules exhibit profound transformations in their properties and behaviors. Here, we present the synthesis of a polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSMBs). The unique nanoconfinement effectively weakens Na ion coordination with the polymer matrix, enhancing the Na ion dissociation&#160;kinetics. Simultaneously, the well&#8208;defined nanopores within ZIF&#8208;8 particles serve as nanoconfined ion migration channels, enabling rapid Na ion transport. As a result, this pioneering design enables the solid polymer electrolyte to achieve remarkable metrics, including a Na ion transference number of 0.87, Na ion conductivity of 4.01&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1, and an extended electrochemical voltage window up to 4.8 V vs. Na/Na+ at 80 &#176;C. The assembled SSMBs (with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode) exhibit dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, promising rate capability, and stable cycling performance with 96% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 80 &#176;C. This innovative polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF design offers a compelling strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance and safe solid&#8208;state metal battery technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Disassembly of Molecular Motor&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers Revealed by High Speed&#8208;AFM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers have a major potential for applications in responsive materials that are externally triggered by light with spatio&#8208;temporal control of their polymerisation state. While changes in macroscopic properties revealed the adaptive nature of these materials, it remains challenging to capture the dynamic depolymerisation process at the molecular level, which requires fast observation techniques combined with in situ irradiation. By implementing in situ UV illumination into a High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscope (HS&#8208;AFM) setup, we have been able to capture the disassembly of a light&#8208;driven molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymer. The real&#8208;time visualisation of the light&#8208;triggered disassembly process not only reveals cooperative depolymerisation, it also shows that this process continues after illumination is halted. Combining the data with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and spectroscopy approaches, we obtain a molecular&#8208;level description of the motor&#8208;based polymer dynamics reminiscent of actin chain&#8208;end depolymerisation. Our detailed understanding of supramolecular depolymerisation will drive the development of future responsive polymer systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia: State of the Catalyst During Reaction and Deactivation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia synthesis holds significant importance for both agricultural fertilizer production and emerging green energy applications. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of a catalyst for mechanochemical ammonia synthesis, based on Cs&#8208;promoted Fe. The study sheds light on the catalyst's dynamic evolution under reaction conditions and the origin of deactivation. Initially, elemental Cs converts to CsH, followed by partial CsOH formation due to trace oxygen impurities on the surface of the Fe metal and the equipment. Concurrently, the mechanical milling process comminutes Fe, exposing fresh metallic Fe surfaces. This comminution correlates with an induction period observed during ammonia formation. Critical to the study, degradation of active Cs promoter species (CsH and CsNH2) into inactive CsOH emerged as the primary deactivation mechanism. By increasing the Cs content from 2.2 mol% to 4.2 mol%, we achieved stable, continuous ammonia synthesis for nearly 90 hours, showcasing one of the longest&#8208;running mechanocatalytic gas phase reactions. Studies of the temperature dependence of the reaction revealed negligible bulk temperature influence in the range of &#8208;10&#176;C to 100&#176;C, highlighting the dominance of mechanical action over bulk thermal effects. This study offers insights into the complex interplay between mechanical processing, reactive species, and deactivation mechanisms in mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Sesterterpene Synthases from Lentzea atacamensis Demonstrate the Role of Conformational Variability in Terpene Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mining of two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases from Lentzea atacamensis resulted in the identification of the synthases for lentzeadiene (LaLDS) and atacamatriene (LaATS). The main product of LaLDS (lentzeadiene) is a new compound, while one of the side products (lentzeatetraene) is the enantiomer of brassitetraene B and the other side product (sestermobaraene F) is known from a surprisingly distantly related sesterterpene synthase. LaATS produces six new compounds, one of which is the enantiomer of the known sesterterpene Bm1. Notably, for both enzymes the products cannot all be explained from one and the same starting conformation of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating the requirement of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the enzymes&#8217; active sites. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was discovered, reminiscent of the biosynthesis of vitamin D3. All enzyme reactions and the [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results also emphasize the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of Borolithochromes A, D and G</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, the red pigments isolated from fossils of Jurassic putative red alga Solenopora jurassica, have&#160;been achieved. The benzo[gh]tetraphene skeletons of the borate ligands in these substances were constructed using Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of aryl dienes with naphthoquinone followed by intramolecular Corey&#8208;Chaykovsky reactions. Complexation of these ligands with trimethyl borate generated homo&#8208;complexes, which upon sequential O&#8208;demethylation produced borolithochromes A and G. In the route to borolithochrome D, a hetero&#8208;complex was prepared by stepwise complexation of the ligand with 2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl dimethyl borate. The strategy devised to accomplish the first total synthesis of borolithochromes A, D and G should be applicable to the preparation of other borolithochromes as well as spiroborates possessing two fused poly&#8208;aromatic ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;based Linker Strategy for Selective Activation of Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Existing antibody&#8210;drug conjugate (ADC) linkers, whether cleavable linkers or non&#8208;cleavable linkers, are designed to release highly toxic payloads or payload derivatives once ADCs are internalised into cells. However, clinical studies have shown that only &lt;1% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in tumour cells. The remaining &gt;99% of ADCs are nonspecifically distributed in healthy tissue cells, thus inevitably leading to off&#8208;target toxicities of ADCs. Herein, we describe an intelligent tumour&#8208;specific linker strategy to address these limitations. A tumour&#8208;specific linker is constructed by introducing a hypoxia&#8208;activated azobenzene group as a toxicity controller. We show that this azobenzene&#8208;based linker is non&#8208;cleavable in healthy tissues (O2 &gt;10%), and the corresponding payload derivative, amino acid appendage Cysteine&#160;(Cys)&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;linker&#8208;monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), can serve as a safe prodrug to mask the toxicities of MMAE (switched off). Upon exposure to hypoxic tumour microenvironment (O2 &lt;1%), this linker is cleaved to release MMAE and fully restores the high cytotoxicity of the ADC (switched on). Notably, azobenzene&#8208;linker containing ADC exhibits satisfactory antitumour efficacy in vivo and a much better therapeutic window compared with the traditional cleavable linkers or non&#8208;cleavable linkers containing ADCs. Thus, our azobenzene&#8208;based linkers shed new light on the development of next&#8208;generation ADC linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Robust MOF for Challenging Ethylene Purification and Propylene Recovery with Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene (C2H4) purification and propylene (C3H6) recovery are highly relevant in polymer synthesis, yet developing physisorbents for these industrial separation faces the challenges of merging easy scalability, economic feasibility, high moisture stability with great separation efficiency. Herein, we reported a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) for simultaneous recovery of C3H6 and C2H4. Through creating nonpolar pores decorated by accessible N/O sites, MAC&#8208;4 displays top&#8208;tier uptakes and selectivities for C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4 at ambient conditions. Molecular modelling combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy revealed that C2H6 and C3H6 molecules were trapped in the framework with stronger contacts relative to C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated exceptional separation performance for binary C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 as well as ternary C3H6/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, simultaneously affording record productivities of 27.4 and 36.2 L kg&#8208;1 for high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&#8805; 99.9%) and C3H6 (&#8805; 99.5%). MAC&#8208;4 was facilely prepared at deckgram&#8208;scale under reflux condition within 3 hours, making it as a smart MOF to address challenging gas separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Transpassive Metal Dissolution vs. Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Implication for Alloy Stability and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) are gaining interest in corrosion and electrocatalysis research due to their electrochemical stability across&#160;a broad&#160;pH range and the design flexibility they offer. Using the equimolar CrCoNi alloy, we observe significant metal dissolution in a corrosive electrolyte (0.1 M NaCl, pH 2) concurrently with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the transpassive region despite the absence of hysteresis in polarization curves or other obvious corrosion indicators. We present a characterization scheme to delineate the contribution of OER and alloy dissolution, using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for&#160;OER&#8208;onset detection, and quantitative chemical analysis with inductively coupled&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and ultraviolet visible light (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy to elucidate metal dissolution processes. In&#8208;situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM) revealed that the transpassive metal dissolution on CrCoNi is dominated by intergranular corrosion. These results have significant implications for the stability of MPEAs in corrosion systems, emphasizing the necessity&#160;of analytically determining&#160;metal ions released from MPEA electrodes into the electrolyte when evaluating Faradaic efficiencies of OER catalysts. The release of transition metal ions not only reduces&#160;the Faradaic efficiency of electrolyzers but may also cause poisoning and degradation of membranes in electrochemical reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Based Photoenzymatic Nanoreactor for Asymmetric Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;catalysis represents a highly efficient and stereoselective method for the synthesis of valuable chiral compounds, however, the poor stability and limited reaction types of free enzymes restrict their wide application in industrial production. In this work, to overcome these problems, a multifunctional photoenzymatic nanoreactor CALB@COF&#8208;Ir was developed through the encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) in a photosensitive covalent organic framework COF&#8208;Ir. This bio&#8208;nanocluster serves as efficient catalysts in asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The well&#8208;designed COF&#8208;Ir not only acts as safety cover to prevent CALB from deactivation but promotes racemization of secondary amines via photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. Photoelectric characterization and TDDFT calculation revealed that (ppy)2Ir units in COF&#8208;Ir play crucial role in this photocatalytic system which enhance its photo&#8208;redox properties through facilitating the separation between photoelectrons (e&#8208;) and holes (h+). Furthermore, the heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor could be recycled for five rounds with slight decline of catalytic reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>An SN2 Reaction&#160;at Amide Nitrogen Enables Hydrazide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic substitutions are fundamentally important transformations in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite the substantial advances in bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions (SN2) at saturated carbon centers, analogous SN2 reaction at the amide nitrogen atom remains extremely limited. Here we report an SN2 substitution method at the amide nitrogen atom with amine nucleophiles for nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bond formation that leads to a novel strategy toward biologically and medicinally important hydrazide derivatives. We found the use of sulfonate&#8208;leaving groups at the amide nitrogen atom played a pivotal role in the reaction. This new N&#8722;N coupling reaction allows the use of O&#8208;tosyl hydroxamates as electrophiles and readily available amines, including acyclic aliphatic amines and saturated N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples), excellent functional group tolerability, and scalability. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of various approved drug molecules, thus enabling complex hydrazide scaffold syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation and Transfer Hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Nitrones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their distinctive 1,3&#8208;dipolar structure, the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of nitrones to hydroxylamines has been a formidable and longstanding challenge, characterized by intricate enantiocontrol and susceptibility to N&#8208;O bond cleavage. In this study, the asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of nitrones were accomplished with a tethered TsDPEN&#8208;derived cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) catalyst (TsDPEN: p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), the reaction proceeds via a novel 7&#8208;membered cyclic transition state, producing chiral hydroxylamines with up to 99% yield and &gt;99% ee. The practical viability of this methodology was underscored by gram&#8208;scale catalytic reactions and subsequent transformations. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were also conducted to elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Sortase&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Domain Inversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological transformations and permutations of proteins have attracted significant interest as strategies to generate new protein functionalities or stability. These efforts have mainly been inspired by naturally occurring post&#8208;translational modifications, such as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization, circular permutation, or lasso&#8208;like entanglement. Such approaches can be facilitated via genetic encoding, in the case of circular permutation, or via enzymatic processing, in the case of cyclization. Notably, these previously described strategies leave the polypeptide backbone orientation unaltered. Here we describe an unnatural protein permutation, the protein domain inversion, whereby a C&#8208;terminal portion of a protein is enzymatically inverted from the canonical N&#8208;to&#8208;C to a C&#8208;to&#8208;C configuration with respect to the N&#8208;terminal part of the protein. The closest conceptually analogous biological process is perhaps the inversion of DNA segments as catalyzed by recombinases. We achieve these inversions using an engineered sortase A, a widely used transpeptidase. Our reactions proceed efficiently under mild conditions at 4&#8208;25&#176;C and are compatible with entirely heterologously&#8208;produced protein substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating and Identifying the Active Site of RuS2 for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching for highly efficient and economical electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the development of the alkaline polymer membrane fuel cells (APMFCs). Here, we report a valid strategy to active pyrite&#8208;type RuS2 for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis by introducing sulfur vacancies. The obtained S&#8208;vacancies modified RuS2&#8208;x exhibits outperformed HOR activity with current density of 0.676 mA cm&#8208;2 and mass activity of 1.43 mA &#956;g&#8208;1, which are 15&#8208;fold and 40&#8208;fold improvement than those of Ru catalyst. In situ Raman spectra demonstrates the formation of S&#8208;H bond during the HOR process, identifying the S atom of RuS2&#8208;x is the real active site for HOR catalysis. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results including in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared adsorption spectroscopy suggest the introduction of S vacancies can rationally modify the p orbital of S atoms, leading to enhanced binding strength between the S sites and H atoms on the surface of RuS2&#8208;x, together with the promoted connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and lowered water formation energy, contributes to the enhanced HOR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Cu Plates with Steady Fluid Fields for High&#8208;rate Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia and Efficient Zn&#8211;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8208;RR) to ammonia (NH3) provides a promising strategy for nitrogen utilization, while achieving high selectivity and durability at an industrial scale has remained challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that the performance of eNO3&#8208;RR could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8208;RR setup provided superior&#160;NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99%, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis for 120 h at 200 mA cm&#8722;2, and a record&#8208;high yield rate of 3.14 mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the proposed strategy was successfully extended to the Zn&#8208;nitrate battery system, providing a power density of 12.09 mW cm&#8722;2 and NH3 FE of 85.4%, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eNO3&#8208;RR catalysts. Coupled with the COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, the main contributor for the high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production could be the steady fluid field to timely rejuvenate the electrocatalyst surface during the electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphitic Armor: A Natural Molecular Sieve for Robust Hydrogen Electroxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon coating layers have been found to improve the catalytic performance of transition metals, which is usually explained as an outcome of electronic synergistic effect. Herein we reveal that the defective graphitic carbon, with a unique interlayer gap of 0.342 nm, can be a highly selective natural molecular sieve. It allows efficient diffusion of hydrogen molecules or radicals both along the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, but sterically hinders the diffusion of molecules with larger kinetic diameter (e.g., CO and O2) along the in&#8208;plane direction. As a result, poisonous species lager than 0.342 nm are sieved out, even when their adsorption on the metal is thermodynamically strong; at the same time, the interaction between H2 and the metal is not affected. This natural molecular sieve provides a very chance for constructing robust metal catalysts for hydrogen&#8208;relevant processes, which are more tolerant to chemical or electrochemical oxidation or CO&#8208;relevant poisoning.</dc:description>

It allows efficient diffusion of hydrogen molecules or radicals both along the in-plane and out-of-plane direction, but sterically hinders the diffusion of molecules with larger kinetic diameter (e.g., CO and O2) along the in-plane direction. As a result, poisonous species lager than 0.342 nm are sieved out, even when their adsorption on the metal is thermodynamically strong; at the same time, the interaction between H2 and the metal is not affected. This natural molecular sieve provides a very chance for constructing robust metal catalysts for hydrogen-relevant processes, which are more tolerant to chemical or electrochemical oxidation or CO-relevant poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with High&#8208;Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Li3MX6 compounds (M = Sc, Y, In; X = Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high&#8208;pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group P63mc with hexagonal close&#8208;packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient&#8208;pressure a&#8208;Li3ScCl6 and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li3MX6 family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, rM/rX, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the rM/rX threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp&#8208;to&#8208;hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Aza[5]helicene&#8208;Derived Semiconducting Polymers for Improved Performance in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exploring Energetic and Morphological Influences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategic design of solution&#8208;processable semiconducting polymers possessing both matched energy levels and elevated glass transition temperatures is of urgent importance in the progression of thermally robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 25%. In this work, we employed direct arylation polymerization to achieve the high&#8208;yield synthesis of three aza[5]helicene&#8208;derived copolymers with distinct HOMO energy levels and exceptional glass transition temperatures. Upon integration of these semiconducting polymers into formamidinium lead triiodide&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, marked disparities in photovoltaic parameters manifest, primarily stemming from variations in the electrical conductivity and film morphology of the hole transport layers. The p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E copolymer, featuring a conjugated main chain comprising alternating repeats of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, phenoxazine, and ethylenedioxythiophene, attains an initial average efficiency of 25.5%, markedly surpassing reference materials such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (23.0%), PTAA (17.0%), and P3HT (11.6%). Notably, p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E exhibits a high cohesive energy density, resulting in enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, thereby conferring perovskite solar cells with exceptional 85&#176;C tolerance and operational stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Charge Transfer Process and Photocatalytic Activity over a Phosphonate&#8208;based MOF via Amorphization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, amorphous materials have gained great attention as an emerging kind of functional material, and their characteristics such as isotropy, absence of grain boundaries, and abundant defects are very likely to outrun the disadvantages of crystalline counterparts, such as low conductivity, and ultimately lead to improved charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we investigated the effect of amorphization on the charge transfer process and photocatalytic performance with a phosphonate&#8208;based metal organic framework (FePPA) as the research object. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that compared to crystalline FePPA, amorphous FePPA has more distorted metal nodes, which affects the electron distribution and consequently improves the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the distorted metal nodes in amorphous FePPA also greatly promote the adsorption and activation of O2. Hence, amorphous FePPA exhibits a better performance of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;H bond activation for selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. This work illustrates the advantages of amorphous MOFs in the charge transfer process, which is conducive to the further development of high performance MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Oxygen&#8208;Independent Augmented Photodynamic Oncotherapy by Facilitating the Separation of Electron&#8208;Hole Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) caused by the inherent oxygen consumption of traditional Type&#8208;II PDT and anoxic tumor microenvironment. The challenge for the exploration of Type&#8208;I PSs is to facilitate the electron transfer ability of photosensitization molecules for transforming oxygen or H2O to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we propose an electronic acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer (a&#8208;PET) strategy promoting the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs by marriage of two organic semiconducting molecules of a non&#8208;fullerene scaffold&#8208;based photosensitizer and a perylene diimide that significantly boost the Type&#8208;I PDT pathway to produce plentiful ROS, especially, inducing 3.5&#8208;fold and 2.5&#8208;fold amplification of hydroxyl (OH&#8226;) and superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8226;) generation. Systematic mechanism exploration reveals that intermolecular electron transfer and intramolecular charge separation after photoirradiation generate a competent production of radical ion pairs that promote the Type&#8208;I PDT process by theoretical calculation and ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy. By complementary tumor diagnosis with photoacoustic imaging and second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, this as&#8208;prepared nanoplatform exhibits fabulous photocytotoxicity in hypoxic tumor model of mice. We envision that this work will broaden the insight into high&#8208;efficiency Type&#8208;I PDT for cancer phototheranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Layered Stacking of a Covalent Triazine Framework Membrane for Aromatic/Aliphatic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane separation of aromatics and aliphatics is a crucial requirement in chemical and petroleum industries. However, this task presents a significant challenge due to the lack of membrane materials that can endure harsh solvents, exhibit molecular specificity, and facilitate easy processing. Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate a covalent triazine framework (CTF) membrane by employing a mix&#8208;monomer strategy. By incorporating a spatial monomer alongside a planar monomer, we were able to subtly modulate both the pore aperture and membrane affinity, enabling preferential permeation of aromatics over aliphatics with molecular weight below 200 Dalton (Da). Consequently, we achieved successful all&#8208;liquid phase separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. Our investigation revealed that the synergistic effects of size sieving and the affinity between the permeating molecules and the membrane played a pivotal role in separating these closely resembling species. Furthermore, the membrane exhibited remarkable robustness under practical operating conditions, including prolonged operation time, various feed compositions, different applied pressure, and multiple feed components. This versatile strategy offers a feasible approach to fabricate membranes with molecule selectivity toward aromatic/aliphatic mixtures, taking a significant step forward in addressing the grand challenge of separating small organic molecules through membrane technology.</dc:description>

         <title>A non&#8208;metal single atom nanozyme for cutting off the energy and reducing the power of tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes are considered safe and effective therapeutic tools for various diseases. With the increasing integration of biomedicine and nanotechnology, artificial nanozymes offer advanced controllability and functionality in medical design. However, several notable gaps, such as catalytic diversity, specificity and biosafety, still exist between nanozymes and their native counterparts. Here we report a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE), which exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimetic activity. This novel single atom nanozyme provides a safe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts and effectively cuts off the cellular energy and reduction equivalents through its distinctive catalytic function in tumors. In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase&#8208;like activity of the non&#8208;metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.</dc:description>

In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase-like activity of the non-metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated MOF&#8208;Based Hexafluoropropylene Nanotrap for Highly Efficient Purification of Octafluoropropane Electronic Specialty Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;purity octafluoropropane (C3F8) electronic specialty gas is a key chemical raw material in semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing industry, while selective removal of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) impurity for C3F8 purification is essential but a challenging task. Here we report a fluorinated cage&#8208;like MOF Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 (bzc = 5&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) for C3F6/C3F8 separation. The incorporation of &#8208;CF3 groups not only provides suitable pore aperture size for highly efficient size&#8208;exclusive C3F6/C3F8 separation, but also creates hydrophobic microenvironments, endowing Zn&#8208;bz&#8208;CF3 high chemical stability. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 exhibits high C3F6 adsorption capacity while excluding C3F8, achieving ideal molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation. Breakthrough experiments show that Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 can efficiently separate C3F6/C3F8 mixture and high&#8208;purity C3F8 (99.9%) can be obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose the development of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;O coupling method utilizing a new&#160;N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand,&#160;L8.&#160;&#160;Under optimized reaction conditions, structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl bromides underwent efficient coupling with a variety of alcohols at room temperature using an&#160;L8&#8208;based catalyst. Notably, the&#160;L8&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited enhanced activity when compared to the&#160;L4&#8208;based system previously disclosed for C&#8211;N coupling, namely the ability to functionalize aryl bromides containing acidic functional groups. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that C&#8211;O coupling utilizing&#160;L8&#8226;Cu involves rate&#8208;limiting alkoxide transmetallation, resulting in a mechanism of C&#8211;O bond formation that is distinct from previously described Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, or Ni&#8208;based systems. This lower energy pathway leads to rapid C&#8211;O bond formation; a 7&#8208;fold increase relative to what is seen with other ligands. The results presented in this report overcome limitations in previously described C&#8211;O coupling methods and introduce a new ligand that we anticipate may be useful in other Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.</dc:description>

Several generations towards the target molecules are presented including the spectacular failure of a key C&#8211;H oxidation on a late&#8208;stage intermediate. The final route features rapid, stereocontrolled access to a densely functionalized pyrrolidine and an unprecedented diastereoselective oxidative electrochemical cyclization to forge the hallmark 9&#8208;membered ring.

         <title>Directing in Vitro Selection towards G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming Aptamers to Inhibit HMGB1 Pathological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for novel, effective inhibitors of High&#8208;Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1) &#8211; a protein involved in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer &#8211; we herein discovered a set of anti&#8208;HMGB1 G&#8208;quadruplex(G4)&#8208;forming aptamers by using an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotides. The selected DNA sequences were then studied in a pseudo&#8208;physiological buffer mimicking the extracellular medium, where HMGB1 exerts its pathological activity, using spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and chromatographic techniques. All the oligonucleotides proved to fold into monomeric G4s and in some cases also dimeric species, stable at physiological temperature. Remarkably, the protein preferentially recognized the sequences forming dimeric parallel G4 structures, as evidenced by a properly designed chemiluminescent binding assay which also highlighted a good selectivity of these aptamers for HMGB1. Moreover, all aptamers showed anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity, inhibiting protein&#8208;induced cell migration. The acquired data allowed identifying L12 as the best anti&#8208;HMGB1 aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, no toxicity at least up to 5 &#181;M concentration on healthy cells, along with potent anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity (IC50 ca. 28 nM) and good binding affinity for the protein, thus indicating it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Transformation of Alcohols via Phosphoranyl Radical from Exogenous Radical Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general approach to the direct deoxygenative transformation of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols has been developed. It undergoes through phosphoranyl radical intermediates generated by the addition of exogenous iodine radical to trivalent alkoxylphosphanes. Since these alkoxylphosphanes are readily in&#8208;situ obtained from alcohols and commercially available, inexpensive chlorodiphenylphosphine, a diverse range of alcohols with various functional groups can be utilized to proceed deoxygenative cross&#8208;couplings with alkenes or aryl iodides. The selective transformation of polyhydroxy substrates and the rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules are also demonstrated with this method.</dc:description>

However, it is still facing problems such as low yield as well as low stability. Here, a new carbon&#8208;coated liquid alloy catalyst, Ga79Cu11Mo10@C is designed for efficient electrochemical urea synthesis by activating Ga active sites. During the N2 and CO2 co&#8208;reduction process, the yield of urea reaches 28.25 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, which is the highest yield reported so far under the same conditions, the Faraday efficiency (FE) is also as high as 60.6% at &#8208;0.4 V vs. RHE. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent stability under 100 h of testing. Comprehensive analyses showed that sequential exposure of a high density of active sites promoted the adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 for efficient coupling reactions. This coupling reaction occurs through a thermodynamic spontaneous reaction between *N=N* and CO to form a C&#8208;N bond. The deformability of&#160;liquid state&#160;enhances&#160;resistance to poisoning. Moreover, the introduction of Cu and Mo stimulates the Ga active sites, which successfully synthesises the *NCON* intermediate. The reaction energy barrier of the third proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process rate&#8208;determining&#160;step (RDS) *NHCONH&#8594; *NHCONH2 was lowered, ensuring the efficient synthesis of urea.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating 3D Nanoparticle Structural Space via Data Augmentation to Bidirectionally Predict Nanoparticle Mixture&#8217;s Purity, Size, and Shape from Extinction Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticle (NP) characterization is essential because diverse shapes, sizes, and morphologies inevitably occur in as&#8208;synthesized NP mixtures, profoundly impacting their properties and applications. Currently, the only technique to concurrently determine these structural parameters is electron microscopy, but it is time&#8208;intensive and tedious. Here, we create a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) NP structural space to concurrently determine the purity, size, and shape of 1000 sets of as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanocubes mixtures containing interfering nanospheres and nanowires from their extinction spectra, attaining low predictive errors at 2.7 &#8211; 7.9%. We first use plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment to extract localized surface plasmon resonance attributes from spectra and establish a lasso regressor (LR) model to predict purity, size, and shape. Leveraging the learned LR, we artificially generate 425,592 augmented extinction spectra to overcome data scarcity and create a comprehensive NP structural space to bidirectionally predict extinction spectra from structural parameters with &lt;4% error. Our interpretable NP structural space further elucidates the two higher&#8208;order combined electric dipole, quadrupole, and magnetic dipole as the critical structural parameter predictors. By incorporating other NP shapes and mixtures' extinction spectra, we anticipate our approach, especially the data augmentation, can create a fully generalizable NP structural space to drive on&#8208;demand, autonomous synthesis&#8208;characterization platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24 &#8211; A Chromium(+IV) Nitridosilicate Phosphate with Amphibole&#8208;Type Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first nitridic analog of an amphibole mineral, the quaternary nitridosilicate phosphate Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24 was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400 &#176;C and 12&#160;GPa from the binary nitrides Cr2N, Si3N4 and P3N5, using NH4N3 and NH4F as additional nitrogen source and mineralizing agent, respectively. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8209;ray diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation (C2/m, a = 9.6002(19), b = 17.107(3), c = 4.8530(10) &#197;, &#946; = 109.65(3)&#176;). The elemental composition was analyzed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The structure consists of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming zweier double chains and edge&#8208;sharing (Si,Cr)&#8208;centered octahedra forming separated ribbons. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy shows ordered Si and Cr sites next to a disordered Si/Cr site. Optical spectroscopy indicates a band gap of 2.1 eV. Susceptibility measurements show paramagnetic behavior and support the oxidation state Cr+IV, which is confirmed by EPR. The comprehensive analysis expands the field of Cr&#8208;N chemistry and provides access to a nitride analog of one of the most prevalent silicate structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling pH&#8208;Dependent Adsorption Strength of *CO2&#8722; Intermediate over High&#8208;Density Sn Single Atom Catalyst for Acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for direct formic acid (HCOOH) production holds promise in meeting the carbon&#8208;neutral target, yet its performance is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Understanding the adsorption strength of the key intermediates in acidic electrolyte is indispensable to favor CO2RR over HER. In this work, high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalysts (SACs) were prepared and used as catalyst, to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength and coverage of *CO2&#8722; intermediates that enables enhanced acidic CO2RR towards direct HCOOH production. At pH = 3, Sn SACs could deliver a high Faradaic efficiency (90.8%) of HCOOH formation and a corresponding partial current density up to &#8211;178.5 mA cm&#8722;2. The detailed in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopic studies reveal that a favorable alkaline microenvironment for CO2RR to HCOOH is formed near the surface of Sn SACs, even in the acidic electrolyte. More importantly, the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722; intermediates is unravelled over the Sn SACs, which in turn affects the competition between HER and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Multi&#8208;Cage Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for an Effective One&#8208;step Separation of Branched Alkanes Feeds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The improvement of the Total Isomerization Process (TIP) for the production of high&#8208;quality gasoline with the ultimate goal of reaching a Research Octane Number (RON) higher than 92 requires the use of specific sorbents to separate pentane and hexane isomers into classes of linear, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;branched isomers. Herein we report the design of a new multi&#8208;cage microporous Fe(III)&#8208;MOF (referred to as MIP&#8208;214, MIP stands for materials of the Institute of Porous Materials of Paris) with a flu&#8208;e topology, incorporating an asymmetric heterofunctional ditopic ligand, 4&#8208;pyrazolecarboxylic acid, that exhibits an appropriate microporous structure for a thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of hydrocarbon isomers. This MOF produced via a direct, scalable, and mild synthesis route was proven to encompass a unique separation of C5/C6 isomers by classes of low RON over high RON alkanes with a sorption hierarchy: (n&#8208;hexane &gt;&gt; n&#8208;pentane &#8776; 2&#8208;methylpentane &gt; 3&#8208;methylpentane)low RON&gt;&gt;(2,3&#8208;dimethylbutane &#8776; i&#8208;pentane &#8776; 2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane)high RON following the adsorption enthalpy sequence. We reveal for the first time that a single sorbent can efficiently separate such a complex mixture of high RON di&#8208;branched hexane and mono&#8208;branched pentane isomers from their low RON counterparts, which is a major achievement reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites Promote OH* Formation and Enhance Formate Selectivity: Towards High&#8208;efficiency Glycerol Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a sustainable valorization route, electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) involves in formation of key OH* and selective adsorption/cleavage of C&#8208;C(O) intermediates with multi&#8208;step electron transfer, thus suffering from high potential and poor formate selectivity for most non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. So, it remains challenging to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship as well as construct synergistic sites to realize high&#8208;activity and high&#8208;selectivity GOR. Herein, we successfully achieve dual&#8208;high performance with low potentials and superior formate selectivity for GOR by forming synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in Ni&#8208;alloyed Co&#8208;based spinel. The optimized NiCo oxide solid&#8208;acid electrocatalyst exhibits low reaction potential (1.219 V@10 mA/cm2) and high formate selectivity (94.0%) toward GOR. In&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pH&#8208;dependence measurements show that the Lewis acid centers could accelerate OH* production, while the Br&#248;nsted acid centers are proved to facilitate high&#8208;selectivity formation of formate. Theoretical calculations reveal that NiCo alloyed oxide shows appropriate d&#8208;band center, thus balancing adsorption/desorption of C&#8208;O intermediates. This study provides new insights into rationally designing solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts for biomass electro&#8208;upcycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Spaced double hydrogen bonding for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen reductive H2O2 production is a promising approach to alternative industrial anthraquinone processes while suffering from the requirement of pure O2 feedstock for practical application. Herein, we report a spaced double hydrogen bond (IC&#8208;H&#8208;bond) through multi&#8208;component Radziszewski reaction in an imidazole poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite (SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2) and levofloxacin hydrochloride (LEV) electron donor for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production. It is found that the IC&#8208;H&#8208;bond formed by spaced imino (&#8208;NH&#8208;) group of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 and carbonyl (&#8208;C=O) group of LEV can switch the imidazole active sites characteristic from a covered state to a fully exposed one to shield the strong adsorption of electron donor and N2 in the air, and propel an intenser positive potential and more efficient orbitals binding patterns of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 surface to establish competitive active sites for selectivity O2 chemisorption. Moreover, the high electron enrichment of imidazole as an active site for the 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction ensures the rapid reduction of O2. Therefore, the IC&#8208;H&#8208;bond enables a total O2 utilization and conversion efficiency of 94.8% from direct photocatalytic air reduction, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 1518 &#181;mol/g/h that is 16 and 23 times compared to poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite without spaced imino groups (PIL&#8208;TiO2) and TiO2, respectively.</dc:description>

It is found that the IC-H-bond formed by spaced imino (-NH-) group of SI-PIL-TiO2 and carbonyl (-C=O) group of LEV can switch the imidazole active sites characteristic from a covered state to a fully exposed one to shield the strong adsorption of electron donor and N2 in the air, and propel an intenser positive potential and more efficient orbitals binding patterns of SI-PIL-TiO2 surface to establish competitive active sites for selectivity O2 chemisorption. Moreover, the high electron enrichment of imidazole as an active site for the 2e- oxygen reduction ensures the rapid reduction of O2.

         <title>Making Plasticized Polymer Electrolytes Stable Against Sodium Metal for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes based on plastic crystals are promising for solid&#8208;state sodium metal (Na0) batteries, yet their practicality has been hindered by the notorious Na0&#8208;electrolyte interface instability issue, the underlying cause of which remains poorly understood. Here, by leveraging a model plasticized polymer electrolyte based on conventional succinonitrile plastic crystals, we uncover its failure origin in Na0 batteries is associated with the formation of a thick and non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and whiskery Na0 nucleation/growth. Furthermore, we design a new additive&#8208;embedded plasticized polymer electrolyte to manipulate the Na0 deposition and SEI formulation. For the first time, we demonstrate that introducing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive into the succinonitrile&#8208;plasticized polymer electrolyte can effectively protect Na0 against interfacial corrosion by facilitating the growth of dome&#8208;like Na0 with thin, amorphous, and fluorine&#8208;rich SEIs, thus enabling significantly improved performances of Na//Na symmetric cells (1,800h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2) and Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells (93.0% capacity retention after 1,200 cycles at 1 C rate in coin cells and 93.1% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3 in pouch cells at room temperature). Our work provides valuable insights into the interfacial failure of plasticized polymer electrolytes and offers a promising solution to resolving the interfacial instability issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Torsional Strain Enabled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Axially Chiral Semiaromatic Polyesters with Chemically Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new chemically recyclable polymers via monomer design would provide a transformative strategy to address the energy crisis and plastic pollution problem. Biaryl&#8208;fused cyclic esters were targeted to generate axially chiral polymers, which would impart new material performance. To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain. Impressively, Me&#8208;DBO readily went through well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, producing polymer P(Me&#8208;DBO) with high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt;100 &#176;C). Intriguingly, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material, affording a semicrystalline stereocomplex with a melting transition temperature more than 300 &#176;C.&#160; P(Me&#8208;DBO) were capable of depolymerizing back to Me&#8208;DBO in high efficiency, highlighting an excellent recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of an Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate into a Thin Film for Choline Recognition in an Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional thin films, being fabricated by incorporating discrete supramolecular architectures, have potential applications in the research area such as sensing, energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Here, we have manifested that anion&#8208;coordination triple helicate can be solution&#8208;processed into a functional thin film through incorporation into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The thin films fabricated by incorporation of 3&#8835;GS/R (Film3&#8835;GS/R, 3 = anion&#8208;coordination triple helicate) show multiple optical properties of fluorescence, CD, and CPL. In addition, Film3&#8835;NEt3H+ shows the ability to recognize choline and choline derivatives in water system. The successful recognition of Ch+ by Film3&#8835;NEt3H+ represents the first example of utilizing 'aniono'&#8208;supramolecular architectures for biomolecule&#160;detection in aqueous solution and opens up a new route for designing biocompatible functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Simplifying Access to Targeted Protein Degraders via Nickel Electrocatalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;C linked glutarimide&#8208;containing structures with direct utility in the preparation of cereblon&#8208;based degraders (PROTACs, CELMoDs) can be assessed in a single step from inexpensive, commercial&#160;a&#8208;bromoglutarimide through a unique Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid assisted Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic approach. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups that are historically problematic and can be applied to the simplified synthesis of dozens of known compounds that have only been procured through laborious, wasteful, multi&#8208;step sequences. The reaction is scalable in both batch and flow and features a trivial procedure wherein the most time&#8208;consuming aspect of reaction setup is weighing out the starting materials.
