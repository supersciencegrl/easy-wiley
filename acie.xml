         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Cage Framework with High Selectivity and Reversibility in Fullerene Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest chemistry, a pivotal branch of supramolecular chemistry, plays an essential role in understanding and constructing complex structures through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Organic molecular cages, characterized by their intrinsic confined cavities, can selectively bind a variety of guest molecules. Their host&#8208;guest chemistry has been well studied in the solution phase, and several attempts have been made to encode well&#8208;defined molecular architectures into solid&#8208;state polymeric materials. However, only limited studies have explored their potential in the solid state, where their lack of robustness and less ordered networks significantly hinder practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a single&#8208;crystal cage framework and a systematic study of its host&#8208;guest chemistry, spanning from the solution state to the solid state. Our studies reveal that the host&#8208;guest interactions inherent to the cage are successfully maintained in the solid&#8208;state polymeric material. Furthermore, the framework's robustness allows for the guest molecules (fullerene) to be released triggered by an organic acid (trifluoracetic acid), with subsequent regeneration of the framework through an organic base (triethylamine) treatment. Our findings represent the first synthesis of a robust, single&#8208;crystal cage framework exhibiting highly selective and reversible host&#8208;guest chemistry, thus showing great potential towards molecular separation application.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of acetic acid, an important industrial chemical traditionally obtained through the carbonylation of methanol using noble metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts, encounters challenges arising from high equipment costs and sustainability concerns. The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane emerges as a promising alternative, capitalizing on abundant natural gas resources and featuring a potentially mild and straightforward process. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to the scarcity of active sites and the swift generation of C1 oxygenates, posing difficulties for subsequent carbonylation and impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZ5&#8208;TF catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 50 &#176;C, surpassing the previous maximum (12.0 mmol gcat&#8208;1h&#8208;1) by more than threefold. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process. This synergistic action promotes C&#8208;C coupling, resulting in the efficient synthesis of acetic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid at 0&#8208;25oC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high&#8208;temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0&#8208;25&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g&#8208;C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single&#8208;atom sites. In&#8208;situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single&#8208;atom of OH&#8208;Pd1&#197;/g&#8208;C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C&#8208;H instead of C&#8208;C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14 eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis. This integration of photocatalysis in low&#8208;temperature oxidation demonstrates a new route of selective oxidation of light alkanes.</dc:description>

Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high-temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0-25&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g-C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single-atom sites. In-situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single-atom of OH-Pd1&#197;/g-C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C-H instead of C-C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14 eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy-efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is&#160;1.70 g cm&#8208;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5 g cm&#8208;3) and chloride (around 2.5 g cm&#8208;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li | LPSO | Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50 mV under 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 for over 4200 h at 25 &#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29% after 200 cycles under 88.6 mA g&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conductive Binder Based on Mesoscopic Interpenetration with Polysulfides Capturing Skeleton and Redox Intermediates Network for Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high theoretical energy density and readily available cathode active materials is hampered by problems such as sulfur insulation, dramatic volume changes, and polysulfide shuttling. The targeted development of novel binders is the most industrialized solution to the problem of sulfur cathodes. Herein, an aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell, which is capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating polymer network, is synthesized and investigated. Not only can the elastic skeleton formed by the copolymer bind the active substance under drastic volume changes, but also the rich ester and cyanide groups in it can effectively capture lithium polysulfide. Meanwhile, the conducting skeleton consisting of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) both provides the additional charge conduction pathways and acts as the redox intermediates, significantly accelerating the kinetic process of lithium polysulfide conversion. Based on the synergistic effect of the above mechanisms, the use of the prepared binder on the sulfur carbon cathode significantly improves the rate performance and cycle stability of lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Interfacial Morphological and Chemical Evolution in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing lithium (Li) ions and understanding Li plating/stripping processes as well as evolution of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) are critical for optimizing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMB). However, the buried solid&#8208;solid interfaces present a challenge for detection which preclude the employment of multiple analysis techniques. Herein, by employing complementary in situ characterizations, morphological/chemical evolution, Li plating/stripping dynamics and SEI dynamics were efficiently decoupled and Li ion behavior at interface between different solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE) was successfully detected. The innovative combining experiments of in situ atomic force microscopy and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on Li metal anode revealed interfacial morphological/chemical evolution and decoupled Li plating/stripping process from SEI evolution. Though Li plating speed in Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) was higher than Li3PS4 (LPS), speed of SSE decomposition was similar and ~85% interfacial SSE turned into SEI during plating and remained unchanged in stripping. To leverage strengths of different SSEs, an LPS&#8208;LGPS&#8208;LPS sandwich electrolyte was developed, demonstrating enhanced ionic conductivity and improved interfacial stability with less SSE decomposition (25%). Using in situ Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, Li&#8208;ion behavior at interface between different SSEs was effectively visualized, uncovering distribution of Li ions at LGPS|LPS interface under different potentials.</dc:description>

The innovative combining experiments of in situ atomic force microscopy and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on Li metal anode revealed interfacial morphological/chemical evolution and decoupled Li plating/stripping process from SEI evolution. Though Li plating speed in Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) was higher than Li3PS4 (LPS), speed of SSE decomposition was similar and ~85% interfacial SSE turned into SEI during plating and remained unchanged in stripping. To leverage strengths of different SSEs, an LPS-LGPS-LPS sandwich electrolyte was developed, demonstrating enhanced ionic conductivity and improved interfacial stability with less SSE decomposition (25%). Using in situ Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, Li-ion behavior at interface between different SSEs was effectively visualized, uncovering distribution of Li ions at LGPS|LPS interface under different potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Are Redox&#8208;Active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry textbooks teach that the behavior of charged redox centers bound by saturated linkers is essentially governed by electrostatics. We show that for short alkanes and pyridiniums, as Coulombic and through&#8208;bond interactions become ineffective, reductive cyclomer formation is governed by London dispersion and &#963;&#8208;type overlap of 2pz atomic orbitals of the C&#947; atoms of electrophoric ends rather than by electron spin&#8208;spin interaction.







Abstract
The extent to which electrophores covalently bridged by a saturated linker are electrochemically independent was investigated considering the charge/spin duality of the electron and functionality of the electrophore as a spin carrier upon reduction. By combining computational modeling with electrochemical experiments, we investigated the mechanism by which tethered electrophores react together within 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oligo[n]methylene&#8208;bipyridinium assemblies (with n=2 to 5). We show that native dicationic electrophores (redox state Z=+2) are folded prior to electron injection into the system, allowing the emergence of supra&#8208;molecular orbitals (supra&#8208;MOs) likely to support the process of the reductive &#963; bond formation giving cyclomers. Indeed, for Z=+2, London Dispersion (LD) forces contribute to flatten the potential energy surface such that all&#8208;trans and folded conformers are approximately isoenergetic. Then, upon one&#8208;electron injection, for radical cations (Z=+1), LD forces significantly stabilize the folded conformers, except for the ethylene derivative deprived of supra&#8208;MOs. For radical cations equipped with supra&#8208;MOs, the unpaired electron is delocalized over both heterocycles through space. Cyclomer completion (Z=0) upon the second electron transfer occurs according to the inversion of redox potentials. This mechanism explains why intramolecular reactivity is favored and why pyridinium electrophores are not independent.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Macrocycle for Efficient Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins, DNA, and CRISPR Cas9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[+]	S.&#8197;Q. and I.&#8197;A.&#8197;B. contributed equally to this work.A cell penetrating macrocycle (CPM) with flexible amine linkages and amphiphilic nature assembles into a micellar&#8208;like structure that can passively permeate through the cell membrane. CPM can efficiently transfer fully functioning proteins and genetic materials into the cytosol, independent of size, charge, or complexity.







Abstract
The discovery of safe platforms that can circumvent the endocytic pathway is of great significance for biological therapeutics that are usually degraded during endocytosis. Here we show that a self&#8208;assembled and dynamic macrocycle can passively diffuse through the cell membrane and deliver a broad range of biologics, including proteins, CRISPR Cas9, and ssDNA, directly to the cytosol while retaining their bioactivity. Cell&#8208;penetrating macrocycle CPM can be easily prepared from the room temperature condensation of diketopyrrolopyrrole lactams with diamines. We attribute the high cellular permeability of CPM to its amphiphilic nature and chameleonic properties. It adopts conformations that partially bury polar groups and expose hydrophobic side chains, thus self&#8208;assembling into micellar&#8208;like structures. Its superior fluorescence makes CPM trackable inside cells where it follows the endomembrane system. CPM outperformed commercial reagents for biologics delivery and showed high RNA knockdown efficiency of CRISPR Cas9. We envisage that this macrocycle will be an ideal starting point to design and synthesize biomimetic macrocyclic tags that can readily facilitate the interaction and uptake of biomolecules and overcome endosomal digestion.

         <title>Transient Covalent Polymers through Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent polymers generated by chemical fuel reactions should serve as useful model systems for nonequilibrium assembly. Here, aqueous poly(anhydrides) have been generated by treatment of dicarboxylic acid monomers with carbodiimides. Molecular weights over 15,000 have been achieved, with polymer lifetimes on the order of hours to weeks. The effect of solvent, reactant concentrations, and temperature has been examined.







Abstract
Biochemical systems make use of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium polymers generated under kinetic control. Inspired by these systems, many abiotic supramolecular polymers driven by chemical fuel reactions have been reported. Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated. The results reveal substantial control over polymer assembly and disassembly kinetics, highlighting the potential for fine&#8208;tuned kinetic control in nonequilibrium polymerization systems.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>

         <dc:description>
A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Z&#8208;Selective &#948;&#8208;Hydroarylation of Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition</title>

         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported, giving Z&#8208;alkene products in &gt;95&#8201;% ee and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E. Protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is likely the slow step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer with MeOH.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate arylations of electron&#8208;poor alkenes are highly selective processes for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. &#948;&#8208;Selective hydroarylations of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes are less well developed and reactions that deliver high enantioselectivity while giving single alkene isomer products are elusive. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes that gives nearly exclusive Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products (generally with &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 positional and geometrical selectivity). This remote functionalization provides access to chiral diarylated alkenes from readily available precursors poised for further functionalization, including in the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is the turnover limiting step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer pathway.

         <title>Solar Azo&#8208;Switches for Effective E&#8594;Z Photoisomerization by Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sunlight&#8208;induced isomerization of azo&#8208;switches is realized through spectral reshaping. Our sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches absorb across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum and achieve 80&#8211;90&#8201;% E&#8594;Z isomerization yields under unfiltered sunlight. Solar switches hold great potential for sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy utilization for applications such as molecular machines, actuators, and molecular solar thermal storage.







Abstract
Natural photoactive systems have evolved to harness broad&#8208;spectrum light from solar radiation for critical functions such as light perception and photosynthetic energy conversion. Molecular photoswitches, which undergo structural changes upon light absorption, are artificial photoactive tools widely used for developing photoresponsive systems and converting light energy. However, photoswitches generally need to be activated by light of specific narrow wavelength ranges for effective photoconversion, which limits their ability to directly work under sunlight and to efficiently harvest solar energy. Here, focusing on azo&#8208;switches&#8212;the most extensively studied photoswitches, we demonstrate effective solar E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with photoconversions exceeding 80&#8201;% under unfiltered sunlight. These sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches are developed by rendering the absorption of E isomers overwhelmingly stronger than that of Z isomers across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum. This unusual type of spectral profile is realized by a simple yet highly adjustable molecular design strategy, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of spectral window that extends light absorption beyond 600&#8197;nm. Notably, back&#8208;photoconversion can be achieved without impairing the forward solar isomerization, resulting in unique light&#8208;reversible solar switches. Such exceptional solar chemistry of photoswitches provides unprecedented opportunities for developing sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy technologies.

         <title>Engineering Low Volume Resuscitants for the Prehospital Care of Severe Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traumatic injury is a leading cause of global suffering and death. We rationally design polymeric, low volume resuscitants (LVRs) for the prehospital treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock. By varying polymer architecture, Rg, and composition to influence resuscitation, coagulation, and biodistribution, we developed a radiant star polymer that is non&#8208;coagulopathic and corrects 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable LVR has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.







Abstract
Globally, traumatic injury is a leading cause of suffering and death. The ability to curtail damage and ensure survival after major injury requires a time&#8208;sensitive response balancing organ perfusion, blood loss, and portability, underscoring the need for novel therapies for the prehospital environment. Currently, there are few options available for damage control resuscitation (DCR) of trauma victims. We hypothesize that synthetic polymers, which are tunable, portable, and stable under austere conditions, can be developed as effective injectable therapies for trauma medicine. In this work, we design injectable polymers for use as low volume resuscitants (LVRs). Using RAFT polymerization, we evaluate the effect of polymer size, architecture, and chemical composition upon both blood coagulation and resuscitation in a rat hemorrhagic shock model. Our therapy is evaluated against a clinically used colloid resuscitant, Hextend. We demonstrate that a radiant star poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) polymer did not interfere with coagulation while successfully correcting metabolic deficit and resuscitating animals from hemorrhagic shock to the desired mean arterial pressure range for DCR &#8211; correcting a 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable and non&#8208;coagulopathic resuscitant has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.

         <title>Photoinitiated Transient Self&#8208;Assembly in a Catalytically Driven Chemical Reaction Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show a catalytically&#8208;driven chemical reaction network (CRN) photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light. By combining photoredox and organometallic catalysis relying on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release deactivating fuel, we can control the formation of transient supramolecular fibers. Irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of deactivating fuel, leading to faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light activation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.







Abstract
Chemically fueled chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential in controlling dissipative self&#8208;assembly. A key challenge in the field is to store chemical fuel&#8208;precursors or &#8220;pre&#8208;fuels&#8221; in the system that are converted into activating or deactivating fuels in a catalytically controlled CRN. In addition, real&#8208;time control over catalysis in a CRN by light is highly desirable, but so far not yet achieved. Here we show a catalytically driven CRN that is photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light, producing activated monomers that go on to perform transient self&#8208;assembly. Monomer activation proceeds via photoredox catalysis, converting the monomer alcohol groups into the corresponding aldehydes that self&#8208;assemble into large supramolecular fibers. Monomer deactivation is achieved by organometallic catalysis that relies on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release formate (i.e. the deactivating fuel). Additionally, irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of formate by photo&#8208;uncaging the pre&#8208;fuel, leading to a factor of ca. 2 faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light photoactivation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.

         <title>Surfactant Directionally Assembled at the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Facilitating Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant&#8208;modified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces have been designed for cathodic catalytic conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Under the application potential conditions, the surfactant undergoes a conformational transition from random distribution to directional assembly. This microenvironmental regulation strategy achieves efficient hydrogenation of HMF and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a promising alternative to conventional thermal processes. Both the catalyst and electrolyte deeply impact the performance. Designing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface remains challenging due to its compositional and structural complexity. Here, we employ the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a reaction model. The typical cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and its analogs are employed as electrolyte additives to tune the interfacial microenvironment, delivering high&#8208;efficiency hydrogenation of HMF and inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The surfactants experience a conformational transformation from stochastic distribution to directional assembly under applied potential. This oriented arrangement hampers the transfer of water molecules to the interface and promotes the enrichment of reactants. In addition, near 100&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) selectivity is achieved, and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the BHMF is improved from 61&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the microenvironmental modulation strategy applies to a range of electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions involving aldehyde substrates. This work paves the way for engineering advanced electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and boosting unsaturated alcohol electrosynthesis efficiency.

This oriented arrangement hampers the transfer of water molecules to the interface and promotes the enrichment of reactants. In addition, near 100&#8201;% 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) selectivity is achieved, and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the BHMF is improved from 61&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the microenvironmental modulation strategy applies to a range of electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions involving aldehyde substrates. This work paves the way for engineering advanced electrode-electrolyte interfaces and boosting unsaturated alcohol electrosynthesis efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Induced Interstitial Effects Drive Water Oxidation on Ordered Ir&#8722;B Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The B&#8208;induced interstitial effects in intermetallic IrB1.1 balance the acidic water oxidation activity and stability and leads to a good operation in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high&#8208;temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir&#8722;B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir&#8722;B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B&#8208;induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

         <title>Spirobifluorene Trimers: High Triplet Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of extended pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials with a high triplet energy, a wide HOMO/LUMO gap and improved thermal properties compared to reported PHCs have been constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. When used as the host in blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24&#8201;% with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off was reached.







Abstract
Pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHCs) represent a new generation of host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), free of heteroatoms. They reduce the molecular complexity, can be easily synthesized and are an important direction towards robust devices. As heteroatoms can be involved in bonds dissociations in operating OLEDs through exciton induced degradation processes, developing novel PHCs appear particularly relevant for the future of this technology. In the present work, we report a series of extended PHCs constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. The resulting positional isomers present a high triplet energy level, a wide HOMO/LUMO difference and improved thermal and morphological properties compared to previously reported PHCs. These characteristics are beneficial for the next generation of host materials for PhOLEDs and provide relevant design guidelines. When used as a host in blue&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs, which are still the weakest link of the field, a very high EQE of 24&#8201;% and low threshold voltage of 3.56&#8197;V were obtained with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off. This high performance strengthens the position of PHC strategy as an efficient alternative for OLED technology and opens the way to a more simple electronic.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled redox gold catalysis. Unlike the classical Cope rearrangement involving 1,5&#8208;hexadienes, a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes using the merger of &#960;&#8208;activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactivity, has been achieved.







Abstract
Cope rearrangements have garnered significant attention owing to their ability to undergo structural reorganization in stereoselective manner. While substantial advances have been achieved over decades, these rearrangements remained applicable exclusively to parent 1,5&#8208;hexadienes. Herein, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes via a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement employing ligand&#8208;enabled gold redox catalysis. Detailed mechanistic investigations including several control experiments, cross&#8208;over experiment, HRMS analysis, 31P&#8197;NMR and DFT studies have been performed to underpin the mechanism.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization Induced by Ferromagnetic Sulfur doped C3N4 Triggers Selective H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) catalyst causes the in&#8208;plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H2O2.







Abstract
For the 2D metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of pz orbitals to overlap laterally, thus forming &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) materials as a model, we propose a strategy to promote localized electron polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra&#8208;thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets. The introduction of sulfur (S) further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling, thereby inducing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consequently, S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and achieves a superb H2O2 production rate, approaching 4374.8&#8197;ppm during continuous electrolysis over 300&#8197;hour. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the ortho&#8208;S configuration can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.

         <title>A Cyclometalated Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces Oncosis for Synergistic Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus and mitochondria dual&#8208;localized ruthenium(II) complex disrupts DNA to activate PARP1 protein combined with ATP consumption and produces mitochondrial oxidative stress, triggering porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 protein to induce cell oncosis and boosting innate and adaptive immunity.







Abstract
An optimal cancer chemotherapy regimen should effectively address the drug resistance of tumors while eliciting antitumor&#8208;immune responses. Research has shown that non&#8208;apoptotic cell death, such as pyroptosis and ferroptosis, can enhance the immune response. Despite this, there has been limited investigation and reporting on the mechanisms of oncosis and its correlation with immune response. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ru(II) complex that targeted the nucleus and mitochondria to induce cell oncosis. Briefly, the Ru(II) complex disrupts the nucleus and mitochondria DNA, which active polyADP&#8208;ribose polymerase&#8197;1, accompanied by ATP consumption and porimin activation. Concurrently, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress result in the release of Ca2+ ions and increased expression of Calpain&#8197;1. Subsequently, specific pore proteins porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 promote cristae destruction or vacuolation, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture. The analysis of RNA sequencing demonstrates that the Ru(II) complex can initiate the oncosis&#8208;associated pathway and activate both innate and adaptive immunity. In vivo experiments have confirmed that oncosis promotes dendritic cell maturation and awakens adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also activates the innate immune by inducing the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 phenotype.

Research has shown that non-apoptotic cell death, such as pyroptosis and ferroptosis, can enhance the immune response. Despite this, there has been limited investigation and reporting on the mechanisms of oncosis and its correlation with immune response. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ru(II) complex that targeted the nucleus and mitochondria to induce cell oncosis. Briefly, the Ru(II) complex disrupts the nucleus and mitochondria DNA, which active polyADP-ribose polymerase&#8197;1, accompanied by ATP consumption and porimin activation. Concurrently, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress result in the release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and increased expression of Calpain&#8197;1. Subsequently, specific pore proteins porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 promote cristae destruction or vacuolation, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture. The analysis of RNA sequencing demonstrates that the Ru(II) complex can initiate the oncosis-associated pathway and activate both innate and adaptive immunity. In vivo experiments have confirmed that oncosis promotes dendritic cell maturation and awakens adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also activates the innate immune by inducing the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rationally Designed Iron(II) Catalyst for C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined iron catalyst with high efficiency for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling involving C(sp3) partners is described. In the presence of a lithium amide base, this catalyst enabled, for the first time, C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; alkyl halides and (hetero)aryl boronic esters as well as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl halides and 1&#176; and 2&#176; alkyl boranes under mild conditions and with broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Despite the paramount importance of the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) in academia and industry, and the great promise of iron to offer sustainable catalysis, iron&#8208;catalyzed SMC involving sp3&#8208;hybridized partners is still in its infancy. We herein report the development of a versatile, well&#8208;defined electron&#8208;deficient anilido&#8208;aldimine iron(II) catalyst. This catalyst effectively performed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) SMC of alkyl halide electrophiles and (hetero)aryl boronic ester and alkyl borane nucleophiles respectively, in the presence of a lithium amide base. These couplings operated under mild reaction conditions and displayed wide functional group compatibility including various medicinally relevant N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;based heterocycles. They also tolerated primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), electron&#8208;neutral, &#8208;rich and &#8208;poor boronic esters and primary and secondary alkyl boranes. Our methodology could be directly and efficiently applied to synthesize key intermediates relevant to pharmaceuticals and a potential drug candidate. For C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) couplings, radical probe experiments militated in favor of a carbon&#8208;centered radical derived from the electrophile. At the same time, reactions run with a pre&#8208;formed activated boron nucleophile coupled to competition experiments supported the involvement of neutral, rather than an anionic, (hetero)aryl boronic ester in the key transmetalation step.

         <title>Facile Access to Organostibines via Selective Organic Superbase Catalyzed Antimony&#8208;Carbon Protonolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C6F5, the perfect leaving group for highly selective antimony&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions via organosuperbase&#8208;catalysis! This novel approach enables mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted perfluorophenyl stibines to be smoothly converted to a range of synthetically useful aromatic, heteroaromatic and alkynyl&#8208;substituted stibines under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
The selective formation of antimony&#8208;carbon bonds via organic superbase catalysis under metal&#8208; and salt&#8208;free conditions is reported. This novel approach utilizes electron&#8208;deficient stibine, Sb(C6F5)3, to give upon base&#8208;catalyzed reactions with weakly acidic aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons access to a range of new aromatic and heteroaromatic stibines, respectively, with loss of C6HF5. Also, the significantly less electron&#8208;deficient stibines, Ph2SbC6F5 and PhSb(C6F5)2 smoothly underwent base&#8208;catalyzed exchange reactions with a range of terminal alkynes to generate the stibines of formulae PhSb(C&#8801;CPh)2, and Ph2SbC&#8801;CR [R=C6H5, C6H4&#8208;NO2, COOEt, CH2Cl, CH2NEt2, CH2OSiMe3, Sb(C6H5)2], respectively. These formal substitution reactions proceed with high selectivity as only the C6F5 groups serve as a leaving group to be liberated as C6HF5 upon formal proton transfer from the alkyne. Kinetic studies of the base&#8208;catalyzed reaction of Ph2SbC6F5 with phenyl acetylene to form Ph2SbC&#8801;CPh and C6HF5 suggested the empirical rate law to exhibit a first&#8208;order dependence with respect to the base catalyst, alkyne and stibine. DFT calculations support a pathway proceeding via a concerted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis transition state, where the base catalyst activates the Sb&#8208;C6F5 bond sequence through secondary bond interactions.

         <title>Catalytic (4+2) Annulation via Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Interception of in&#8208;situ Generated Alkylgold Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished under gold&#8208;complex and chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide synergetic catalysis, providing chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans with high efficiency and selectivity. This method complements the (4+2) annulation of allene reagents via a formal cycloaddition on internal &#960;&#8208;bond, which is challenging and remains elusive.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective stepwise (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished with synergetic catalysis by a combination of a gold&#8208;complex and a chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide (QN&#8208;SQA), leading to highly functionalized chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans in good to high yields with generally excellent enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the in situ formed alkylgold species is the key intermediate in this transformation, and the amide group served as a traceless directing group in this highly selective transformation. This method complements the enantioselective (4+2) annulation of allene reagents, providing the formal internal C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bond cycloaddition products, which is challenging and remains elusive.

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Framework Featuring Interactive Pockets for Bromine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine, a useful, although toxic halogen can coexist with I2 in an equilibrium product of IBr. Here, we propose a new Covalent Organic Framework (COF) featuring triple bonds, an electron&#8208;rich pyrene unit, and heteroatoms (N sites) to selectively capture Br2 over I2. The participation of the triple bond can be classified as a combined physisorption as well as chemisorption process, giving rise to a unique method for the capture of Br2.







Abstract
The high degree of corrosivity and reactivity of bromine, which is released from various sources, poses a serious threat to the environment. Moreover, its coexistence with iodine forming an equilibrium compound, iodine monobromide (IBr) necessitates the selective capture of bromine from halogen mixtures. The electrophilicity of halogens to &#960;&#8208;electron rich structures enabled us to strategically design a covalent organic framework for halogen capture, featuring a defined pore environment with localized sorption sites. The higher capture capacity of bromine (4.6&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) over iodine by ~41&#8201;% shows its potential in selective capture. Spectroscopic results uncovering the preferential interaction sites are supported by theoretical investigations. The alkyne bridge is a core functionality promoting the selectivity in capture by synergistic physisorption, rationalized by the higher orbital overlap of bromine due to its smaller atomic size as well as reversible chemical interactions. The slip stacking in the structure has further promoted this phenomenon by creating clusters of molecular interaction sites with bromine intercalated between the layers. The inclusion of unsaturated moieties, i.e. triple bonds and the complementary pore geometry offer a promising design strategy for the construction of porous materials for halogen capture.

The higher capture capacity of bromine (4.6&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) over iodine by ~41&#8201;% shows its potential in selective capture. Spectroscopic results uncovering the preferential interaction sites are supported by theoretical investigations. The alkyne bridge is a core functionality promoting the selectivity in capture by synergistic physisorption, rationalized by the higher orbital overlap of bromine due to its smaller atomic size as well as reversible chemical interactions. The slip stacking in the structure has further promoted this phenomenon by creating clusters of molecular interaction sites with bromine intercalated between the layers. The inclusion of unsaturated moieties, i.e. triple bonds and the complementary pore geometry offer a promising design strategy for the construction of porous materials for halogen capture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anomalous Structural Transformation of Cu(I) Clusters into Multifunctional CuAg Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a doping&#8208;induced, anomalous structural transformation in Cu nanoclusters and uncovered its capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unreported structures, properties and functionalities.







Abstract
We report an anomalous structural transformation of a Cu(I) cluster into two different types of copper&#8208;silver (CuAg) alloy nanoclusters. Different from previous reports, we demonstrate that under specifically designed reaction conditions, the Ag&#8208;doping could induce a substantial growth of the starting Cu15 and a Ag13Cu20 nanocluster was obtained via the unexpected insertion of an Ag13 kernel inside the Cu(I)&#8208;S shell. Ag13Cu20 demonstrates high activity to initiate the photopolymerization of previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;print inorganic polymers in 3D laser microprinting. Interestingly, a slight modification of the reaction condition leads to the formation of another Ag18&#8208;xCuxS (8&#8804;x) nanocluster templated by a central S2&#8722; anion, which possesses a unique electronic structure compared to conventional template&#8208;free CuAg nanoclusters. Overall, this work unveils the intriguing doping chemistry of Cu clusters, as well as their capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unobtainable structures and multifunctionality.

         <title>Cu1&#8722;Fe Dual Sites for Superior Neutral Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Cu is anchored on the oxide layer of Fe@Cu1FeOx to form Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites. The synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and the strengthened water activation on Cu sites decreases the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO hydrogenation, resulting in superior electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is able to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into reusable ammonia (NH3), offering a green treatment and resource utilization strategy of nitrate wastewater and ammonia synthesis. The conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3 undergoes water dissociation to generate active hydrogen atoms and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation tandemly. The two relay processes compete for the same active sites, especially under pH&#8208;neutral condition, resulting in the suboptimal efficiency and selectivity in the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;. Herein, we constructed a Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst by anchoring Cu single atoms on amorphous iron oxide shell of nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) for the electrochemical NO3RR, achieving an impressive NO3&#8722; removal efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% and NH3 selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% under neutral pH and nitrate concentration of 50&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;&#8722;N conditions, greatly surpassing the performance of nZVI counterpart. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and strengthened water activation on single&#8208;atom Cu sites, decreasing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH. This work develops a novel strategy of fabricating dual&#8208;site catalysts to enhance the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;, and presents an environmentally sustainable approach for neutral nitrate wastewater treatment.

A series of bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium(III) connected by naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) and perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) units have been prepared to determine the nature and strength of the (Cl)lone&#8208;pair&#8208;&#960; interactions between the chloride ligands and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties.

Abstract
A series of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) and perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) connected bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium(III) have been prepared and fully characterized. The analysis of their NMR spectroscopic features, together with their molecular structures show that these species display lone&#8208;pair&#8208;&#960; interactions between the chloride ligands of the Ir(III) complex and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties. The detection of this type of interaction in solution is due to the formation of two atropisomers, which are formed as a result of the restricted rotation about the Ir&#8722;Ccarbene bond imposed by the (Cl)lp&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR analysis allowed the determination of the strength of this non&#8208;covalent interaction, which lies between &#916;H=6.6 and 10&#8197;kcal/mol. The computational studies performed fully support the experimental findings.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;driven Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes with Diverse Solvation Configurations for All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Batteries always encounter uncontrollable failure or performance decay under extreme temperature environments, which is largely limited by the properties of electrolytes. Herein, an entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) with diverse solvation configurations is proposed to expand the operating temperature range of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The HEE possesses over 40 types of Zn2+ solvation structure with uniform distribution, contributing to its much higher solvation configurational entropy compared to the conventional aqueous counterpart (only 6 types). These effectively promotes its anti&#8208;freezing ability under ultralow temperatures, with a high ionic conductivity of 0.42 mS cm&#8208;1 even at a low temperature of &#8208;40 &#176;C. Moreover, the entropy&#8208;driven property can simultaneously enhance the thermal stability under a high temperature over +140 &#176;C. Therefore, the HEE can enable full cells stably working over a wide temperature range of &#8208;40~+80 &#176;C, performing over 1500 cycles with 100% capacity retention at &#8208;40 &#176;C and 1000 cycles with ~72% capacity retention at +80 &#176;C. This inspiring concept of entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte with quantized solvation configurational entropy value has charming potential for designing future special batteries with excellent adaptability towards extreme temperature environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an Organic Emitter Exhibiting Reverse Intersystem Crossing Faster than Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and suppression of intersystem crossing (ISC) are demanded to shorten a lifetime of triplet excitons. As a system realizing RISC faster than ISC, inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) with a negative energy difference (&#916;EST) between the lowest excited singlet and the lowest triplet states have been gathering much attention recently. Here, we have focused on an asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene (A6AP) core to obtain a new insight into iST. Based on A6AP, we have newly designed A6AP&#8208;Cz with the calculated &#916;EST of &#8722;44 meV. The experimental studies of a synthesized A6AP&#8208;Cz revealed that the lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) was only 54 ns, which was the shortest among all organic materials. The rate constant of RISC (kRISC = 1.9&#215;107 s&#8722;1) was greater than that of ISC (kISC = 1.0&#215;107 s&#8722;1). The negative &#916;EST of A6AP&#8208;Cz was experimentally confirmed from 1) the kRISC and kISC (&#8722;45 meV) and 2) the temperature&#8208;dependent &#964;DF. 3) The onsets of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at 77 K also supported the evidence of negative &#916;EST (&#8722;73 meV). This study demonstrated the potential of A6AP as an iST core for the first time.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)-based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and suppression of intersystem crossing (ISC) are demanded to shorten a lifetime of triplet excitons. As a system realizing RISC faster than ISC, inverted singlet-triplet excited states (iST) with a negative energy difference (&#916;EST) between the lowest excited singlet and the lowest triplet states have been gathering much attention recently. Here, we have focused on an asymmetric hexa-azaphenalene (A6AP) core to obtain a new insight into iST. Based on A6AP, we have newly designed A6AP-Cz with the calculated &#916;EST of &#8722;44 meV. The experimental studies of a synthesized A6AP-Cz revealed that the lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) was only 54 ns, which was the shortest among all organic materials.

         <title>BioLindlar Catalyst: Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Promoted Selective Bioreduction of Cyanoalkynes to Give (Z)&#8208;Cyanoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of alkenes from alkynes usually requires the use of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Unfortunately, efficient biocatalytic alternatives for this transformation have yet to be discovered. Herein, the selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to alkenes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) is described. Alkynes bearing ketone, aldehyde, ester, and nitrile moieties have been effectively reduced with excellent conversions and stereoselectivities, observing clear trends for the E/Z ratios depending on the nature of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group. In the case of cyanoalkynes, (Z)&#8208;alkenes were obtained as the major product, and the reaction scope was expanded to a wide variety of aromatic substrates (up to &gt;99% conversion, and Z/E stereoselectivities of up to &gt;99/1). Other alkynes containing aldehyde, ketone, or ester functionalities also proved to be excellent substrates, and interestingly gave the corresponding (E)&#8208;alkenes. Preparative biotransformations were performed on a 0.4 mmol scale, producing the desired (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes with good to excellent isolated yields (63&#8208;97%). This novel reactivity has been rationalised through molecular docking by predicting the binding poses of key molecules in the ERED&#8208;pu&#8208;0006 active site.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Synthesis of Non&#8208;Covalent Crosslinkers while Folding Single&#8208;Chain Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide folding is a dynamic process driven by non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking leading to functional nanostructures for essential biochemical activities. However, replicating this process in synthetic systems is challenging due to the difficulty in mimicking nature's real&#8208;time regulation of non&#8208;covalent crosslinking for single&#8208;chain polymer folding. Here, we address this by employing anionic dithiol building blocks to create macrocyclic disulfides as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers that adapted to the folding process. Initially, small macrocycles facilitated a low degree folding of a polycation. Then, this preorganized structure catalysed the production of larger macrocycles that enhanced the folding conversely. The self&#8208;adaptive synthesis was verified through the encapsulation of an anticancer drug, showing an updated production distribution of non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers and maximizing drug&#8208;loading efficiency against drug&#8208;resistant cancer in vitro. Our research advances the understanding of molecular systems by exploring species evolution via the structural dynamics of polymer folding. Additionally, adaptive synthesis enables controlled, sequential folding of synthetic polymers, with the potential to mimic protein functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Topology Control of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Interlaced Unsaturated 2D and Saturated 3D Units for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the electronic state of multicomponent covalent organic framework (COF) electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. However, the effect of dimensionality on their physicochemical functionalities is still lacking. Herein, we report an interlaced unsaturated 2D and saturated 3D strategy to develop multicomponent&#8208;regulated COFs with tunable gradient dimensionality for high selectivity and activity electrocatalysis. Compared with the two&#8208;component 2D and 3D model COFs, the 2D/3D framework interlaced COFs with locally irregular dimensions and electronic structures are more practical in optimizing the intrinsic electrode surface reaction and mass transfer. Remarkably, the unsaturated 2D&#8208;inserted 3D TAE&#8208;COF regulates the adsorption mode of OOH* species to supply a favorable dynamic pathway for the H2O2 process, thereby achieving an excellent production rate of 8.50 mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Moreover, utilizing theoretical calculation and in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR experiment, we found that the central carbon atom of the tetraphenyl&#8208;based unit&#160;(site&#8208;1 and site&#8208;6) are potential active sites. This strategy of operating the adsorption ability of reactants with dimensionality&#8208;interconnected building blocks provides an idea for designing durable and efficient electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Modular Click Chemistry Library through Sequential Ligations of Carboxylic Acids and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput synthesis and screening of chemical libraries play pivotal roles in drug discovery. Click chemistry has emerged as a powerful strategy for constructing highly modular chemical libraries. However, the development of new click reactions and unlocking  new click able building blocks remain exceedingly challenging. Here in , we describe a double&#8208;click strategy that enables the sequential ligation of widely available carboxylic acids and amines with fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSO  2  NCO) via a modular amidation/SuFEx process. This method provides facile access to chemical libraries of N&#8208;fluorosulfonyl amides (RCONHSO  2  F) and N&#8208;acylsulfamides (RCONHSO  2  NR &#180; R &#180;&#180; )  in near&#8208;quantitative yields  under simple and practical conditions. The robustness and efficiency of this double click strategy is showcased by the facile construction of chemical libraries in 96&#8208;well microtiter plates from a large number of carboxylic acids and amines. Preliminary biological activity screening reveals that some compound s &#160;exhibit  high antimicrobial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacterium &#160;S. aureus&#160;and drug&#8208;resistant MRSA&#160;(MIC up to 6.25&#183;&#956;g mL&#8208;1).&#160;These results provide compelling evidence for the potential application of modular click chemistry library as an enabling technology in high&#8208;throughput medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light (1200 nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium&#8208;Intercalated NiAl&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction (NIR&#8208;CO2PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO2 with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO2 photoreduction (0.887 &#956;mol h&#8722;1) with CO selectivity of 84.81% under 1200 nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98 eV) via a compression&#8208;related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light&#8208;induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO2PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO2 molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR&#8208;CO2PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR&#8208;CO2PR at wavelengths up to 1200 nm in LDH&#8208;based photocatalyst systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Functional Bonds Integrated Interphases for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4&#8208; is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6&#8208; in PC&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+&#8208;FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+&#8208;PC and participation of SN and PF6&#8208; anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3 Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4% after 1000 cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Edge&#8208;Rich Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ce Sites in CeO2 Supported Patchy Atomic&#8208;Layer Pt Enable a Non&#8208;CO Pathway for Efficient Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst that undergo non&#8208;CO pathway is essential to resolve the long&#8208;standing poisoning issue. However, it remains a huge challenge due to the rather difficulty in maximizing the non&#8208;CO pathway by the selective coupling between the key *CHO and *OH intermediates. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst of patchy atomic&#8208;layer Pt epitaxial growth on CeO2 nanocube (Pt ALs/CeO2) with maximum electron&#8208;metal support interactions for enhancing the coupling selectively. The small&#8208;size monolayer material achieves an optimal geometrical distance between edge Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ce sites and *OH absorbed on CeO2, which well restrains the dehydrogenation of *CHO, resulting in the non&#8208;CO pathway. Meanwhile, the *CHO/*CO intermediate generated at inner Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ce sites can migrate to edge, inducing the subsequent coupling reaction, thus avoiding poisoning while promoting reaction efficiency. Consequently, Pt ALs/CeO2 exhibits exceptionally catalytic stability with negligible degradation even under 1000 s pure CO poisoning operation and high mass activity (14.87 A/mgPt), enabling it one of the best&#8208;performing alkali&#8208;stable MOR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350 Wh kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4 g Ah&#8722;1) for 150 cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for the applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94:6 enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;accelerated Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Layer&#8208;stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layer&#8208;stacking behaviors are crucial for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) to define their pore structure, physicochemical properties, and functional output. So far, fine control over the stacking mode without complex procedures remains a grand challenge. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; strategy to synthesize 2D COFs with a tunable layer&#8208;stacking mode by taking advantage of ionic liquids (ILs). The staggered (AB) stacking (unlocked) COFs were exclusively obtained by incorporating ILs of symmetric polarity and matching molecular size; otherwise, commonly reported eclipsed (AA) stacking (locked) COFs were observed instead. Mechanistic study revealed that AB stacking was induced by a confined interlocking effect (CIE) brought by anions and bulky cations of the ILs inside pores (&#8220;key&#8221; and &#8220;cylinder&#8221;, respectively). Excitingly, this strategy can speed up production rate of crystalline powders (e.g., COF&#8208;TAPT&#8208;Tf@BmimTf2N in merely 30 minutes) under mild reaction conditions. This work highlights the enabling role of ILs to tailor the layer stacking of 2D COFs and promotes further exploration of their stacking mode&#8208;dependant applications.</dc:description>

Mechanistic study revealed that AB stacking was induced by a confined interlocking effect (CIE) brought by anions and bulky cations of the ILs inside pores (&#8220;key&#8221; and &#8220;cylinder&#8221;, respectively). Excitingly, this strategy can speed up production rate of crystalline powders (e.g., COF-TAPT-Tf@BmimTf2N in merely 30 minutes) under mild reaction conditions. This work highlights the enabling role of ILs to tailor the layer stacking of 2D COFs and promotes further exploration of their stacking mode-dependant applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Renal Clearable Nano&#8208;Assembly with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Amplified Superoxide Radical and Heat Generation&#160;to Overcome Hypoxia Resistance in Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given that type I photosensitizers (PSs) possess a good hypoxic tolerance, developing an innovative tactic to construct type I PSs is crucially important, but remains a challenge. Herein, we present a smart molecular design strategy based on the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism to develop a type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent with an encouraging amplification effect for accurate hypoxic tumor therapy. Of note, benefiting from the FRET effect, the obtained nanostructured type I PDT agent (NanoPcSZ) with boosted light&#8208;harvesting ability not only amplifies superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;) production but also promotes heat generation upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. These features facilitate NanoPcSZ to realize excellent phototherapeutic response under both normal and hypoxic environments. As a result, both in vitro and in vivo experiments achieved a remarkable improvement in therapeutic efficacy via the combined effect of photothermal action and type I photoreaction. Notably, NanoPcSZ can be eliminated from organs (including the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) apart from the tumor site and excreted through urine within 24 h of its systemic administration. In this way, the potential biotoxicity of drug accumulation can be avoided and the biosafety can be further enhanced.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular Duplexes Displaying Duplex&#8208;to&#8208;Duplex Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole (I)&#8211;pyridine (P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8211;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8225; = 22.0 kcal&#183;mol&#8722;1 at 75 &#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8211;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Benzylic C&#8211;H Etherification Enabled by Base&#8208;Promoted Halogen Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a benzylic C&#8211;H oxidative coupling reaction with alcohols that proceeds through a synergistic deprotonation, halogenation and substitution sequence. The combination of tert&#8208;butoxide bases with 2&#8208;halothiophene halogen oxidants enables the first general protocol for generating and using benzyl halides through a deprotonative pathway. In contrast to existing radical&#8208;based pathways for C&#8211;H functionalization, this process is guided by C&#8211;H acidity trends. This gives rise to new synthetic capabilities, including the ability to functionalize diverse methyl(hetero)arenes, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes and use of a double C&#8211;H etherification process to controllably oxidize methylarenes to benzaldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300 h, 1 mA cm&#8208;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5 A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible.
We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).</dc:description>

         <title>Micro&#8208;Ring Morphology of Ag7NCs and Light&#8208;Induced Reversible Interconversion of FCC Ag14NCs via Cu2+ ions&#8208;Mediated Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress made on intercluster conversion in atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) and their self&#8208;organization to develop microscopic molecular architecture with well&#8208;defined size and shape, achieving light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation and the development of micro&#8208;ring self&#8208;assembly in MNCs have, so far, remained elusive. The present investigation touches on these two long&#8208;standing quests by showcasing a new route, light&#8208;induced Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion (PARI) for the reversible transformation from Face Centered Cubic (FCC) Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. Our studies reveal that the lack of plasmonic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the system results in the formation of Ag7NCs with centrosymmetric metallic kernels having hexagonal crystal packing. The molecular self&#8208;organization of Ag7NCs through various non&#8208;covalent interactions such as C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O, C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H&#8208;C, and C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#7464; leads to the formation of micro&#8208;ring morphology, a unique molecular architecture in MNCs. The in&#8208;situ generated AgNPs due to the acceleration of the reaction kinetics by Cu2+ ions facilitate the growth of Ag14NCs with FCC metallic kernel. These two structural units of AgNCs show light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation which is also associated with the reversible tuning of their spectroscopic and morphological signatures. This PARI&#8208;guided interconversion strategy put forward a most appropriate example of a structure&#8208;property relationship in MNCs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable progress made on intercluster conversion in atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) and their self-organization to develop microscopic molecular architecture with well-defined size and shape, achieving light-induced reversible structural transformation and the development of micro-ring self-assembly in MNCs have, so far, remained elusive. The present investigation touches on these two long-standing quests by showcasing a new route, light-induced Particle-Assisted Reversible Interconversion (PARI) for the reversible transformation from Face Centered Cubic (FCC) Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. Our studies reveal that the lack of plasmonic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the system results in the formation of Ag7NCs with centrosymmetric metallic kernels having hexagonal crystal packing. The molecular self-organization of Ag7NCs through various non-covalent interactions such as C-H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O, C-H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H-C, and C-H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#7464; leads to the formation of micro-ring morphology, a unique molecular architecture in MNCs. The in-situ generated AgNPs due to the acceleration of the reaction kinetics by Cu2+ ions facilitate the growth of Ag14NCs with FCC metallic kernel.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the use of wet&#8208;spinning to 3D&#8208;print gels from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on the 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidenesorbitol (DBS) scaffold. Gel stripes assembled from DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 and DBS&#8208;COOH are printed, and their conductivities assessed. Printed gels based on DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 can be loaded with Au(III), which is reduced in situ to form embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The conductivity of these gels increases because of electron transport mediated by the AuNPs, whereas the conductivity of DBS&#8208;COOH, which does not promote AuNP formation, remains lower. We then fabricate multi&#8208;component gel patterns comprised of spatially well&#8208;defined domains of printed DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/AuNP (higher conductivity) and DBS&#8208;COOH (lower conductivity) resulting in soft multi&#8208;domain materials with differential conductivity. Such materials have future prospects in applications such as soft nanoelectronics or tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring compounds have been reported, seven&#8208;membered ring phosphepinium has not yet been fully studied. In this study, dithieno[2,3&#8208;b;3,2&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. This compound exhibited fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of 70 nm compared to phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. The theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Owing to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared with that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring effectively furnishes a px&#8208;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with the contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which is responsible for the intense emission with a large Stokes shift.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60 &#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were&#160; impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which was induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance,&#160;operate at temperatures &#8805;100 &#8451;, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1 % after 500 cycles and 93.5% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80 &#8451;. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3 V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9% at temperature as high as 120 &#8451;. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Dual Factor Activatable Covalent Targeted Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality in biomedical imaging with superior imaging depth and specificity. However, PAI still has significant limitations, such as the background noise from endogenous chromophores. To overcome these limitations, we developed a covalent activity&#8208;based PAI probe, NOx&#8208;JS013, targeting NCEH1. NCEH1, a highly expressed and activated serine hydrolase in aggressive cancers, has the potential to be employed for the diagnosis of cancers. We show that NOx&#8208;JS013 labels active NCEH1 in live cells with high selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. NOx&#8208;JS013 also presents its efficacy as a hypoxia&#8208;responsive imaging probe in live cells. Finally, NOx&#8208;JS013 successfully visualizes aggressive prostate cancer tumors in mouse models of PC3, while negligibly detected in tumors of non&#8208;aggressive LNCaP mouse models. These findings show that NOx&#8208;JS013 has the potential to be used to develop precision PAI reagents for detecting metastatic progression in various cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites' physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites' intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted "figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight" shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8208;2 g&#183;mg&#8208;1&#183;min&#8208;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention owing to their frequent occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals and insecticides. However, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and long&#8208;standing goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl electrophiles to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups were crucial for attaining high reactivity and selectivity. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access. Furthermore, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Full Battery with Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesize the rare earth metal Sm SACs on N&#8208;doped carbon substrate. Theoretical calculations and experimental results both indicate that the Sm SACs have the structure of Sm&#8208;N3C3. With this design, the 4f orbital polarizes the 5d orbital, the electronic states near dxz/yz increases, and the d orbital achieves a maximized overlap with the p orbital when interacting with LiPSs, resulting in an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization which provides high activity for accelerating LiPSs reaction kinetics and Li homogeneous deposition.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have many advantages but still face problems such as retarded polysulfides redox kinetics and Li dendrite growth. Most reported single atom catalysts (SACs) for Li&#8722;S batteries are based on d&#8208;band transition metals whose d orbital constitutes active valence band, which is inclined to occur catalyst passivation. SACs based on 4f inner valence orbital of rare earth metals are challenging for their great difficulty to be activated. In this work, we design and synthesize the first rare earth metal Sm SACs which has electron&#8208;rich 4f inner orbital to promote catalytic conversion of polysulfides and uniform deposition of Li. Sm SACs enhance the catalysis by the activated 4f orbital through an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Using Sm&#8208;N3C3 modified separators, the half cells deliver a high capacity over 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a retention rate of 84.3&#8201;% after 2000 cycles. The fabricated Sm&#8208;N3C3&#8208;Li|Sm&#8208;N3C3@PP|S/CNTs full batteries can provide an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of a retention rate of 80.6&#8201;% at 0.2&#8201;C after 100 cycles, one of the best full Li&#8722;S batteries. This work provides a new perspective for the development of rare earth metal single atom catalysis in electrochemical reactions of Li&#8722;S batteries and other electrochemical systems for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Carboxylesterase Activatable Molecular Probe for Personalized Treatment Guidance by Analyte&#8208;Induced Molecular Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared fluorescence/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode molecular probe with high specificity and responsiveness of carboxylesterase was developed through the analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation strategy.







Abstract
Accurate visualization of tumor microenvironment is of great significance for personalized medicine. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) dual&#8208;mode molecular probe (denoted as NIR&#8722;CE) for distinguishing tumors based on carboxylesterase (CE) level by an analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation (AIMT) strategy. The recognition moiety for CE activity is the acetyl unit of NIR&#8722;CE, generating the pre&#8208;product, NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;OH, which undergoes spontaneous hydrogen atom exchange between the nitrogen atoms in the indole group and the phenol hydroxyl group, eventually transforming into NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;H. In cellular experiments and in vivo blind studies, the human hepatoma cells and tumors with high level of CE were successfully distinguished by both NIR FL and PA imaging. Our findings provide a new molecular imaging strategy for personalized treatment guidance.

         <title>An Enzymatic Prodrug&#8208;like Route to Thio and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic route to thioamides was elucidated as part of the biosynthesis of the antimetabolite 6&#8208;thioguanine in plant&#8208;pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, an adenylating enzyme forms an intermediate cysteine&#8208;S&#8208;conjugate that is cleaved by a designated C&#8722;S lyase, a process that mirrors a prodrug approach in cancer therapy.







Abstract
6&#8208;Thioguanine (6TG) is a clinically used antitumor agent that was rationally designed as a DNA&#8208;targeting antimetabolite, but it also occurs naturally. 6TG is a critical virulence factor produced by Erwinia amylovorans, a notorious plant pathogen that causes fire blight of pome fruit trees. The biosynthesis of the rare thioamide metabolite involves an adenylating enzyme (YcfA) and a sulfur&#8208;mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), but the mechanism of sulfur transfer and putative intermediates have remained elusive. Through dissection and in vitro reconstitution of the thionation process using diverse substrates, we uncover an intermediate, prodrug&#8208;like thio&#8208;conjugate and elucidate the precise enzyme functions. YcfA not only adenylates GMP but also transfers the mercapto group of l&#8208;cysteine to the activated carbonyl. A designated C&#8722;S lyase (YcfC) then cleaves the resulting S&#8208;adduct to yield the thioamide. This pathway is distinct from canonical tRNA sulfur modifications and known enzymatic peptide thionations. By exploring a wide range of substrate surrogates, we exploited the tolerance of the enzyme pair to produce even a seleno analog. This study provides valuable insight into a previously unexplored area of bacterial thioamide formation and lays the groundwork for synthetic biology approaches to produce thioamide antimetabolites.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Bond Crosslinking Strategy Enabling Resilient and Recyclable Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy is proposed for solid polymer electrolytes to decouple their trade&#8208;off relationships among mechanical, recyclable and conductive properties. The elastically resilient, chemically recyclable and highly conductive solid polymer electrolyte enables 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;class and room&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries with stable cyclability, high rate&#8208;capability and recyclability.







Abstract
Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface issues of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade&#8208;offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+&#8208;dissociation co&#8208;polymer chains, where the &#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208; bond maintains the load&#8208;bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non&#8208;spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction.

     alt="A Dual-Bond Crosslinking Strategy Enabling Resilient and Recyclable Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dual-bond crosslinking strategy&lt;/b&gt; is proposed for solid polymer electrolytes to decouple their trade-off relationships among mechanical, recyclable and conductive properties. The elastically resilient, chemically recyclable and highly conductive solid polymer electrolyte enables 4.3&#8197;V-class and room-temperature Li metal batteries with stable cyclability, high rate-capability and recyclability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid-solid-interface issues of solid-state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade-offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual-bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dissociation co-polymer chains, where the &#8722;C&#8722;N- bond maintains the load-bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non-spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading-unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (25&#8201;&#176;C) and chemical recyclability. Then, exceptional room-temperature performances are obtained for repeated Li plating/stripping tests, and stable cycling of LMBs with either LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or 4.3&#8197;V-class LiFe&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode. Furthermore, the recycled and reprocessed SPEs can be circularly reused in LMBs without significant performance degradation. Our findings provide an inspiring design principle for SPEs to address the solid-solid-interface and sustainability challenges of solid-state LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acetal&#8208;thiol Click&#8208;like Reaction: Facile and Efficient Synthesis of Dynamic Dithioacetals and Recyclable Polydithioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction with high conversion, &gt; acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, and high universality, applicable to all typical types of acetals and thiols, was discovered for the facile synthesis of dynamic dithioacetals and readily recyclable polymers without catalyst and solvent. It provides a green and high&#8208;efficient reaction for the sustainable development of organic, polymer, material, medical chemistries, etc.







Abstract
Dithioacetals are heavily used in organic, material and medical chemistries, and exhibit huge potential to synthesize degradable or recyclable polymers. However, the current synthetic approaches of dithioacetals and polydithioacetals are overwhelmingly dependent on external catalysts and organic solvents. Herein, we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction for synthesizing dithioacetals and polydithioacetals. High conversion, higher than acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, can be achieved. High universality was confirmed by monitoring the reactions of linear and cyclic acetals (including renewable bio&#8208;sourced furan&#8208;acetal) with aliphatic and aromatic thiols, and the reaction mechanism of monomolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and auto&#8208;protonation (activation) by thiol was clarified by combining experiments and density functional theory computation. Subsequently, we utilize this reaction to synthesize readily recyclable polydithioacetals. By simple heating and stirring, linear polydithioacetals with 

M&#8254;

 ${\bar M}$



w of ~110&#8197;kDa were synthesized from acetal and dithiol, and depolymerization into macrocyclic dithioacetal and repolymerization into polydithioacetal can be achieved; through reactive extrusion, a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer dynamic network with excellent mechanical properties and continuous reprocessability was prepared from poly(vinyl butyral) and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). This green and high&#8208;efficient synthesis method for dithioacetals and polydithioacetals is beneficial to the sustainable development of chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Regulate Zinc Plating/Stripping Behaviors for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent PBSC interface is designed on the zinc anode with self&#8208;adaptation and shear&#8208;thickening properties by blending polyborosiloxane (PBS) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The reversible association/disassociation of dynamic B&#8722;O bonds enhances local structural integrity, effectively impeding continuous zinc dendrite growth and mitigating hydrogen evolution, ensuring stable zinc plating/stripping behaviors with enhanced cycling performance.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces provide a comprehensive approach to controlling zinc dendrite and surface corrosion in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, due to consistent volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, traditional interfacial layers cannot consistently adapt to the dendrite surface, resulting in uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution. Herein, dynamic covalent bonds exhibit the Janus effect towards zinc deposition at different current densities, presenting a holistic strategy for stabilizing zinc anode. The PBSC intelligent artificial interface consisting of dynamic B&#8722;O covalent bonds is developed on zinc anode to mitigate hydrogen evolution and restrict dendrite expansion. Owing to the reversible dynamic bonds, PBSC exhibits shape self&#8208;adaptive characteristics at low current rates, which rearranges the network to accommodate volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, resisting hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the rapid association of B&#8722;O dynamic bonds enhances mechanical strength at dendrite tips, presenting a shear&#8208;thickening effect and suppressing further dendrite growth at high current rates. Therefore, the assembled symmetrical battery with PBSC maintains a stable cycle of 4500&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation and the PBSC@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates a specific capacity exceeding 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the intelligent interface with dynamic covalent bonds provides innovative approaches for zinc anode interfacial engineering and enhances cycling performance.

         <title>Anion Modulation of Ag&#8208;Imidazole Cuboctahedral Cage Microenvironments for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have fabricated three Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral coordination cages (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) which exhibit inner/outside coordination microenvironments, and metal/nonmetal active sites for synergistic enhancement of selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes.







Abstract
How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal&#8208;organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well&#8208;defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self&#8208;assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;benzylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzene (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes of 86.1&#8201;% (acidic), 94.1&#8201;% (neutral) and 95.3&#8201;% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;ClO4 and Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag&#8208;site is stabilized by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen&#8208;bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag&#8208;centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag&#8208;coordination geometry and host&#8211;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.

         <title>Fabrication of Coffee&#8208;Ring Nanostructured Membranes for Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization to construct coffee&#8208;ring structured the membrane. These features render 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective filtration area of the membrane, and thereby realizing a 2.7&#8208;fold boost in the MeOH permeance. Moreover, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) plays important roles in pharmaceutical ingredients purification and solvent recovery. However, the low organic solvent permeance under cross&#8208;flow operation of OSN membrane hampers their industrial applications. Herein, we report the construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane featuring high OSN permeance. A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization. Owing to the diffusion of EtOH to n&#8208;hexane, coffee&#8208;ring nanostructure on the support membrane appeared, which served as the template for construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane. The optimal nanostructured membrane demonstrated 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective surface area with reduced membrane thickness. Resultantly, the membrane afforded a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in organic solvent permeance, e.g., ~13&#8197;LMH/bar for MeOH, without sacrificing the rejection ability. Moreover, due to the rigid monomer structure, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.

&lt;p&gt;A water-insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization to construct coffee-ring structured the membrane. These features render 2.6-fold enhancement in the effective filtration area of the membrane, and thereby realizing a 2.7-fold boost in the MeOH permeance. Moreover, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) plays important roles in pharmaceutical ingredients purification and solvent recovery. However, the low organic solvent permeance under cross-flow operation of OSN membrane hampers their industrial applications. Herein, we report the construction of coffee-ring structured membrane featuring high OSN permeance. A water-insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization. Owing to the diffusion of EtOH to n-hexane, coffee-ring nanostructure on the support membrane appeared, which served as the template for construction of coffee-ring structured membrane. The optimal nanostructured membrane demonstrated 2.6-fold enhancement in the effective surface area with reduced membrane thickness. Resultantly, the membrane afforded a 2.7-fold enhancement in organic solvent permeance, e.g., ~13&#8197;LMH/bar for MeOH, without sacrificing the rejection ability. Moreover, due to the rigid monomer structure, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrated Design for Discrete Sulfur@Polymer Nanoreactor with Tandem Connection as Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of transistor integration, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining NS in conductive polymer reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete nanoreactor units bonded on CNTs. Meanwhile, excellent performance is achieved through tandem connection with CNTs, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs.







Abstract
Apart from electrode material modification, architecture design and optimization are important approaches for improving lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. Herein, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining nanosulfur (NS) in conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete independent nanoreactor units bonded onto carbon nanotubes (noted as CNT/NS@PEDOT). The unique spatial confinement and concentration gradients of sulfur@PEDOT nanoreactors (SP&#8208;NRs) can promote reaction kinetics while facilitating rapid polysulfide transformation and minimizing dissolution and diffusion losses. Meanwhile, overall ultrahigh energy input and output are achieved through tandem connection with carbon nanotubes, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs. As a result, it delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1246&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C and 918&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8201;C, the low capacity decay rate per lap of 0.011&#8201;% is achieved at a current density of 1&#8201;C after 1000 cycles. This research emphasizes the innovative structural design to provide a fresh trajectory for the further advancement of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Stereoinvertive SN1 Through Neighboring Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel classification for stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution through neighboring group participation is presented. Three disctinct modes have been identified: Inversion via Rearrangements, Invertive Intermediate&#8208;Retentive Ring&#8208;opening and Retentive Intermediate&#8208;Invertive Substitution. In each instance, we have elucidated the fundamental principles underlying the stereochemistry and provided representative examples to illustrate the concepts.







Abstract
Neighboring group participation, the assistance of non&#8208;conjugated electrons to a reaction center, is a fundamental phenomenon in chemistry. In the framework of nucleophilic substitution reactions, neighboring group participation is known to cause rate acceleration, first order kinetics (SN1), and retention of configuration. The latter phenomenon is a result of double inversion: the first one when the neighboring group displaces the leaving group, and the second when a nucleophile substitutes the neighboring group. This powerful control of stereoretention has been widely used in organic synthesis for more than a century. However, neighboring group participation may also lead to inversion of configuration, a phenomenon which is often overlooked. Herein, we review this unique mode of stereoinversion, dividing the relevant reactions into three classes with the aim to introduce a fresh perspective on the different modes of stereoinversion via neighboring group participation as well as the factors that control this stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Cobaltaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was devised to access molecules with central and axial chirality with up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio. The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalysis was enabled by highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, enantioselective electrocatalysis has surfaced as an increasingly&#8208;effective platform for sustainable molecular synthesis. Despite indisputable progress, strategies that allow the control of two distinct stereogenic elements with high selectivity remain elusive. In contrast, we, herein, describe electrochemical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations that enable the installation of chiral stereogenic centers along with a chiral axis with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. The developed electrocatalysis strategy allowed for C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H activations/annulations with cyclic and non&#8208;cyclic alkenes providing expedient access to various central as well as atropo&#8208;chiral dihydroisoquinolinones paired to the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction. Studies on the atropo&#8208;stability of the obtained compounds demonstrated that the exceedingly mild conditions ensured by the electrocatalytic process were key for the achieved high stereoselectivities.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: 2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radicals, in collaboration with water molecules, drive the breakage of V&#8208;F&#8208;V bonds in bulk phase phosphate and subsequently form a new 2D phosphate through recoordination, as reported by Xing&#8208;Long Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402371). The 2D phosphate exhibits superior carrier transport capability, lower Na+ migration barriers, and reduced volumetric strain, endowing it with excellent fast charging characteristics as sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. This effective strategy will provide a new insight for the optimization of SIBs.

         <title>Cover Picture: Size and Polarizability of Boron Cluster Carriers Modulate Chaotropic Membrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic boron clusters have been systematically studied to understand the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos across lipid membranes and inside cells. In their Research Article (e202404286), Irene Lostal&#233;&#8208;Seijo, Werner M. Nau, Javier Montenegro et al. showed that size and polarizability are more important than the chemical composition of the clusters, establishing the bases for the prediction of their carrier potential and toxicity.

         <title>Streamlining the Synthesis of Pyridones through Oxidative Amination of Cyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the development of an oxidative amination process for the streamlined synthesis of pyridones from cyclopentenones. Cyclopentenone building blocks can undergo in situ silyl enol ether formation, followed by the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the carbon skeleton with successive aromatisation to yield pyridones. The reaction sequence is operationally simple, rapid, and carried out in one pot. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, complete regioselectivity, and is well scalable. The developed method provides facile access to the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labelled targets, industrially relevant pyridone products and their derivatives in a fast and efficient way.</dc:description>

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsisfici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS's function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000 h (&gt; 8 months) at a current density of 3 mA cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanometer&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Organic Cation Migration Behavior in Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance and stability of organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) optoelectronic devices have been associated with ion migration. Understanding of nanoscale resolved organic cation migration mechanism would facilitate structure engineering and commercialization of OMHP. Here, we report a three&#8208;dimensional approach for in situ nanoscale infrared imaging of organic ion migration behavior in OMHPs, enabling to distinguish migrations along grain boundary and in crystal lattice. Our results reveal that organic cation migration along OMHP film surface and grain boundaries (GBs) occurs at lower biases than in crystal lattice. We visualize the transition of organic cation migration channels from GBs to volume upon increasing electric field. The temporal resolved results demonstrate the fast MA+ migration kinetics at GBs, which is comparable to diffusivity of halide ions. Our findings help understand the role of organic cations in the performance of OMHP devices, and the proposed approach holds broad applicability for revealing migration mechanisms of organic ions in OMHPs based optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the self&#8208;assembly of homosupramolecules, the self&#8208;assembly of heterosupramolecules is more challenging and significant in various fields. Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerisation using an arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy. Moreover, the resulting heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane structure. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system, not only contributing to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriching synthetic methodologies of mechanically interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we have evidenced the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;hole Br&#183;&#183;&#183;metal noncovalent interactions (NCIs) involving elements from groups 9, 11 and 12. More in detail, M (M = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) containing porphyrins have been synthesized and their supramolecular assemblies structurally characterized by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses, revealing the formation of directional Br&#183;&#183;&#183;M contacts in addition to ancillary hydrogen bond and lone pair&#8208;&#960; bonds. Computations at the PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory revealed the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of the Br&#183;&#183;&#183;M interaction. In addition, the physical nature of these NCIs was studied using Quantum Chemistry methodologies, providing evidence of &#960;&#8208;hole Spodium and Regium bonds in Zn2+ and Cu2+ porphyrins, in addition to unveiling the presence of &#160;a &#960;&#8208;hole for group 9 (Co2+). On the other hand, group 10 (Ni2+) acted as both electron donor and acceptor moiety without showing an electropositive &#960;&#8208;hole. Owing to the underexplored potential of &#960;&#8208;hole interactions in transition metal chemistry, we believe the results reported herein will be useful in supramolecular chemistry, organometallics, and solid&#8208;state chemistry by i) putting under the spotlight the &#960;&#8208;hole chemistry involving first row transition metals and ii) unlocking a new tool to direct the self&#8208;assembly of metalloporphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphetene&#8208;based polyaromatics: structure&#8208;property relationships and chiroptical tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended phosphetene rings (4&#8208;member P&#8208;rings) flanked with PAH systems of various topologies. These compounds are fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction. The impact of both the polyaromatic platform and the P&#8208;ring on the structure, and the optical and redox properties are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Although neither the P centre nor the 4&#8208;membered ring significantly takes part in the HOMO or LUMO orbitals, both structural features have an important modulating role in distorting the symmetry of the orbitals, leading to chiroptical properties. The stereogenic P&#8208;atom is used as a remote chiral perturbator to induce circularly polarized luminescence of the polyaromatic system. The dissymmetry factor is highly dependent on the polyaromatic topology, as supported by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation of One&#8208;Dimensional Wires: The Case of Long Oligoynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show an unexpected aggregation phenomenon of a long oligoyne (Py[16]) with 16 contiguous triple bonds and endcapped with bulky 3,5&#8208;bi(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)pyridine groups. Aggregation of 1D p&#8208;conjugated oligoyne chains is rare, given the minimal p&#8208;p intermolecular interactions of the weakly polarizable polyyne chain, as well as its flexibility that works against self assembly. In dilute solutions, the reversible aggregation of Py[16] initiates at low temperature in the range of 140&#8211;180 K, and is not observed for shorter oligoynes in this series. Cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis electronic absorption spectra and vibrational Raman spectra with different laser wavelength lines tuning from in&#8208;resonance to off&#8208;resonance conditions have been used to extract the vibrational features characterizing the Monomer and aggregate species. Theoretical calculations complement the spectroscopic findings.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks, however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4'&#8208;Vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together via dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has covalent organic nanoribbon, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated as an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).</dc:description>

         <title>Asynchronous Ring Opening of Cyclic Carbonate and Glycidyl Ether Induced Phase Evolution Towards Heat&#8208;free and Rapid&#8208;bonding Superior Epoxy Adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural adhesives that do not require heating are in high demand in the automotive and electronics industries. However, it remains a challenge to develop robust adhesives that rapidly achieve super adhesion near ambient temperature. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature curable, fast&#8208;bonding, and super strong epoxy&#8208;based structural adhesive was designed from the perspective of cross&#8208;scale structure, which lies in threefold pivotal aspects: (i) high branching topology of glycerol carbonate&#8208;capped polyurethane (PUGC) increases the kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reaction, contributing to fast crosslinking and the formation of abundant urethane and hydroxyl moieties; (ii) asynchronous crosslinking of epoxy and PUGC synergistically induces phase separation of PUGC within the epoxy resin and the resulting PUGC domains surrounded by interpenetrated shell serves to efficiently toughen the matrix; (iii) abundant dynamic hydrogen bonds including urethane and hydroxyl moieties, along with the elastomeric PUGC domains, dissipate energy of shearing force. As a result, the adhesive strength rapidly grows to 16 MPa within 4 hours, leveling off to 21 MPa after 7 hours, substantially outperforming commercial room&#8208;temperature curable epoxy adhesives. The results of this study could advance the field of high&#8208;performance adhesives and provide valuable insights into designing materials for efficient curing at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Frameworks with Controlled and Uniform Pore Apertures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod&#8208;like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D&#8208;Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1 nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well&#8208;defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size&#8208;fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exoPBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9 kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93 &#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620 nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850 nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.01 eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Combining Best Properties of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis in Hybrid Pd/NHC Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores the formation of hybrid nanoscale metal species from molecular precatalysts, which exhibit the unique attributes of molecular complexes and nanoparticles. This study addresses their detection difficulties and introduces solid&#8208;state NMR to demonstrate the generation of catalytically active Pd nanoparticles from Pd/NHC complexes. The findings underscore the critical role of NHC ligands in catalytic nanoparticle system stability and activity.







Abstract
The formation of transient hybrid nanoscale metal species from homogeneous molecular precatalysts has been demonstrated by in situ NMR studies of catalytic reactions involving transition metals with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (M/NHC). These hybrid structures provide benefits of both molecular complexes and nanoparticles, enhancing the activity, selectivity, flexibility, and regulation of active species. However, they are challenging to identify experimentally due to the unsuitability of standard methods used for homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. Utilizing a sophisticated solid&#8208;state NMR technique, we provide evidence for the formation of NHC&#8208;ligated catalytically active Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) from Pd/NHC complexes during catalysis. The coordination of NHCs via C(NHC)&#8722;Pd bonding to the metal surface was first confirmed by observing the Knight shift in the 13C NMR spectrum of the frozen reaction mixture. Computational modeling revealed that as little as few NHC ligands are sufficient for complete ligation of the surface of the formed PdNPs. Catalytic experiments combined with in situ NMR studies confirmed the significant effect of surface covalently bound NHC ligands on the catalytic properties of the PdNPs formed by decomposition of the Pd/NHC complexes. This observation shows the crucial influence of NHC ligands on the activity and stability of nanoparticulate catalytic systems.

         <title>Discovery of Alloy Catalysts Beyond Pd for Selective Hydrogenation of Reformate via First&#8208;Principle Screening with Consideration of H&#8208;Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the consideration of H coverage effect, the activity of reformate hydrogenation was evaluated according to descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energy of atomic hydrogen, and the selectivity was determined based on adsorption energy of benzene. 172 stable alloys were scanned, and Zn3Ir1 alloy was found to present high performance, which was verified by experiments.







Abstract
The highly selective hydrogenation to remove olefins is a significant refining approach for the reformate. Herein, a library of transition metal for reformate hydrogenation is tested experimentally to validate the predictive level of catalytic activity from our theoretical framework, which combines ab initio calculations and microkinetic modeling, with consideration of surface H&#8208;coverage effect on hydrogenation kinetics. The favorable H coverage of specific alloy surface under relevant hydrogenation condition, is found to be determined by its corresponding alloy composition. Besides, olefin hydrogenation rate is determined as a function of two descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energies of atomic hydrogen, paving the way to computationally screen on metal component in the periodic table. Evaluation of 172 bimetallic alloys based on the activity volcano map, as well as benzene hydrogenation rate, identifies prospective superior candidates and experimentally confirms that Zn3Ir1 outperforms pure Pd catalysts for the selective hydrogenation refining of reformate. The insights into H&#8208;coverage&#8208;related microkinetic modelling have enabled us to both theoretically understand experimental findings and identify novel catalysts, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principle simulations and industrial applications. This work provides useful guidance for experimental catalyst design, which can be easily extended to other hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Structural Fine Tuning of Chromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine tuning color through optical band structure and interfaces: Through anaerobic pyrolysis, generation of rare earth oxide&#8208;reduced carbon interfaces allows for tunability and convergence in color from optical band structure to structural evolution. Herein, we show Ho3+ ions which start pink in nature and undergo transitions in luminosity and chromaticity to black, illustrating the role of structure, composition, and processing conditions.







Abstract
Lanthanoid carboxylates were synthesized and in situ self&#8208;assembled to illustrate temperature&#8208;driven evolution in chromaticity. Evolution in structure (crystallinity), composition, luminosity, and chromaticity were investigated revealing the coupled role of divergence in order/structure (spatial organization), and composition in tuning observed color. Loss of crystallinity or increase in residual carbon leads to decrease in luminosity even with increase in hue. Comparing Ho and Er congeners shows that the density of accessible transition states relates to shifts in low and high wavelength components of color. This work demonstrates that, just as interface dipoles can lead to change in semiconductor band gap, structure and composition can analogously alter observed color.

         <title>Ideal Cage&#8208;like Pores for Molecular Sieving of Butane Isomers with High Purity and Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework with small windows and large cavities exhibit not only exclusive adsorption for iso&#8208;C4H10 but also record&#8208;high adsorption for n&#8208;C4H10. High&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) and n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) with record productivities can be obtained respectively from separation and desorption process.







Abstract
n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 are both important petrochemical raw materials. Considering the coexistence of the isomers in the production process, it is necessary to achieve their efficient separation through an economical way. However, to obtain high&#8208;purity n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 in one&#8208;step separation process, developing iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion adsorbents with high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity is crucial. Herein, we report a cage&#8208;like MOF (SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA) with small windows and large cavities which can selectively allow smaller n&#8208;C4H10 enter the pore and accommodate a large amount of n&#8208;C4H10 simultaneously. Adsorption isotherms reveal that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA not only completely excludes iso&#8208;C4H10 in a wide temperature range, but also exhibits a very high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity of 94.2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;kPa and 298&#8197;K, which is the highest value among iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion&#8208;type adsorbents. Breakthrough experiments show that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has excellent n/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation performance and can achieve a record&#8208;high productivity of iso&#8208;C4H10 (3.2&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with high purity (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) as well as 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) in one separation circle. More importantly, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can realize the efficient separation of butanes at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as under high humid condition, which indicates that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can be deemed as an ideal platform for industrial butane isomers separation.

         <title>Adhesion Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Biobased Microgels for Controlled Delivery of Pesticides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pectin microgels with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) are introduced as a biobased pesticide delivery system. Using Cu2+, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevent grapevine downy mildew, matching commercial pesticides. We developed biadhesive anchor peptides that self&#8208;assemble on pectin microgels and ensure tight leaf binding, providing rain resistance and prolonged fungicidal activity. P&#8208;MAPs easily degrade with natural enzymes, minimizing environmental impact.







Abstract
Widespread use of plant protection agents in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. Apart from active ingredients, the environmental impact of auxiliary synthetic polymers should be minimized if they are highly persistent. An alternative to synthetic polymers is the use of natural polysaccharides, which are abundant and biodegradable. In this study, we explore pectin microgels functionalized with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) to be used as an alternative biobased pesticide delivery system. Using copper as the active ingredient, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevented infection of grapevine plants with downy mildew under semi&#8208;field conditions on par with commercial copper pesticides. By using anchor peptides, the microgels tightly bind to the leaf surface, exhibiting excellent rain fastness and prolonged fungicidal activity. Finally, P&#8208;MAPs are shown to be easily degradable by enzymes found in nature, demonstrating their negligible long&#8208;term impact on the environment.

         <title>Atomic Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Cadmium Sulfide for Photocatalytic Production of Amino Acids from Biomass Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts loaded on ultrathin CdS nanosheets (Ru1/CdS), which efficiently catalyze biomass&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to produce amino acids under visible light irradiation. The optimal system predominates the conventional thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems in terms of conversion, selectivity, yield, and amino acid formation rates.







Abstract
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as important ingredients for other nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Here, we report the sustainable production of amino acids from biomass&#8208;derived hydroxy acids with high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation and mild conditions, using atomic ruthenium&#8208;promoted cadmium sulfide (Ru1/CdS). On a metal basis, the optimized Ru1/CdS exhibits a maximal alanine formation rate of 26.0&#8197;molAla&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 1.7&#8197;times and more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of its nanoparticle counterpart and the conventional thermocatalytic process, respectively. Integrated spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations attribute the high performance of Ru1/CdS to the facilitated charge separation and O&#8722;H bond dissociation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy group, here of lactic acid. The operando nuclear magnetic resonance further infers a unique &#8220;double activation&#8221; mechanism of both the CH&#8722;OH and CH3&#8722;CH&#8722;OH structures in lactic acid, which significantly accelerates its photocatalytic amination toward alanine.

         <title>The Role of the Molecular Encapsulation Effect in Stabilizing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Rich Gel&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes modulates the activity of the active hydrogen atoms by the formation of the molecular encapsulation effect, thereby suppressing the interfacial side reactions. With this strategy, we achieved stable operation of a practical 1.1&#8197;Ah gel&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cell.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes with superior mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing abilities and high Li+ transference numbers can be obtained by in situ polymerization of monomers with hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. However, it is overlooked that the active hydrogen atoms in hydrogen&#8208;bond donors experience displacement reactions with lithium metal in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), leading to corrosion of the lithium metal. Herein, it is discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;rich gel&#8208;state electrolytes modulates the chemical activity of the active hydrogen atoms via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded intermolecular interactions. The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3&#8201;% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel&#8208;state&#8208;based LMBs.

The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen-bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1&#8197;Ah LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3&#8201;% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel-state-based LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging Atom Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Activation in a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>

         <dc:description>
Tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. This variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation.







Abstract
Achieving active site engineering at the atomic level poses a significant challenge in the design and optimization of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient catalytic processes, especially for a reaction with two reactants competitively absorbed on catalytic active sites. Herein, we show an example that tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that this variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation. As a result, exceptional low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation performance was achieved with T25(Temperature for 25&#8201;% conversion)=35&#8201;&#176;C and T100 (Temperature for 100&#8201;% conversion)=150&#8201;&#176;C, which stands out from existing MOF&#8208;based catalysts and even rivals many noble metal catalysts. This work provides a guidance for the rational design of catalysts for efficient oxygen activation for an oxidation reaction.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Coordination Foldamer&#8208;Based Polymer Network: from Molecular Spring to Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks with high&#8208;density molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination foldamers as monomer. This endows the materials with excellent energy dissipation and elasticity through folding and unfolding of foldamer. With increasing number of repeating units in the foldamer, the corresponding polymer network shows better mechanical performance as well as shape memory feature.







Abstract
Foldamer is a scaled&#8208;down version of coil spring, which can absorb and release energy by conformational change. Here, polymer networks with high density of molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based foldamers as the monomer. The coiling of the foldamer is controlled by oligo(urea) ligands coordinating to chloride ions; subsequently, the folding and unfolding of foldamer conformations endow the polymer network with excellent energy dissipation and toughness. The mechanical performance of the corresponding polymer networks shows a dramatic increase from P&#8208;L2UCl (non&#8208;folding), to P&#8208;L4UCl (a full turn), and then to P&#8208;L6UCl (1.5 turns), in terms of strength (2.62&#8197;MPa; 14.26&#8197;MPa; 22.93&#8197;MPa), elongation at break (70&#8201;%; 325&#8201;%; 352&#8201;%), Young's modulus (2.69&#8197;MPa; 63.61&#8197;MPa; 141.50&#8197;MPa), and toughness (1.12&#8197;MJ/m3; 21.39&#8197;MJ/m3; 49.62&#8197;MJ/m3), respectively, which is also better than those without anion centers and the non&#8208;foldamer based counterparts. Moreover, P&#8208;L6UCl shows enhanced strength and toughness than most of the molecular&#8208;spring based polymer networks. Thus, an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based materials is presented.

         <title>Chemoselective Proteomics, Zinc Fingers, and a Zinc(II) Model for H2S Mediated Persulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persulfidation by H2S is a key modification of proteins. Using persulfide specific proteomics, cysteine rich zinc finger (ZF) proteins were found to be targets of persulfidation. The reaction of H2S with ZFs was evaluated using a series of ZFs and a small molecule ZnII coordination complex that mimics the ZF site. Persulfidation by H2S occurred in an O2 dependent manner, with the zinc acting as a conduit for electron transfer and S&#8722;S bond formation.







Abstract
The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is thought to be involved in the post&#8208;translational modification of cysteine residues to produce reactive persulfides. A persulfide&#8208;specific chemoselective proteomics approach with mammalian cells has identified a broad range of zinc finger (ZF) proteins as targets of persulfidation. Parallel studies with isolated ZFs show that persulfidation is mediated by ZnII, O2, and H2S, with intermediates involving oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based radicals detected by mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopies. A small molecule ZnII complex exhibits analogous reactivity with H2S and O2, giving a persulfidated product. These data show that ZnII is not just a biological structural element, but also plays a critical role in mediating H2S&#8208;dependent persulfidation. ZF persulfidation appears to be a general post&#8208;translational modification and a possible conduit for H2S signaling. This work has implications for our understanding of H2S&#8208;mediated signaling and the regulation of ZFs in cellular physiology and development.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Field Induced Synthesis of Ultrafine&#8208;Sized High&#8208;Entropy Compounds with Excellent Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited in the high&#8208;pressure field to achieve the general formation of ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy compounds (HECs). Their unique advantages of ultrafine size, carbon incorporation, and high entropy effect enable them to have excellent reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage reaction kinetics and capacities.







Abstract
Emerging high entropy compounds (HECs) have attracted huge attention in electrochemical energy&#8208;related applications. The features of ultrafine size and carbon incorporation show great potential to boost the ion&#8208;storage kinetics of HECs. However, they are rarely reported because high&#8208;temperature calcination tends to result in larger crystallites, phase separation, and carbon reduction. Herein, using the NaCl self&#8208;assembly template method, by introducing a high&#8208;pressure field in the calcination process, the atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited for the general formation of HECs, and the HEC aggregation is inhibited for obtaining ultrafine size. The general preparation of ultrafine&#8208;sized (&lt;10&#8197;nm) HECs (nitrides, oxides, sulfides, and phosphates) anchored on porous carbon composites is realized. They are demonstrated by combining advanced characterization technologies with theoretical computations. Ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy sulfides&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/porous carbon (HES&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/PC) as representative anodes exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;ion storage kinetics and capacities (a high rating capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for full cell and a high cycling capacity of 281&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles for half cell) due to the combining advantages of high entropy effect, ultrafine size, and PC incorporation. Our work provides a new opportunity for designing and fabricating ultrafine&#8208;sized HECs.

Ultrafine-sized high entropy sulfides-MnFeCoCuSnMo/porous carbon (HES-MnFeCoCuSnMo/PC) as representative anodes exhibit excellent sodium-ion storage kinetics and capacities (a high rating capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for full cell and a high cycling capacity of 281&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 6000 cycles for half cell) due to the combining advantages of high entropy effect, ultrafine size, and PC incorporation. Our work provides a new opportunity for designing and fabricating ultrafine-sized HECs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Including the Ensemble of Unstructured Conformations in the Analysis of Protein's Native State by High&#8208;Pressure NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The separation between general and structural related effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein chemical shifts is an issue which has so far been assessed by the impact hydrostatic pressure has on random coil peptides. Here, a new approach based on the response of the corresponding unfolded polypeptide chain under study to increasing hydrostatic pressure has been developed and is compared with existing approaches.







Abstract
The analysis of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift of proteins allows statements on structural fluctuations proteins exhibit at ambient pressure. The inherent issue of separating general pressure effects from structural related effects on the pressure dependence of chemical shifts has so far been addressed by considering the characteristics of random coil peptides on increasing pressure. In this work, chemically and pressure denatured states of the cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) have been assigned in 2D 1H&#8208;15N HSQC NMR spectra and their dependence on increasing hydrostatic pressure has been evaluated. The pressure denatured polypeptide chain has been used to separate general from structural related effects on 1H and 15N chemical shifts of native BsCspB and the implications on the interpretation of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift regarding the structure of BsCspB are discussed. It has been found that the ensemble of unstructured conformations of BsCspB shows different responses to increasing pressure than random coil peptides do. Thus, the approach used for considering the general effects that arise when hydrostatic pressure increases changes the structural conclusions that are drawn from high pressure NMR spectroscopic experiments that rely on the analysis of chemical shifts.

         <title>A Universal Self&#8208;Propagating Synthesis of Aluminum&#8208;Based Oxyhalide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+).







Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a vital role in high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, the current method of SSE preparation usually involves high&#8208;energy mechanical ball milling and/or a high&#8208;temperature annealing process, which is not suitable for practical application. Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+). It is elucidated that the amorphous matrix, which mainly consists of various oxidized chloroaluminate species that provide numerous sites for smooth ion migration, is actually the key factor for the achieved high conductivities. Benefit from their easy synthesis, low cost, and low weight, the aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs synthesized by our approach could further promote practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Photochromic Silver(I) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Alternative Topology, Dynamic Photoluminescence and Efficient Photothermal Conversion Modulated by Anionic Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>

The photogenerated radicals in silver(I) metal&#8211;organic frameworks with alternative topology devote to achieving wide CIE color space tunability and the switching of admirable NIR photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Photogenerated radicals are an indispensable member of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photochromic material family, as they can effectively modulate the photoluminescence and photothermal conversion performance of radical&#8208;induced photochromic complexes. Herein, two novel radical&#8208;induced photochromic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Ag(TEPE)](AC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7/4H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5/4EtOH (1) and [Ag(TEPE)](NC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;EtOH (2), are reported. Distinctly different topological networks can be obtained by judiciously introducing alternative &#960;&#8208;conjugated anionic guests, including a new topological structure (named as sfm) first reported in this work, describing as 4,4,4,4&#8208;c net. EPR data and UV&#8211;Vis spectra prove the radical&#8208;induced photochromic mechanism. Dynamic photochromism exhibits tunability in a wide CIE color space, with a linear segment from yellow to red for 1, while a curved coordinate line for 2, resulting in colorful emission from blue to orange. Moreover, photogenerated TEPE* radicals effectively activate the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion effect of MOFs. Under 1&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the surface temperatures of photoproducts 1* and 2* can reach ~160&#8201;&#176;C and ~120&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with competitive NIR photothermal conversion efficiencies &#951;=51.8&#8201;% (1*) and 36.2&#8201;% (2*). This work develops a feasible electrostatic compensation strategy to accurately introduce photoactive anionic guests into MOFs to construct multifunctional radical&#8208;induced photothermal conversion materials with tunable photoluminescence behavior.

         <title>Discovery, Structure, and Engineering of a cis&#8208;Geranylfarnesyl Diphosphate Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) was discovered from Streptomyces clavuligerus. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that ScGFPPS catalyzed the condensation of DMAPP, GPP, and FPP with IPP to yield six cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Structural variances between ScGFPPS and NNPS facilitated the strategic bioengineering of ScGFPPS to achieve high product specificity.







Abstract
cis&#8208;Prenyltransferases (cis&#8208;PTs) catalyze the sequential head&#8208;to&#8208;tail condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic diphosphates, producing mixed E&#8211;Z prenyl diphosphates of varying lengths; however, the specific enzymes synthesizing cis&#8208;C25 prenyl diphosphates have not been identified. Herein, we present the discovery and characterization of a cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus. This enzyme demonstrates high catalytic proficiency in generating six distinct cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids, including three C25 and three C20 variants. We determined the crystal structure of ScGFPPS. Additionally, we unveil the crystal structure of nerylneryl diphosphate synthase (NNPS), known for synthesizing an all&#8208;cis&#8208;C20 polyisoprenoid. Comparative structural analysis of ScGFPPS and NNPS has identified key differences that influence product specificity. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we have identified eight single mutations that significantly refine the selectivity of ScGFPPS for cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Our findings not only expand the functional spectrum of cis&#8208;PTs but also provide a structural comparison strategy in cis&#8208;PTs engineering.

In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that ScGFPPS catalyzed the condensation of DMAPP, GPP, and FPP with IPP to yield six &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-polyisoprenoids. Structural variances between ScGFPPS and NNPS facilitated the strategic bioengineering of ScGFPPS to achieve high product specificity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Prenyltransferases (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-PTs) catalyze the sequential head-to-tail condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic diphosphates, producing mixed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; prenyl diphosphates of varying lengths; however, the specific enzymes synthesizing &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; prenyl diphosphates have not been identified. Herein, we present the discovery and characterization of a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces clavuligerus&lt;/i&gt;. This enzyme demonstrates high catalytic proficiency in generating six distinct &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-polyisoprenoids, including three C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; and three C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; variants. We determined the crystal structure of ScGFPPS. Additionally, we unveil the crystal structure of nerylneryl diphosphate synthase (NNPS), known for synthesizing an all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; polyisoprenoid. Comparative structural analysis of ScGFPPS and NNPS has identified key differences that influence product specificity. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified eight single mutations that significantly refine the selectivity of ScGFPPS for &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-polyisoprenoids. Our findings not only expand the functional spectrum of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-PTs but also provide a structural comparison strategy in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-PTs engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cathodic Deposition&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Thin Glass MOF Films for High&#8208;Performance Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional methods that lead to glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, the proposed cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted approach can produce glass MOF films with a thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m. The fabricated thin glass ZIF&#8208;62 film shows a record&#8208;high CO2 permeance without compromising the selectivity in CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separations.







Abstract
Glass metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films can be fabricated from their crystalline counterparts through a melt&#8208;quenching process and are prospective candidates for gas separation because of the elimination of the grain boundaries in crystalline MOF films. However, current techniques are limited to producing glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, which leads to ultralow gas permeances. Here, we report a novel cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted synthesis of glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness as low as ~1&#8197;&#956;m. Electrochemical analyses and deposition experiments suggest that the cathodic deposition can lead to pure crystalline ZIF&#8208;62 films with a controllable thickness of ~2&#8197;&#956;m to ~15&#8197;&#956;m. Accordingly, glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness of ~1&#8197;&#956;m to ~10&#8197;&#956;m can be obtained after a thermal treatment. The fabricated defect&#8208;free glass ZIF&#8208;62 film measuring 2&#8197;&#956;m in thickness shows a remarkable CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 31.4 and 33.4, respectively, with a CO2 permeance which is over 30 times higher than the best&#8208;performing glass ZIF&#8208;62 films in literature.

         <title>Bithiophene&#8208;Functionalized Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Metal Complexes as Single&#8208;Molecule Platforms for Synergistic Photodynamic, Photothermal, and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform for infrared two&#8208;photon excitable synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy has been constructed. The most potent Ru7 enters cells via macropinocytosis and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy and safety in vivo for melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer.







Abstract
A planar conjugated ligand functionalized with bithiophene and its Ru(II), Os(II), and Ir(III) complexes have been constructed as single&#8208;molecule platform for synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy. The complexes have significant two&#8208;photon absorption at 808&#8197;nm and remarkable singlet oxygen and superoxide anion production in aqueous solution and cells when exposed to 808&#8197;nm infrared irradiation. The most potent Ru(II) complex Ru7 enters tumor cells via the rare macropinocytosis, locates in both nuclei and mitochondria, and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly including DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibition and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy in vivo for malignant melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer tumors, with a 100&#8201;% survival rate of mice, low toxicity to normal cells and low residual rate. Such an infrared two&#8208;photon activatable metal complex may contribute to a new generation of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform to address drug resistance in clinical practice and phototherapy for large, deeply located solid tumors.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate over Phosphate&#8208;Modified In: Water Activation and Active Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
(P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can act as anchoring sites to enrich K+(H2O)n close to the In active sites in the double layer and activate K+(H2O)n to generate H+. Besides, (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can also modulate the electronic structure of the In active sites, resulting in enhanced CO2 adsorption. Both of which shall facilitate the electrochemical CO2RR to form formate.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable strategy for producing fuels and chemicals. However, it suffers from sluggish CO2 activation and slow water dissociation. In this work, we construct a (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified In catalyst that exhibits high activity and selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate. A combination of in situ characterizations and kinetic analyses indicate that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; has a strong interaction with K+(H2O)n, which effectively accelerates water dissociation to provide protons. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification leads to a higher valence state of In active site, thus promoting CO2 activation and HCOO* formation, while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified oxide&#8208;derived In catalyst exhibits excellent formate selectivity across a broad potential window with a formate Faradaic efficiency as high as 92.1&#8201;% at a partial current density of ~200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cathodic potential of &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline electrolyte.

         <title>Building Co16&#8208;N3&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;MOF to Expand Design Parameters for MOF Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual small molecules auxiliary strategy was proposed to construct the first high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture, where the N3&#8722; supplies a new modification site to precisely bond strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction for cooperatively boosting photocatalysis.







Abstract
The construction of secondary building units (SBUs) in versatile metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a promising method for developing multi&#8208;functional materials, especially for improving their sensitizing ability. Herein, we developed a dual small molecules auxiliary strategy to construct a high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC with visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing capacity.

The resulting Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC exhibits extremely high performance for oxidative coupling benzylamine (~100&#8201;% yield) via both energy and electron transfer processes, which is much superior to that of Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (31.5&#8201;%) and Carboxyl @Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (37.5&#8201;%). Systematic investigations reveal that the advantages of Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC in dual light&#8208;absorbing channels, robust bonding between Bodipy/Co16 clusters and efficient electron&#8208;hole separation can greatly boost photosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A dual small molecules auxiliary strategy was proposed to construct the first high-nuclear transition-metal-cluster-based UiO-architecture, where the N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; supplies a new modification site to precisely bond strong visible-light-absorbing chromophores via click reaction for cooperatively boosting photocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;The construction of secondary building units (SBUs) in versatile metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a promising method for developing multi-functional materials, especially for improving their sensitizing ability. Herein, we developed a dual small molecules auxiliary strategy to construct a high-nuclear transition-metal-based UiO-architecture &lt;b&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;-MOF-BDC&lt;/b&gt; with visible-light-absorbing capacity.

         <title>Shell Modulation of Hollow Metal Sulfide Nanocomposite for Stable Potassium Storage at Room and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow ZnS@C architecture with a precise shell modulation is reported to be very effective at stabling the high&#8208;capacity electrodes for high&#8208;performance KIBs anode at room and high temperature. An interesting structure&#8208;function correlation was revealed: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the capacity decreases.







Abstract
The large size of K&#8208;ion makes the pursuit of stable high&#8208;capacity anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) a formidable challenge, particularly for high temperature KIBs as the electrode instability becomes more aggravated with temperature climbing. Herein, we demonstrate that a hollow ZnS@C nanocomposite (h&#8208;ZnS@C) with a precise shell modulation can resist electrode disintegration to enable stable high&#8208;capacity potassium storage at room and high temperature. Based on a model electrode, we identify an interesting structure&#8208;function correlation of the h&#8208;ZnS@C: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the rate and capacity decrease, shedding light on the design of high&#8208;performance h&#8208;ZnS@C anodes via engineering the shell thickness. Typically, the h&#8208;ZnS@C anode with a shell thickness of 60&#8197;nm can deliver an impressive comprehensive performance at room temperature; the h&#8208;ZnS@C with shell thickness increasing to 75&#8197;nm can achieve an extraordinary stability (88.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 450 cycles) with a high capacity (450&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a superb rate even at an extreme temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is much superior than those reported anodes. This contribution envisions new perspectives on rational design of functional metal sulfides composite toward high&#8208;performance KIBs with insights into the significant structure&#8208;function correlation.

         <title>Repurposing Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Ene&#8208;Reductases for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Lactones Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual bio&#8208;/photocatalytic system has been developed for achieving previously elusive diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective radical lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single&#8208;electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations giving a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Repurposing enzymes to catalyze non&#8208;natural asymmetric transformations that are difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods is of significant importance. Although radical C&#8722;O bond formation has emerged as a powerful approach for constructing oxygen&#8208;containing compounds, controlling the stereochemistry poses a great challenge. Here we present the development of a dual bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;catalytic system comprising an ene&#8208;reductase and an organic dye for achieving stereoselective lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations (one C&#8722;O bond for hydrolactonizations and lactonization&#8208;alkylations while two C&#8722;O bonds for lactonization&#8208;oxygenations). This dual catalysis gave a new approach to a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter (up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess, up to 12.9&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio). Detailed mechanistic studies, including computational simulations, uncovered the synergistic effect of the enzyme and the externally added organophotoredox catalyst Rh6G.

         <dc:description>
Via an SBU regulating strategy, MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase (COK/MIL&#8208;125) was successfully prepared and employed in photocatalysis. This novel hetero&#8208;phase not only possesses periodic channel structures, but also exhibits the capacity of molecular&#8208;scale adjustment on energy levels.







Abstract
As an effective method to modulate the physicochemical properties of materials, crystal phase engineering, especially hetero&#8208;phase, plays an important role in developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. However, it is still a huge challenge but significant to construct porous hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures with adjustable band structures. As a kind of unique porous crystalline materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) might be the appropriate candidate, but the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase is rarely reported. Herein, we developed a secondary building unit (SBU) regulating strategy to prepare two crystal phases of Ti&#8208;MOFs constructed by titanium and 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene, i.e., COK and MIL&#8208;125. Besides, COK/MIL&#8208;125 hetero&#8208;phase was further constructed. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, COK/MIL&#8208;125 possessed the highest H2 yield compared to COK and MIL&#8208;125, ascribing to the Z&#8208;Scheme homojunction at hetero&#8208;phase interface. Furthermore, by decorating with amino groups (i.e., NH2&#8208;COK/NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), the light absorbing capacity was broadened to visible&#8208;light region, and the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 yield was greatly improved. Briefly, the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase possesses periodic channel structures and molecularly adjustable band structures, which is scarce in traditional organic or inorganic materials. As a proof of concept, our work not only highlights the development of MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures, but also paves a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

Obtaining X&#8208;ray crystal structures of compounds with long flexible chains that are liquids at room temperature is difficult. A new crystallization chaperone is reported that encapsulates such compounds and provides crystallographic images that cannot be obtained otherwise thus far.







Abstract
Crystallizing molecules with long flexible chains is a challenge, making it difficult to perform X&#8208;ray crystallography. Chaperones can assist in the crystallization of compounds that do not crystallize by themselves by producing solvate crystals that contain the analyte in their three&#8208;dimensional lattices. Among the most versatile chaperones for liquid analytes are tetraaryladamantanes (TAAs), but the size of the compounds that can be encapsulated is limited, and attempts to surpass this limit with known TAAs were unsuccessful. Here we report that 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)adamantane (TFM) is a crystallization chaperone for acyclic molecules up to the molecular weight of phytyl acetate (338&#8197;g/mol). Encapsulation of such a large acyclic compound was achieved when the analyte was esterified and when a two&#8208;step temperature protocol was used for crystallization. Exploratory work indicates that a drop to &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C allows for encapsulation of squalene (Mr 411&#8197;g/mol), albeit with positional disorder of the analyte. Our X&#8208;ray crystal structures of solvates with flexible analytes shed light on how crystalline order can be imposed on large acyclic analytes. The new, fluorinated TAA gives access to crystal structures that were inaccessible thus far.

&lt;p&gt;Obtaining X-ray crystal structures of compounds with long flexible chains that are liquids at room temperature is difficult. A new crystallization chaperone is reported that encapsulates such compounds and provides crystallographic images that cannot be obtained otherwise thus far.

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;Induced Cluster Consolidation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Sieving Hexane Isomers</title>

The dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation renders JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP a shrinkage of the 1D channels in the c&#8208;axis direction, allowing complete exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while maintaining high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit dynamic phase&#8208;transition behavior under external stimuli could have great potential in adsorptive separations. Here we report on a zinc&#8208;based microporous MOF (JNU&#8208;80) and its reversible transformation between two crystalline phases: large pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP) and narrow pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP). Specifically, JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP can undergo a dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation under heat treatment, resulting in JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP with a reduced channel that allows exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers. We further demonstrate the fabrication of MOF&#8208;polymer composite (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP&#8208;block) and its application in the purification of di&#8208;branched isomers from liquid&#8208;phase hexane mixtures (98&#8201;% di&#8208;branched) at room temperature, affording the di&#8208;branched hexane isomers with 99.5&#8201;% purity and close to 90&#8201;% recovery rate over ten cycles. This work illustrates an interesting dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation in MOF structure and the ensuing channel shrinkage for sieving di&#8208;branched hexane isomers, which may have important implications for the development of MOFs with dynamic behavior and their potential applications in non&#8208;thermal driven separation technologies.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Cyclized Polyacrylonitrile as an Electron Selective Layer for n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cell with Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
In situ cyclized polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) is developed as an electron selective layer (ESL) for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. The CPAN layer possesses n&#8208;type semiconductor properties with a high electron mobility of 4.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and is insoluble in common solvents. The resultant PSC affords a power conversion efficiency of 23.12&#8201;% with high operational stability.







Abstract
In situ cyclized polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) is developed to replace n&#8208;type metal oxide semiconductors (TiO2 or SnO2) as an electron selective layer (ESL) for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The CPAN layer is fabricated via facile in situ cyclization reaction of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) coated on a conducting glass substrate. The CPAN layer is robust and insoluble in common solvents, and possesses n&#8208;type semiconductor properties with a high electron mobility of 4.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. With the CPAN as an ESL, the PSC affords a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.12&#8201;%, which is the highest for the n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with organic ESLs. Moreover, the device with the CPAN layer holds superior operational stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 500&#8197;h continuous light soaking. These results confirm that the CPAN layer would be a desirable low&#8208;cost and efficient ESL for n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs and other photoelectronic devices with high performance and stability.

         <title>Revealing Na+&#8208;coordination induced Failure Mechanism of Metal Sulfide Anode for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination with Na+ in electrolyte induces excessive dissolution and electric field driven delocalization of Na2S, causing solo oxidations of discharge products, which is revealed as the cycling failure mechanism for MS anode. Therefore, the coordination regulation of Na2S is proposed as an effective strategy.







Abstract
Metal sulfide (MS) is regarded as a promising candidate of the anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) with ideal capacity and low cost, yet still suffers from the inferior cycling stability and voltage degradation. Herein, the coordination relationship between the discharge product Na2S with the Na+ (NaPF6) in the electrolyte, is revealed as the root cause for the cycling failure of MS. Na+&#8208;coordination effect assistants the dissolution of Na2S, further delocalizing Na2S from the reaction interface under the function of electric field, which leads to the solo oxidation of the discharge product element metal without the participation of Na2S. Besides, the higher highest occupied molecular orbital of Na2S suggest the facilitated Na2S solo oxidation to produce sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Based on these, lowering the Na+ concentration of the electrolyte is proposed as a potential improvement strategy to change the coordination environment of Na2S, suppressing the side reactions of the solo&#8208;oxidation of element metal and Na2S. Consequently, the enhanced conversion reaction reversibility and prolonged cycle life are achieved. This work renders in&#8208;depth perception of failure mechanism and inspiration for realizing advanced conversion&#8208;type anode.

         <title>Dual Redox Reaction Sites for Pseudocapacitance Based on Ti and &#8722;P Functional Groups of Ti3C2PBrx MXene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) has been prepared by replacing &#8722;Br in Ti3C2Br2 with gas&#8208;phase P. Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) powder is directly obtained and the atomic content of P reaches the theoretical atomic percentage content. Compared to MXene Ti3C2Br2 with the &#8722;Br functional groups, the areal capacitance of Ti3C2PBrx with &#8722;P functional groups has increased by about 3.6&#8197;times at scan rates of 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate has not decreased after 10000&#8197;cycles. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.







Abstract
MXenes have extensive applications due to their different properties determined by intrinsic structures and various functional groups. Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications. In this work, we prepared new Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) through a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase reaction. The acquisition of &#8722;P is achieved by replacing bromine functional groups (&#8722;Br) of Ti3C2Br2 in the phosphorus vapor. After &#8722;Br is replaced with &#8722;P, Ti3C2PBrx MXene shows an improved areal capacitance (360&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared with Ti3C2Br2 MXene (102&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2). At a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 10000&#8197;cycles, the capacitance retention of Ti3C2PBrx MXene has not decreased. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.

&lt;p&gt;MXenes have extensive applications due to their different properties determined by intrinsic structures and various functional groups. Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications.

         <title>Crown Ether Electrolyte Induced Li2O2 Amorphization for Low Polarization and Long Lifespan Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coronal 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether shows strong affinity towards Li+, which stabilizes not only the intermediate LiO2 but also the resulting product. This transforms the typical crystalline Li2O2 into an amorphous state, thereby significantly reduces the product decomposition barriers. Thus, Li&#8208;O2 batteries shows lower charge overpotential and longer lifespan.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries possess an extremely high theoretical energy density, rendering them a prime candidate for next&#8208;generation secondary batteries. However, they still face multiple problems such as huge charge polarization and poor life, which lay a significant gap between laboratory research and commercial applications. In this work, we adopt 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether (C15) as solvent to regulate the generation of discharge products in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. The coronal structure endows C15 with strong affinity to Li+, firmly stabilizes the intermediate LiO2 and discharge product Li2O2. Thus, the crystalline Li2O2 is amorphized into easily decomposable amorphous products. The lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries assembled with 0.5&#8197;M C15 electrolyte show an increased discharge capacity from 4.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low charge overpotential of 0.88&#8197;V during the whole lifespan at 0.05&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The batteries with 1&#8197;M C15 electrolyte can cycle stably for 140&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the amorphous characteristic of Li2O2 product is preserved when matched with redox mediators such as LiI, with the charge polarization further decreasing to 0.74&#8197;V over a cycle life of 190&#8197;cycles. This provides new possibilities for electrolyte design to promote Li2O2 amorphization and reduce charge overpotential in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

         <title>Biosensor Strip for Rapid On&#8208;site Assessment of Levodopa Pharmacokinetics along with Motor Performance in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to monitor L&#8208;Dopa levels on the spot reliably, rapidly, and inexpensively in outpatient settings, is demonstrated using disposable biosensor strips. The resulting hand&#8208;held calibration&#8208;free L&#8208;Dopameter system offers near real&#8208;time tracking of temporal L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles in Parkinson patients following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration. Such L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles correlate closely with the corresponding motor response trends.







Abstract
While levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the primary treatment for alleviating Parkinson's disease (PD), its efficacy is hindered by challenges such as a short half&#8208;life and inconsistent plasma levels. As PD progresses, the rising need for increased and more frequent L&#8208;Dopa doses coupled with symptom fluctuations and dyskinesias underscores the urgency for improved comprehension of the interplay between L&#8208;Dopa levels and PD motor symptoms. Addressing this critical need, we present a decentralized testing method using a disposable biosensor strip and a universal slope (U&#8208;slope) calibration&#8208;free approach. This enables reliable, rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective decentralized L&#8208;Dopa measurements from capillary blood. A pilot study with PD persons demonstrates the ability to monitor real&#8208;time L&#8208;Dopa pharmacokinetics from fingerstick blood after oral L&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Carbidopa (C&#8211;Dopa) tablet administration. Correlating capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with PD motor scores revealed a well&#8208;defined inverse correlation with temporal motor fluctuations. We compared the resulting dynamic capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with plasma L&#8208;Dopa levels using the traditional but clinically impractical high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography technique. By providing timely feedback on a proper L&#8208;Dopa dosing regimen in a decentralized and rapid fashion, this new biosensing platform will facilitate tailored optimal L&#8208;Dopa dosing, towards improving symptom management and enhancing health&#8208;related quality of life.

         <title>Noncovalent Interaction Guided Precise Photoluminescence Regulation of Gold Nanoclusters in Both Isolate Species and Aggregate States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an atomically precise cluster as a nanoscale luminophore model, we firstly discover the significantly different emission responses between the intra&#8208;cluster and inter&#8208;cluster interactions, and further demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions including intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;luminophore interactions at molecular level precise can realize bright luminophores in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases.







Abstract
Designing luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states is of great importance in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra&#8208;cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au25(pMBA)18 (pMBA=4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter&#8208;cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well&#8208;designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter&#8208;cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au25(pMBA)18 at the molecular level to enhance intra&#8208;cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.

         <title>Insights into the Distinct Behaviors between Bifunctional and Binary Organoborane Catalysts through Terpolymerization of Epoxide, CO2, and Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematically experimental and computational investigation on the catalytic performances of the bifunctional and binary organoborane catalysts are performed to explore the origination of the catalytic differences in terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride, where gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers and tapered diblock terpolymers were afforded respectively.







Abstract
Alkyl borane compounds&#8208;mediated polymerizations have expanded to Lewis pair polymerization, free radical polymerization, ionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, and polyhomologation. The bifunctional organoborane catalysts that contain the Lewis acid and ammonium or phosphonium salt in one molecule have demonstrated superior catalytic performance for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of epoxides and ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 than their two&#8208;component analogues, i.e., the blend of organoborane and ammonium or phosphonium salt. To explore the origin of the differences of the one&#8208;component and two&#8208;component organoborane catalysts, here we conducted a systematic investigation on the catalytic performances of these two kinds of organoborane catalysts via terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride. The resultant terpolymers produced independently by bifunctional and binary organoborane catalyst exhibited distinct microstructures, where a series of gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers with varying polyester content were afforded using the bifunctional catalyst, while tapering diblock terpolymers were obtained using the binary system. The bifunctional catalyst enhances the competitiveness of CO2 insertion than anhydride, which leads to the premature incorporation of CO2 into the polymer chains and ultimately results in the formation of gradient terpolymers. DFT calculations revealed the role of electrostatic interaction and charge distribution caused by intramolecular synergistic effect for bifunctional organoborane catalyst.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst as an Advanced Redox Mediator for Anodic Oxidation of Organic Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe&#8208;SA@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro oxidation as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect.







Abstract
Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single&#8208;electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe&#8208;SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe&#8208;SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bonds. Moreover, Fe&#8208;SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis. We employed it to develop a new electro&#8208;oxidative ring&#8208;opening transformation of cyclopropyl amides. In this new reaction system, Fe&#8208;SA@NC showed good tolerance to drug molecules with complex structures, as well as enabling flow electrochemical syntheses and gram&#8208;scale transformations. This work highlights the great potential of SACs in organic electrosynthesis, thereby opening a new avenue in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>An MBene Modulating the Buried SnO2/Perovskite Interface in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D material MBene is introduced into the buried interface of perovskite solar cells, it can strongly interact with both SnO2 and perovskite layer at the same time, forming a bridge at the buried interface, improving the charge transfer, and regulating the energy level structure, resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 24.32&#8201;% and better stability.







Abstract
The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays an important role in transferring and collecting charges. Interface defects are important factors affecting the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Here, the buried interface between SnO2 and the perovskite layer is bridged by two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MBene, which improves charge transfer. MBene can deposit additional electrons on the surface of SnO2, passivate its surface defects and facilitate the charge collection. Moreover, the dipole moment formed at the interface increases the electron transfer ability in the PSCs. MBene also regulates the growth of perovskite crystals, improves the quality of perovskite films, and reduces its grain boundary defects. As a result, PSCs based on FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 and (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 get the enhanced efficiencies of 22.34&#8201;% and 24.32&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the optimized device exhibits better stability. This work opens up the application of MBene materials in PSCs, reveals a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind using 2D materials as an interface modification layer, and shows opportunities for using MBene as potential material in photoelectric devices.

         <title>Lithium Pre&#8208;Storage Enables High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Stable Lithium&#8208;Enriched Silicon/Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from water&#8208;sensitive pre&#8208;lithiated silicon&#8208;based anodes, a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material is designed by lithium pre&#8208;storage. This is a new prelithiation strategy employing nano&#8208;drilled graphite with surficial lithium functional groups, which allow for the extraction of lithium to form a special unit, exhibiting both high initial Coulombic efficiency and excellent stability in air and water.







Abstract
Application of silicon&#8208;based anodes is significantly challenged by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and poor cyclability. Traditional pre&#8208;lithiation reagents often pose safety concerns due to their unstable chemical nature. Achieving a balance between water&#8208;stability and high ICE in prelithiated silicon is a critical issue. Here, we present a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material with an ultra&#8208;high ICE of &#8805;110&#8201;% through a high&#8208;stable lithium pre&#8208;storage methodology. Lithium pre&#8208;storage prepared a nano&#8208;drilled graphite material with surficial lithium functional groups, which can form chemical bonds with adjacent silicon during high&#8208;temperature sintering. This results in an unexpected O&#8722;Li&#8722;Si interaction, leading to in situ pre&#8208;lithiation of silicon nanoparticles and providing high stability in air and water. Additionally, the lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite materials impart a combination of high ICE, high specific capacity (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and long cycling stability (&gt;400 cycles). This study opens up a promising avenue for highly air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable silicon anode prelithiation methods.

         <title>Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Y&#8208;Stabilized ZrO2 Surfaces: Importance for the Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a systematic IR spectroscopic study on Y&#8208;stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) in the form of both well&#8208;defined single&#8208;crystals (polarization&#8208;resolved IRRAS) and nanoparticles (in situ IR transmission, high&#8208;pressure DRIFTS) with a special focus on the polar YSZ(100) surface and its interactions with CO and D2O. The IR results in conjunction with DFT calculations demonstrate that this surface is characterized by low&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the presence of O vacancies generated by Y3+&#8208;doping, showing superior activity for low&#8208;temperature water dissociation.







Abstract
The surface structure and chemical properties of Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well&#8208;controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization&#8208;resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y&#8208;doped ZrO2 single&#8208;crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D2O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red&#8208;shifted CO band at 2132&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the vicinity of doping&#8208;induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where only associative adsorption was observed. Together with a novel analysis Scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ&#8208;based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.

     alt="Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Y-Stabilized ZrO2 Surfaces: Importance for the Water-Gas Shift Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a systematic IR spectroscopic study on Y-stabilized ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (YSZ) in the form of both well-defined single-crystals (polarization-resolved IRRAS) and nanoparticles (in situ IR transmission, high-pressure DRIFTS) with a special focus on the polar YSZ(100) surface and its interactions with CO and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The IR results in conjunction with DFT calculations demonstrate that this surface is characterized by low-coordinated Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations in the presence of O vacancies generated by Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doping, showing superior activity for low-temperature water dissociation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface structure and chemical properties of Y-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well-controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization-resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y-doped ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red-shifted CO band at 2132&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under-coordinated Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations in the vicinity of doping-induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where only associative adsorption was observed. Together with a novel analysis Scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ-based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrophilic Hydrosilylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes Derived from Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;Electron Pt(II) germyl complexes bearing small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) catalyze the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrosilylation (anti SiH bond addition) of electron&#8208;rich alkenes derived from enamines, thus producing &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. On the contrary, using bulkier NHC ligands promotes the competitive silylative dehydrocoupling process. Mechanistic studies point to unprecedented outer&#8208;sphere Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformations.







Abstract
The low&#8208;electron count, air&#8208;stable, platinum complexes [Pt(ItBu&#8217;)(ItBu)][BArF] (C1) (ItBu=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C2) (ItBuiPr=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;iso&#8208;propylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C3), [Pt(GePh3)(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C4), [Pt(GePh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C5) and [Pt(GeEt)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C6) (ItBuMe=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are efficient catalysts (particularly the germyl derivatives) in both the silylative dehydrocoupling and hydrosilylation of electron rich alkenes derived from enamines. The steric hindrance exerted by the NHC ligand plays an important role in the selectivity of the reaction. Thus, bulky ligands are selective towards the silylative dehydrocoupling process whereas less sterically hindered promote the selective hydrosilylation reaction. The latter is, in addition, regioselective towards the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of both internal and terminal enamines, leading to &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. Moreover, the syn stereochemistry of the amino and silyl groups implies an anti Si&#8722;H bond addition across the double bond. All these facts point to a mechanistic picture that, according to experimental and computational studies, involves a non&#8208;classical hydrosilylation process through an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in which a formal nucleophilic addition of the enamine to the silicon atom of a platinum &#963;&#8208;SiH complex is the key step. This is in sharp contrast with the classical Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism prevalent in platinum chemistry.

         <title>Temporal&#8208;Focusing Multiphoton Excitation Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy Using Spontaneously Blinking Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) provides the improvement in the utilization rate of the photon budget in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) SMLM imaging through single&#8208;wavelength, wide&#8208;field, and axially&#8208;confined two&#8208;photon excitation of spontaneously blinking fluorophores and reveals the 3D distribution of neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits in the brain tissue of a transgenic mouse of Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) based on temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation (TFMPE) and single&#8208;wavelength excitation is used to visualize the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) distribution of spontaneously blinking fluorophore&#8208;labeled subcellular structures in a thick specimen with a nanoscale&#8208;level spatial resolution. To eliminate the photobleaching effect of unlocalized molecules in out&#8208;of&#8208;focus regions for improving the utilization rate of the photon budget in 3D SMLM imaging, SMLM with single&#8208;wavelength TFMPE achieves wide&#8208;field and axially confined two&#8208;photon excitation (TPE) of spontaneously blinking fluorophores. TPE spectral measurement of blinking fluorophores is then conducted through TFMPE imaging at a tunable excitation wavelength, yielding the optimal TPE wavelength for increasing the number of detected photons from a single blinking event during SMLM. Subsequently, the TPE fluorescence of blinking fluorophores is recorded to obtain a two&#8208;dimensional TFMPE&#8208;SMLM image of the microtubules in cancer cells with a localization precision of 18&#177;6 nm and an overall imaging resolution of approximately 51&#8197;nm, which is estimated based on the contribution of Nyquist resolution and localization precision. Combined with astigmatic imaging, the system is capable of 3D TFMPE&#8208;SMLM imaging of brain tissue section of a 5XFAD transgenic mouse with the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, revealing the distribution of neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;beta peptide deposits.

         <title>Facile Generation of Heterotelechelic Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)s Towards Accelerated Exploration of Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)&#8208;Based Nanomedicine</title>

         <dc:description>
Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx) are promising materials for nanomedicine, yet straightforward end&#8208;group diversification strategies are necessary to promote rapid exploration of this structurally diverse polymer class. Van Guyse and Kataoka et&#8197;al. demonstrate the rapid generation of heterotelechelic POx libraries, and their subsequent use in the synthesis of block&#8208;copolymers, liposomes, and a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;based SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 vaccine.







Abstract
Controlling the end&#8208;groups of biocompatible polymers is crucial for enabling polymer&#8208;based therapeutics and nanomedicine. Typically, end&#8208;group diversification is a challenging and time&#8208;consuming endeavor, especially for polymers prepared via ionic polymerization mechanisms with limited functional group tolerance. In this study, we present a facile end&#8208;group diversification approach for poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx), enabling quick and reliable production of heterotelechelic polymers to facilitate POxylation. The approach relies on the careful tuning of reaction parameters to establish differential reactivity of a pentafluorobenzyl initiator fragment and the living oxazolinium chain&#8208;end, allowing the selective introduction of N&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;nucleophiles via the termination of the polymerization, and a consecutive nucleophilic para&#8208;fluoro substitution. The value of this approach for the accelerated development of nanomedicine is demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined lipid&#8208;polymer conjugates and POx&#8208;polypeptide block&#8208;copolymers, which are well&#8208;suited for drug and gene delivery. Furthermore, we investigated the application of a lipid&#8208;POx conjugate for the formulation and delivery of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles for immunization against the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus, underscoring the value of POx as a biocompatible polymer platform.

         <title>A H2O2 Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast Power Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery simultaneously integrates the power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. It can convert the chemical energy of H2O2 to electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. Benefiting from the ultrafast energy conversion rate, the battery exhibits extremely short self&#8208;charging time and realizes the continuous long&#8208;term energy supply.







Abstract
Self&#8208;charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off&#8208;grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self&#8208;charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time&#8208;consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)6 battery, which simultaneously integrates the H2O2 power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H2O2 can generate electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery to 1.7&#8197;V through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging rate and the extremely short self&#8208;charging time within 60&#8197;seconds. Moreover, the rapid H2O2 power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self&#8208;charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H2O2 single&#8208;flow battery of 7.06&#8197;Ah to extend the long&#8208;term energy supply. This work not only provides a route to design self&#8208;charging batteries with fast charging rate and high capacity, but also pushes forward the development of self&#8208;charging power systems for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Photoswitching Reagent for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a unified mechanism for photoswitching in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging by analyzing various photoswitching reagents. We found that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process. Based on this systematic investigation, sodium azide is suggested as a new photoswitching reagent.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized optical microscopy by exceeding the diffraction limit and revealing previously unattainable nanoscale details of cellular structures and molecular dynamics. This super&#8208;resolution imaging capability relies on fluorophore photoswitching, which is crucial for optimizing the imaging conditions and accurately determining the fluorophore positions. To understand the general on and off photoswitching mechanisms of single dye molecules, various photoswitching reagents were evaluated. Systematic measurement of the single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level fluorescence on and off rates (kon and koff) in the presence of various photoswitching reagents and theoretical calculation of the structure of the photoswitching reagent&#8208;fluorophore pair indicated that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, which is related to the power of the illuminating laser and bond dissociation energy of this pair. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the molecular photoswitching mechanism in SMLM imaging and provides a basis for designing improved photoswitching reagents with potential applications extending to materials science and chemistry.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Reactivity&#8208;Controlled Stereoconvergent Synthesis and Immunological Activity of a Unique Pentasaccharide from the Cell Wall Polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7 has been achieved via an acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation strategy. Immunological activity tests indicate that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.







Abstract
Bacterial cell&#8208;surface polysaccharides are involved in various biological processes and have attracted widespread attention as potential targets for developing carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs. However, the accessibility to structurally well&#8208;defined polysaccharide or related active oligosaccharide domains remains challenging. Herein, we describe an efficiently stereocontrolled approach for the first total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit containing four difficult&#8208;to&#8208;construct 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7. The features of our approach include: 1)&#8197;acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled glycosylation to stereoselectively construct two challenging rare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ManA2,3(NAc)2 (&#946;&#8208;2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;2,3&#8208;dideoxymannuronic acid) linkages, 2)&#8197;combination use of 6&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylsilyl (6&#8208;O&#8208;TBDPS)&#8208;mediated steric shielding effect and ether solvent effect to stereoselectively install a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic linkage, 3)&#8197;bulky 4,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene (DTBS)&#8208;directed glycosylation to stereospecifically construct a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;galactosidic linkage, 4)&#8197;stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation to rapidly assemble the target pentasaccharide. Immunological activity tests suggest that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Molecular Motions of a Twin&#8208;Cavity Cage with Slow Configurational but Rapid Conformational Interconversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intricate interconvertible system composed of four chiral species of diphane has been studied. The complex structural changes can be dissected into two pathways: a slow C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configurational interconversion and a rapid P&#8208; to M&#8208;conformational transition. As the latter is much faster than the former, the latter can be further deconvolved into two individual conformational interchanges: (P)&#8208;C3&#8596;(M)&#8208;C3 and (P)&#8208;C1&#8596;(M)&#8208;C1.







Abstract
Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin&#8208;cavity cage that features interconvertible C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;configurations, with each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P&#8208; and M&#8208;conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)&#8208;C3, (M)&#8208;C3, (P)&#8208;C1, (M)&#8208;C1. We showcase an effective approach to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror&#8208;image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for the C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configuration interconversion, while time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of the ensemble of all the structural changes. As kobs

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8596;(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin-cavity cage that features interconvertible &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-configurations, with each configuration exhibiting interchangeable &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. We showcase an effective approach to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time-dependent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror-image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) for the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-configuration interconversion, while time-dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;) of the ensemble of all the structural changes. As &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;
&#8811;

 ${{\rm { \gg }}}$

&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, it allows us to decouple the overall molecular motions into a slow configurational transformation and rapid conformational interconversions, with the latter further dissected into two independent conformational interchanges, namely (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&#8592;&#8594;

 ${ \mathbin{{\stackrel{\textstyle\rightarrow}   { {\smash{\leftarrow}\vphantom{_{\vbox to.5ex{\vss}}}}  }  }} }$


(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&#8592;&#8594;

 ${ \mathbin{{\stackrel{\textstyle\rightarrow}   { {\smash{\leftarrow}\vphantom{_{\vbox to.5ex{\vss}}}}  }  }} }$


(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This work, therefore, sheds light on the comprehensive kinetic study of complex molecular dynamics, offering valuable insights for the rational design of smart dynamic materials for applications of sensing, separation, catalysis, molecular machinery, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Therapy, Photothermal Therapy, Cuproptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed bioorthogonal Cu single atom nanozyme (CuSACO) for specifically tumor&#8208;targeting and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided tumor multifunctional therapy including high&#8208;efficiency multienzyme catalytic activities (catalase (CAT), oxidase (OXD), peroxidase (POD)), photothermal therapy (PTT), cuproptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;based immunotherapy, which effectively curb the growth, metastasis and recurrence of tumors.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with atomically dispersed active sites are potential substitutes for natural enzymes. A systematic study of its multiple functions can in&#8208;depth understand SAzymes's nature, which remains elusive. Here, we develop a novel ultrafast synthesis of sputtered SAzymes by in situ bombarding&#8208;embedding technique. Using this method, sputtered copper (Cu) SAzymes (CuSA) is developed with unreported unique planar Cu&#8208;C3 coordinated configuration. To enhance the tumor&#8208;specific targeting, we employ a bioorthogonal approach to engineer CuSA, denoted as CuSACO. CuSACO not only exhibits minimal off&#8208;target toxicity but also possesses exceptional ultrahigh catalase&#8208;, oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;like multienzyme activities, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm generation for effective tumor destruction. Surprisingly, CuSACO can release Cu ions in the presence of glutathione (GSH) to induce cuproptosis, enhancing the tumor treatment efficacy. Notably, CuSACO&#8242;s remarkable photothermal properties enables precise photothermal therapy (PTT) on tumors. This, combined with nanozyme catalytic activities, cuproptosis and immunotherapy, efficiently inhibiting the growth of orthotopic breast tumors and gliomas, and lung metastasis. Our research highlights the potential of CuSACO as an innovative strategy to utilize multiple mechanism to enhance tumor therapeutic efficacy, broadening the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;like behavior and physiological mechanism of action of SAzymes.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Ni/Ni(OH)2 Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Boosts Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Ampere&#8208;Level Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of Ni core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell is fabricated through one&#8208;step electrodeposition to achieve ampere&#8208;level electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia with high efficiency. Meanwhile, it can be used to electrocatalytically upgrade methanol to formate, which decreases the energy efficiency of ammonia production in a two&#8208;electrode system. This is a favorable advancement for ammonia energy.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia provides a green alternate to the Haber&#8211;Bosch method, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics and a low yield rate. The nitrate reduction follows a tandem reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrite and subsequent nitrite hydrogenation to generate ammonia, and the ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) is limited by the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we design a heterostructure catalyst to remedy the above issues, which consists of Ni nanosphere core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell (Ni/Ni(OH)2). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals Ni and Ni(OH)2 are interconvertible according to the applied potential, facilitating the cascade nitrate reduction synergistically. Consequently, it attains superior electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance with an ammonia FE of 98.50&#8201;% and a current density of 0.934&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.476&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and exhibits an average ammonia yield rate of 84.74&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 during the 102&#8208;hour stability test, which is highly superior to the reported catalysts tested under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations corroborate the synergistic effect of Ni and Ni(OH)2 in the tandem reaction of nitrate reduction. Moreover, the Ni/Ni(OH)2 catalyst also possesses good capability for methanol oxidation and thus is used to establish a system coupling with nitrate reduction.

An ingenious strategy is for the first time proposed to develop solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue HLCT emitters by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings onto the HLCT emitting core. With outstanding characteristics of these emitters, the unprecedented OLED performances with a record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 11.5&#8201;% and high colour purity are achieved, showing competitive superiority for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.







Abstract
High performance solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue emitters with a Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of CIEy&#8804;0.08 are highly desired in ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. Although, deep&#8208;blue materials with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state feature are promising candidates, their rigidity and planar molecular structures limit their application in solution&#8208;processing technique. Herein, four novel deep&#8208;blue solution&#8208;processable HLCT emitters were first proposed by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings as functional units onto the HLCT emitting core. The functional units not only improve solubility, enhance thermal properties and morphological stability of the emitting core, but also promote photoluminescence efficiency, balance charge carrier transport, and inhibit aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect due to the weak electron&#8208;withdrawing property as well as steric hindrance. The corresponding solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 11.5&#8201;% with an emission peak at 456&#8197;nm and excellent colour purity (full width at half maximum=56&#8197;nm and CIEy=0.09). These efficiencies represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance among the solution&#8208;processable blue OLEDs based on the &#8220;hot exciton&#8221; mechanism. This simple strategy opens up a new avenue for designing highly efficient solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Polycationic Open&#8208;Shell Cyclophanes: Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Rich Chiral Macrocycles, and Redox&#8208;Dependent Electronic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;conjugated new chiral macrocycles 1 and 2 have been accessed using the redox&#8208;active main&#8208;group carbazole and &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicene moieties. Chemical and electrochemical oxidations of these electron&#8208;rich Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocycles readily enabled the conversion to chiral polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes with tunable electronic states that are rarely accessible from the all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based analogues.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral nanorings with intriguing electronic structures and chiroptical properties have attracted considerable interests in synthetic chemistry and materials science. We present the design principles to access new chiral macrocycles (1 and 2) that are essentially built on the key components of main&#8208;group electron&#8208;donating carbazolyl moieties or the &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicenes. Both macrocycles show the unique molecular conformations with a (quasi) figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight topology as a result of the conjugation patterns of 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorenyl in 1 and triarylamine&#8208;coupled aza[7]helicene&#8208;based building blocks in 2. This electronic nature of redox&#8208;active, carbazole&#8208;rich backbones enabled these macrocycles to be readily oxidized chemically and electrochemically, leading to the sequential production of a series of positively charged polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes. Their redox&#8208;dependent electronic states of the resulting multispin polyradicals have been characterized by VT&#8208;ESR, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The singlet (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;1.29&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and a nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet ground state (&#916;ES&#8722;T(calcd)=&#8722;0.15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;ES&#8722;T(exp)=0.01&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) were proved for diradical dications 12+2&#8901; and 22+2&#8901;, respectively. Our work provides an experimental proof for the construction of electron&#8208;donating new chiral nanorings, and more importantly for highly charged polyradicals with potential applications in chirospintronics and organic conductors.

Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy with temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation achieves wide&#8208;field and axially confined two&#8208;photon excitation of spontaneously blinking fluorophores, as reported by Fan&#8208;Ching Chien et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404942). This approach reduces the photobleaching of out&#8208;of&#8208;focus molecules to increase the utilization rate of the photon budget for exploring the three&#8208;dimensional morphology of fluorophore&#8208;labeled amyloid&#8208;beta fibril bundles in the brain tissues of a transgenic mouse with Alzheimer's disease.

Like a hand in glove , a glove that fits many different sizes, is how TFM, a new crystallization chaperone for liquid molecules, packs when it crystallizes as a solvate, leading to X&#8208;ray diffraction&#8208;based crystal structures that cannot be obtained otherwise. This and a new temperature jump crystallization protocol is presented in the Research Article (e202402976) by Clemens Richert and colleagues. The cover graphic shows the analytes and the chaperone, together with the crystal lattice of the squalene solvate.

Zirconia , essential for fuel cells and catalysis, but also prevalent in fashion jewelry (cover imgage, center), is studied in a Research Article (e202404775) by Yuemin Wang, Christof W&#246;ll et&#8197;al. The research bridges substantial gaps in pressure and materials by translating insights from single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum (left) to powders at ambient pressures (right). Utilizing polarization&#8208;resolved IR&#8208;spectroscopy (IRRAS) and ambient pressure diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFTS) the study connects highly diverse conditions, providing crucial insights into the mechanisms of the water&#8208;gas shift reaction.

Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy, which is one of the most widely used super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques, relies on the photoswitching of fluorophores. According to the photoswitching mechanism proposed by Doory Kim et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405246), the rate of switch&#8208;off is determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, whereas the rate of switch&#8208;on, which is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, is determined by the bond dissociation energy of the photoswitching reagent&#8211;fluorophore pair.

         <title>Consolidation of the Oxidant&#8208;Free Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis Enabled by the Hemilabile Ligand Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview we survey the novel approaches for oxidant&#8208;free Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis focusing on the hemilabile ligand strategy, where (P^N) MeDalphos hemilabile ligand stands as the most successful example. Moreover, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom couplings and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands and novel (C^N) hemilabile ligands are also reviewed.







Abstract
In this minireview we survey the challenges and strategies in gold redox catalysis. Gold's reluctance to oxidative addition reactions due to its high redox potential limits its applicability. Initial attempts to overcome this problem focused on the use of sacrificial external oxidants in stoichiometric amounts to bring Au(I) compounds to Au(III) reactive species. Recently, innovative approaches focused on employing hemilabile ligands, which are capable of coordinating to Au(I) and stabilizing square&#8208;planar Au(III) intermediates, thus facilitating oxidative addition steps and enabling oxidant&#8208;free catalysis. Notable examples include the use of the (P^N) bidendate MeDalphos ligand to achieve various cross&#8208;coupling reactions via oxidative addition Au(I)/Au(III). Importantly, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, such as oxy&#8208; and aminoarylation of alkenols and alkenamines using organohalides, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent advancements in enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands are also surveyed. Strikingly, versatile bidentate (C^N) hemilabile ligands as competitors of MeDalphos have appeared recently, by designing scaffolds where phosphine groups are substituted by N&#8208;heterocyclic or mesoionic carbenes. Overall, these approaches highlight the evolving landscape of gold redox catalysis and its tremendous potential in a broad scope of transformations.

         <title>Photon Upconversion Cooperates with Downshifting in Chiral Systems: Modulation, Amplification, and Applications of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photon upconversion, cooperating with downshifting in chiral systems, offers a powerful method to modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in several ways: (1) Dual upconverted CPL (UCCPL) from the acceptor and downshifting CPL (DSCPL) from the donor can be simultaneously emitted upon excitation with low&#8208;energy light. (2) In dual&#8208;excitation system, the acceptor can produce both UCCPL and DSCPL, each with distinct dissymmetry factor values, depending on whether it is excited by low energy or high energy.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials are increasingly recognized for their potential applications such as 3D imaging, data storage, and optoelectronic devices. Typically, CPL materials have required high&#8208;energy (HE) photons for excitation to emit low&#8208;energy (LE) circularly polarized light, a process known as downshifting CPL (DSCPL). However, the emergence of upconverted CPL (UCCPL), where the absorption of multi LE photons results in the emission of a single HE photon with circular polarization, has recently attracted considerable attention. This minireview highlights the intricate relationship between upconversion and CPL phenomena. During upconversion, the dissymmetry factor (glum) value can be improved in certain systems. Additionally, the integration of both LE and HE photons in upconversion&#8208;downshifting&#8208;synergistic systems offers avenues for dual&#8208;excitation or dual&#8208;emission CPL functionalities. More in detail, the emerging UCCPL based on various photon upconversion mechanisms and their synergy with DSCPL are introduced. Additionally, several examples that demonstrate the applications of UCCPL are presented to highlight the future opportunities.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Driven Inverse Hydride Shuttle Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient and stereoselective synthesis of alkaloid frameworks. We present a unique Lewis Acid&#8208;driven approach to enable the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.







Abstract
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient synthesis of alkaloid frameworks with exquisite diastereoselectivity. However, a number of limitations hinder this method, primarily the strict requirement for highly electron&#8208;deficient acceptors. Herein, we present a general Lewis acid&#8208;driven approach to address this constraint, and have developed two broad strategies enabling the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were entirely unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of the alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.

         <title>Discovery of a Plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Inhibitor Possessing Isoform Selectivity and In Planta Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent small&#8208;molecule inhibitor of Arabidopsis thaliana 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins has been developed. The inhibitor displayed isoform selectivity through covalent and allosteric inhibitory action. Inhibitor&#8208;driven stomatal closing on Arabidopsis leaves was also investigated. This inhibitor provides new insight into the modulation of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and the application to plant growth regulation.







Abstract
Synthetic modulators of plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3s are promising chemical tools both for understanding the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and controlling plant physiology. Herein, we describe a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The inhibitor was identified from unexpected products in a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) of an in&#8208;house chemical library. Mass spectroscopy, mutant&#8208;based analyses, fluorescence polarization assays, and thermal shift assays revealed that the inhibitor covalently binds to an allosteric site of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with isoform selectivity. Moreover, infiltration of the inhibitor to Arabidopsis leaves suppressed the stomatal aperture. The inhibitor should provide new insight into the design of potent and isoform&#8208;selective 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 modulators.

         <title>Record High Iodate Anion Capture by a Redox&#8208;Active Cationic Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of ion&#8208;exchange and redox sites, a bifunctional cationic polymeric materials tailored for iodate decontamination showcases unprecedented adsorption capacity, extremely rapid adsorption kinetics, and outstanding ion&#8208;selective performances.







Abstract
As a critical radioactive anionic contaminant, traditional adsorbents primarily remove iodate (IO3&#8722;) through ion exchange or hard acid&#8208;hard base interactions, but suffer from limited affinity and capacity. Herein, employing the synergistic effect of ion exchange and redox, we successfully synthesized a redox&#8208;active cationic polymer network (SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6, [C9H10O2N5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl]n) by merging guanidino groups with ion&#8208;exchange capability and phenolic groups with redox ability via a Schiff base reaction. SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 exhibits a groundbreaking adsorption capacity of 896&#8197;mg/g for IO3&#8722;. The inferior adsorption capacities of polymeric networks containing only redox (~0&#8197;mg/g) or ion exchange (232&#8197;mg/g) fragments underscore the synergistic &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; effect of the two mechanisms. Besides, SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 shows excellent uptake selectivity for IO3&#8722; in the presence of high concentrations of SO42&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. Meanwhile, a high distribution coefficient indicates its exemplary deep&#8208;removal performance for low IO3&#8722; concentration. The synergic strategy not only presents a breakthrough solution for the efficient removal of IO3&#8722; but also establishes a promising avenue for the design of advanced adsorbents for diverse applications.

         <title>Genuine carbene versus carbene&#8208;like reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet carbenes which are sometime too elusive for direct detection, have been inferred through in&#8208;situ trapping experiments. Using the first spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), this study questions whether &#8220;carbene&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity is genuine evidence of carbene formation.







Abstract
Singlet carbenes are not always isolable and often even elude direct detection. When they escape observation, their formation can sometimes be evidenced by in situ trapping experiments. However, is carbene&#8208;like reactivity genuine evidence of carbene formation? Herein, using the first example of a spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), we cast doubt on the most common carbene trapping reactions as sufficient proof of carbene formation.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Carbomagnesiation for Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral catalytic system that can facilitate the cleavage of two different unactivated aromatic C&#8722;O bonds in the same molecule with simultaneous chemo&#8208; and enantiocontrol is disclosed through an unusual Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction enables the establishment of a novel catalytic atroposelective ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization process. Synthetic elaborations indicates the application potential of this method.







Abstract
There is a pressing need for methods that can connect enantioenriched organic compounds with readily accessible building blocks via asymmetric functionalization of unreactive chemical bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, the asymmetric chemoselective cleavage of two unactivated C(Ar)&#8722;O bonds in the same molecule is disclosed for the first time through an unusual nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction facilitates the evolution of a novel atroposelective ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization. Utilizing readily available dibenzo bicyclic substrates, diverse valuable axially chiral biaryls are furnished with high efficiencies. Synthetic elaborations showcase the application potential of this method. The features of this method include good atom&#8208;economy, multiple roles of the nucleophile, and a simple catalytic system that enables the precise magnesiation of an &#945;&#8208;C(Ar)&#8722;O bond and arylation of a &#946;&#8208;C(Ar)&#8722;O bond.

         <title>Spontaneous &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Ketones by Gaseous CO2 at the Air&#8208;water Interface of Aqueous Microdroplets</title>

Charged aqueous microdroplets facilitate carboxylation at &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H position of ketones by gaseous CO2 at the air&#8211;water Interface.







Abstract
We present a catalyst&#8208;free route for the reduction of carbon dioxide integrated with the formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond at the air/water interface of negatively charged aqueous microdroplets, at ambient temperature. The reactions proceed through carbanion generation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of a ketone followed by nucleophilic addition to CO2. Online mass spectrometry reveals that the product is an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid. Several factors, such as the concentration of the reagents, pressure of CO2 gas, and distance traveled by the droplets, control the kinetics of the reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest that water in the microdroplets facilitates this unusual chemistry. Furthermore, such a microdroplet strategy has been extended to seven different ketones. This work demonstrates a green pathway for the reduction of CO2 to useful carboxylated organic products.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Catalyzed C1 Copolymerization of Arsonium and Sulfoxonium Ylides toward Unrepresented Structures and Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two novel arsonium ylides is achieved and used in the C1 copolymerization with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide. A third unexpected C1 unit resulting from a double bond rearrangement is confirmed by NMR. In addition, an unexpected red shift in the fluorescence spectrum is observed which is attributed to a phenomenon similar to through&#8208;space conjugation.







Abstract
The first synthesis of well&#8208;defined poly(methylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylpropenenylene) (C1&#8208;co&#8208;C1&#8217;), equivalent to poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene) copolymers was accomplished by C1 copolymerization of novel diphenylpropenyl triphenyl arsonium ylides (Ph2AY) and dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (Me2SY) using B&#8208;thexylborepane as initiator. All polymerization conditions, including feed ratio, temperature, and reaction time, were optimized. A series of photoluminescent poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene)s were synthesized at different feed ratios, opening a new synthetic horizon for poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;disubstitutedbutadiene) copolymers. Notably, a new C1 segment, arising from a double bond rearrangement, was confirmed by NMR, resulting in an unprecedented two&#8208;monomer three&#8208;structure random terpolymer. An unexpected red&#8208;shift phenomenon in the fluorescence spectra was observed with increasing the ratio of Ph2AY in the copolymer. This shift is attributed to the aggregation of diphenylbutadiene segment, similar to through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC), likely induced by a decrease in the crystallinity of copolymers. Furthermore, another disubstituted allylic triphenyl arsonium ylides, (E)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbutenyl triphenyl arsonium ylide (MePhAY) was also synthesized and investigated. These additional compounds expand the knowledge and the potential applications of such copolymerization techniques in advanced materials.

         <title>Controlled Biocatalytic Synthesis of a Metal Nanoparticle&#8208;Enzyme Hybrid: Demonstration for Catalytic H2&#8208;driven NADH Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild conditions, small (&lt;10&#8197;nm), spherical, monodisperse metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be synthesised using an NAD+ reductase enzyme as reductant and stabilizer, forming Au NPs and Au@Pt (core&#8208;shell) NPs. The enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids demonstrated promising activity as a H2&#8208;driven NADH cofactor recycling system, coupled with an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).







Abstract
Here we demonstrate the preparation of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrids of NAD+ reductase with biocatalytically&#8208;synthesised small gold nanoparticles (NPs, &lt;10&#8197;nm) and core&#8208;shell gold&#8208;platinum NPs for tandem catalysis. Despite the variety of methods available for NP synthesis, there remains a need for more sustainable strategies which also give precise control over the shape and size of the metal NPs for applications in catalysis, biomedical devices, and electronics. We demonstrate facile biosynthesis of spherical, highly uniform, gold NPs under mild conditions using an isolated enzyme moiety, an NAD+ reductase, to reduce metal salts while oxidising a nicotinamide&#8208;containing cofactor. By subsequently introducing platinum salts, we show that core&#8208;shell Au@Pt NPs can then be formed. Catalytic function of these enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids was demonstrated for H2&#8208;driven NADH recycling to support enantioselective ketone reduction by an NADH&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.

         <title>Synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled Aryl Trifluoromethyl Sulfones, &#8208;Sulfoxides, and &#8208;Sulfides for Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mild and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides using [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent is described. The application to the radiolabeling of different bioactive compounds using &gt;1&#8197;GBq of 18F&#8208;labeling reagent is demonstrated. This work expands the radiochemical space of [18F]CF3&#8208;containing structural motifs for the use in positron emission tomography.







Abstract
Positron emission tomography (PET) is becoming increasingly important in nuclear medicine and drug discovery. To date, the development of many potential PET tracers is hampered by the lack of suitable synthetic pathways for their preparation. This is particularly true for the highly desired radiolabeling of compounds bearing [18F]CF3&#8208;groups. For instance, S(O)nCF3&#8208;groups (n=0, 1, 2) serve as structural motif in a range of biologically active compounds, but their radiosynthesis remains largely unprecedented (for n=1, 2). Herein, we describe general methods for the radiosynthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides. All three methods are operationally straightforward, start from widely available precursors, i.e., sulfonyl fluorides and thiophenols, and make use of the recently established [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent. Further, the syntheses display good functional group tolerance as demonstrated by the 18F&#8208;labeling of more than 40&#8197;compounds. The applicability of the new method is demonstrated by the radiolabeling of three bioactive molecules, optionally to be used as PET tracers. In a broader context, this work presents a substantial expansion of the chemical space of radiofluorinated structural motifs to be used for the development of new PET tracers.

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Nondirected Late&#8208;Stage C(sp2)&#8722;H Deuteration of Heteroarenes Enabled Through a Multi&#8208;Substrate Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of heteroarenes. Reaction optimization was performed using a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach, which enabled the identification of optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. These conditions allowed us to deuterate various heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The importance of deuterium labelling in a variety of applications, ranging from mechanistic studies to drug&#8208;discovery, has spurred immense interest in the development of new methods for its efficient incorporation in organic, and especially in bioactive molecules. The five&#8208;membered heteroarenes at the center of this work are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules and efficient methods for the deuterium labelling of these compounds are therefore highly desirable. However, the profound differences in chemical properties encountered between different heteroarenes hamper the development of a single set of broadly applicable reaction conditions, often necessitating a separate optimization campaign for a given type of heteroarene. In this study we describe the use of a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach to identify optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. Using this approach, four sets of complementary reaction conditions derived from our dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalysts for nondirected C(sp2)&#8722;H activation were identified, that together enable the deuteration of structurally diverse heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Monodisperse Micron&#8208;Sized Polymer Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method is developed here for the first time on the preparation of monodisperse micron&#8208;sized vesicles from an alternating copolymer. Small nanodisks are formed in solution first, which act as seeds to initiate the subsequent growth into circular nanosheets, curved nanosheets, spherical crowns, and final uniform vesicles.







Abstract
Artificial vesicles are recognized as powerful platforms for a large body of research across the disciplines of chemistry, physics and biology. Despite the great progress, control of the size distribution to make uniform vesicles remains fundamentally difficult due to the highly uncontrollable growth kinetics, especially for micron&#8208;sized vesicles. Here we report a template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method to prepare monodisperse vesicles around 1&#8197;&#956;m from an alternating copolymer. The polymer forms nanodisks (ca. 9&#8197;nm) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), acting as seeds for subsequent growth. By adding water, the nanodisks gradually grow into larger circular bilayer nanosheets, which bend to crowns and continue to grow into uniform micron&#8208;sized vesicles. The first&#8208;order growth kinetics as well as the small size polydispersity index (&lt;0.1) suggests the living self&#8208;assembly characteristics. This work paves a new way in both living self&#8208;assembly and monodisperse polymer vesicles.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Thermally Responsive Crystallization&#8208;Driven Template Autocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we elucidate the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by trans&#8208;amides in thermally responsive crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis. The H&#8208;bonds not only endow the product with template ability but can also thermally activate or inhibit autocatalysis by reversibly changing amide conformations. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.







Abstract
Autocatalysis has been recognized to be involved in the emergence of life and intrinsic to biomolecular replication. Recently, an efficient template autocatalysis driven by solvent&#8208;free crystallization has been reported. Herein, we unveil the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by amides in crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis (CDTA), which involves the autocatalytic activity, template selectivity, and thermal responsiveness. We found that the thermal&#8208;induced cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amides possibly affects the H&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated template ability of products for autocatalytic transformation. As a result, CDTA can be reversibly inhibited and activated by tuning the reaction temperatures. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.

         <title>A MOF@Metal Oxide Heterostructure Induced by Post&#8208;Synthetic Gamma&#8208;Ray Irradiation for Catalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time explore a novel and simple route to construct MOF heterostructures using advanced post&#8208;synthetic radiation technique. Notably, a new HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure was synthesized through a combination of in situ skeleton etching and metal node reduction within parent MOF induced by gamma radiation under ambient conditions. The resulting HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O exhibits remarkable catalytic performance in the reduction of p&#8208;nitrophenol to p&#8208;aminophenol compared to the parent HKUST&#8208;1.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based heterostructures, which exhibit enhanced or unexpected functionality and properties due to synergistic effects, are typically synthesized using post&#8208;synthetic strategies. However, several reported post&#8208;synthetic strategies remain unsatisfactory, considering issues such as damage to the crystallinity of MOFs, presence of impure phases, and high time and energy consumption. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a novel route for constructing MOF based heterostructures using radiation&#8208;induced post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting the merits of convenience, ambient conditions, large&#8208;scale production, and notable time and energy saving. Specifically, a new HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure was successfully synthesized by simply irradiating a methanol solution dispersed of HKUST&#8208;1 with gamma ray under ambient conditions. The copper source of Cu2O was directly derived from in situ radiation etching and reduction of the parent HKUST&#8208;1, without the use of any additional copper reagents. Significantly, the resulting HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, with a catalytic rate constant nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the parent HKUST&#8208;1.

         <title>Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Shows Anomalous Entropic Effect on Catalysis through Surface Pre&#8208;melting of Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics and free energy calculation, it has been revealed that the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts can be modulated by a new surface pre&#8208;melting mechanism, which is further subject to additional tuning by introducing surface point defects.







Abstract
Due to the superior catalytic activity and efficient utilization of noble metals, nanocatalysts are extensively used in the modern industrial production of chemicals. The surface structures of these materials are significantly influenced by reactive adsorbates, leading to dynamic behavior under experimental conditions. The dynamic nature poses significant challenges in studying the structure&#8211;activity relations of catalysts. Herein, we unveil an anomalous entropic effect on catalysis via surface pre&#8208;melting of nanoclusters through machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics and free energy calculation. We find that due to the pre&#8208;melting of shell atoms, there exists a non&#8208;linear variation in the catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with temperature. Consequently, two notable changes in catalyst activity occur at the respective temperatures of melting for the shell and core atoms. We further study the nanoclusters with surface point defects, i.e. vacancy and ad&#8208;atom, and observe significant decrease in the surface melting temperatures of the nanoclusters, enabling the reaction to take place under more favorable and milder conditions. These findings not only provide novel insights into dynamic catalysis of nanoclusters but also offer new understanding of the role of point defects in catalytic processes.

         <title>Potent Immunomodulators Developed from an Unstable Bacterial Metabolite of Vitamin B2 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient bacterial metabolite that potently activates T lymphocytes called MAIT cells is too unstable in water to fully exploit in biology. Here, we describe highly stable and extremely potent new immunostimulants, immunosuppressants, and probes that shed new light on the mechanism of MAIT cell activation. These new chemical tools offer fresh insights for designing novel vaccines, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anti&#8208;infective drugs.







Abstract
Bacterial synthesis of vitamin B2 generates a by&#8208;product, 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;d&#8208;ribityl&#8208;aminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), with potent immunological properties in mammals, but it is rapidly degraded in water. This natural product covalently bonds to the key immunological protein MR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling MR1 refolding and trafficking to the cell surface, where it interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on mucosal associated invariant T lymphocytes (MAIT cells), activating their immunological and antimicrobial properties. Here, we strategically modify this natural product to understand the molecular basis of its recognition by MR1. This culminated in the discovery of new water&#8208;stable compounds with extremely powerful and distinctive immunological functions. We report their capacity to bind MR1 inside APCs, triggering its expression on the cell surface (EC50 17&#8197;nM), and their potent activation (EC50 56&#8197;pM) or inhibition (IC50 80&#8197;nM) of interacting MAIT cells. We further derivatize compounds with diazirine&#8208;alkyne, biotin, or fluorophore (Cy5 or AF647) labels for detecting, monitoring, and studying cellular MR1. Computer modeling casts new light on the molecular mechanism of activation, revealing that potent activators are first captured in a tyrosine&#8208; and serine&#8208;lined cleft in MR1 via specific pi&#8208;interactions and H&#8208;bonds, before more tightly attaching via a covalent bond to Lys43 in MR1. This chemical study advances our molecular understanding of how bacterial metabolites are captured by MR1, influence cell surface expression of MR1, interact with T cells to induce immunity, and offers novel clues for developing new vaccine adjuvants, immunotherapeutics, and anticancer drugs.

         <title>Controlling the Orientation&#8208;Dependent Second Harmonic Generation in Hybrid Germanium Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet engineering is an effective approach to enhance second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the larger polarization from the higher in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density within the (101) MAGeI3, results in the stronger SHG in the (101)&#8208;oriented than the (210)&#8208;oriented methylammonium germanium iodide crystals.







Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation plays a crucial role in the conversion efficiency during second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we provide a new strategy in controlling the surface&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG with the precise design of (101) and (2

0), which indirectly demonstrates the stronger intrinsic polarization on the (101) surface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the band bending within the (101) facet. Temperature&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy show shorter lifetime and wider emission band in the (101) MAGeI3 single crystal, revealing the higher defect states. Additionally, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns show the (101) MAGeI3 possesses larger in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density, which could directly enhance the spontaneous polarization in the (101) facet. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further demonstrates the higher intrinsic polarization in the (101) facet compared with the (2

         <title>Tuning Adsorbate&#8208;Mediated Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction by Oxygen Vacancy: A Case Study in Ru/TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the initial oxygen vacancy concentration of a catalyst supports can regulate the formation of adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) and its stability under reaction conditions. The concept is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation on Ru/TiO2.







Abstract
The adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) offers a reversible means of altering the selectivity of supported metal catalysts, thereby providing a powerful tool for facile modulation of catalytic performance. However, the fundamental understanding of A&#8208;SMSI remains inadequate and methods for tuning A&#8208;SMSI are still in their nascent stages, impeding its stabilization under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the initial concentration of oxygen vacancy in oxide supports plays a key role in tuning the A&#8208;SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and defected titania (TiO2&#8208;x). Based on this new understanding, we demonstrate the in situ formation of A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions, obviating the typically required CO2&#8208;rich pretreatment. The as&#8208;formed A&#8208;SMSI layer exhibits remarkable stability at various temperatures, enabling excellent activity, selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalyzing the reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction. This study deepens the understanding of the A&#8208;SMSI and the ability to stabilize A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions represents a key step for practical catalytic applications.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)-encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin-15 (IL-15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn Mediator in N&#8208;coordinated Mn Single Atoms and Pt Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biomolecule Oxidation and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid catalyst composed of carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms is developed for biomolecule electrooxidation. The direct electron transfer between Pt nanoparticles and Mn single atoms as well as the construction of bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators during reaction result in a significant improvement in detection and discrimination performances towards dopamine and uric acid.







Abstract
The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms (PtNPs/MnNC) is developed. The metal&#8208;metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic&#8208;bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between PtNPs and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from PtNPs to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8722;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, PtNPs/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on PtNPs/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysts for sensitive sensing platforms.

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Life of Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Xiao et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of an ionic liquid (IL) additive in zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries, which serves to optimize Zn solvation and the anode interface, as well as aids in inhibiting polyiodide dissolution. The research findings reveal a capacity decay rate of 0.01&#8201;% per cycle over 18,000 cycles (4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in a full cell. Such promising results suggest a significant advancement in the field, offering high performing Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining significant attention due to their low&#8208;cost, high safety and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their long cycle and durability have been hampered due to the use of aqueous media that, over time, lead to Zn dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution reaction, and polyiodide dissolution. Xiao et&#8197;al. recently reported the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) to an aqueous electrolyte and found that the IL plays a key role in modifying the solvation of Zn2+ ions in the bulk electrolyte and the inner Helmholtz plane,&#160;repelling H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy also indicates a strong interaction between imidazolium cation [EMIM]+ and I3&#8722;, thereby reducing polyiodide shuttling and enhancing the cycle life of the battery. Overall, a capacity decay rate of only 0.01&#8201;% per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, is observed, making the use of IL additives in aqueous electrolytes highly promising candidates for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>Core&#8208;Alkynylated Fluorescent Flippers: Altered Ultrafast Photophysics to Track Thick Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elongated flipper probes with one and two alkynes in the core merge flipper&#8208; and rotor&#8208;like behavior to take photophysical properties to a new level of sophistication and introduce hydrophobic matching with one single leaflet as operational strategy to mechanosensitively track bilayer membranes by their thickness.







Abstract
Fluorescent flippers have been introduced as small&#8208;molecule probes to image membrane tension in living systems. This study describes the design, synthesis, spectroscopic and imaging properties of flippers that are elongated by one and two alkynes inserted between the push and the pull dithienothiophene domains. The resulting mechanophores combine characteristics of flippers, reporting on physical compression in the ground state, and molecular rotors, reporting on torsional motion in the excited state, to take their photophysics to new level of sophistication. Intensity ratios in broadened excitation bands from differently twisted conformers of core&#8208;alkynylated flippers thus report on mechanical compression. Lifetime boosts from ultrafast excited&#8208;state planarization and lifetime drops from competitive intersystem crossing into triplet states report on viscosity. In standard lipid bilayer membranes, core&#8208;alkynylated flippers are too long for one leaflet and tilt or extend into disordered interleaflet space, which preserves rotor&#8208;like torsional disorder and thus weak, blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence. Flipper&#8208;like planarization occurs only in highly ordered membranes of matching leaflet thickness, where they light up and selectively report on these thick membranes with red&#8208;shifted, sharpened excitation maxima, high intensity and long lifetime.

         <dc:description>
This review provides an introduction on the recent progresses made in the field of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for various applications including adsorption/separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and energy storage.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural flexibility, heteroatomic sites, post&#8208;modification ability and high hydrolytic stability have attracted great attention from scientific community. Hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs, as a subclass of Schiff&#8208;base COFs, was firstly reported in 2011 by Yaghi's group and later witnessed prosperous development in various aspects. Their adjustable structures, precise pore channels and plentiful heteroatomic sites of hydrazone&#8208;linked structures possess much potential in diverse applications, for example, adsorption/separation, chemical sensing, catalysis and energy storage, etc. Up to date, the systematic reviews about the reported hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs are still rare. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize their preparation methods, characteristics and related applications, and discuss the opportunity or challenge of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs. We hope this review could provide new insights about hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for exploring more appealing functions or applications.

         <title>A Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Amidination of Lysine Residues That Retains the Protein's Positive Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine and nitrile groups efficiently enable lysine&#8208;selective amidination of peptides and proteins. The amidine products retain a positive charge at the modified sites and allow the charge&#8208;related properties to be preserved, such as the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and the interaction with negatively charged DNA to form protein&#8208;DNA fibres. The amidine products can undergo multi&#8208;site secondary modifications.







Abstract
Lysine&#8208;specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge&#8208;related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge&#8208;related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge&#8208;related protein properties, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine&#8208;containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lysine-specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge-related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge-related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge-related protein properties, such as liquid-liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;-synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine-containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;production of Benzoquinone and H2 Using Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a heterogeneous nano&#8208;electrocatalyst consisting of Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF was synthesized using a partial vulcanization method for composition design. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional electrochemical oxidation performance of phenol (EOP). The self&#8208;assembled alkali&#8208;acid hybrid electrolytic cell can operate continuously for more than 300&#8197;hours at a fixed potential of 0.9&#8197;V. At the same time, through the design and equipment integration of the alkali&#8208;acid electrolytic cell, for the very first time, the anodic oxidation of phenol organic pollutants with the cathodic hydrogen production.







Abstract
In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions. Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99&#8201;%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction (EOP). Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation in an alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60&#8197;V was applied to produce a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90&#8197;V for 12&#8197;days, showing remarkable long&#8208;term stability. The unique configuration of the acid&#8208;base hybrid flow cell electrolyzer provides valuable guidance for the efficient and environmentally friendly electrooxidation of phenol to benzoquinone.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;State Control over Supramolecular Chirality through Dynamic Chemistry Mediated Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;protected fluorinated amino acid was employed as the major building unit to manipulate chirality in multiple&#8208;state switchable states. It flexibly employs constitutional dynamic chemistry including covalent and noncovalent manner to allow five&#8208;state control over supramolecular chirality, shedding light on the rational design of responsive materials as well chiroptical switch.







Abstract
Dynamic chemistry utilizing both covalent and noncovalent bonds provides valid protocols in manipulating properties of self&#8208;assemblies and functions. Here we employ dynamic chemistry to realize multiple&#8208;route control over supramolecular chirality up to five states. N&#8208;protected fluorinated phenylalanine in the carboxylate state self&#8208;assembled into achiral nanoparticles ascribed to the amphiphilicity. Protonation promoted one&#8208;dimensional growth into helices with shrunk hydrophilicity, which in the presence of disulfide pyridine undergo chirality inversion promoted by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;directed coassembly. Further interacting with the water&#8208;soluble reductant cleavages the disulfide bond to initiate the rearrangement of coassemblies with a chirality inversion as well. Finally, by tuning the pH environments, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between reduced products and perfluorinated phenylalanine occurs, giving distinct chiral nanoarchitectures with emerged luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence. We thus realized a particular five&#8208;state control by combining dynamic chemistry at one chiral compound, which greatly enriches the toolbox in fabricating responsive chiroptical materials.

         <title>Unimolecular Chemiexcited Oxygenation of Pathogenic Amyloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid degradation without photoirradiation. Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;X, are chemiexcited through autoxidation, leading to amyloid&#8208;selective oxygenation in the dark. Oxygenated A&#946; furnishes reduced aggregation potency and cytotoxicity. The chemiexcitation strategy may be effective in treating amyloidosis by alleviating pathogenetic amyloids accumulated deep in the brain, where light hardly reaches.







Abstract
Pathogenic protein aggregates, called amyloids, are etiologically relevant to various diseases, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Catalytic photooxygenation of amyloids, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), reduces their toxicity; however, the requirement for light irradiation may limit its utility in large animals, including humans, due to the low tissue permeability of light. Here, we report that Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;Cl and dmCLA&#8208;Br, promoted selective oxygenation of amyloids through chemiexcitation without external light irradiation. Further structural optimization of dmCLA&#8208;Cl led to the identification of a derivative with a polar carboxylate functional group and low cellular toxicity: dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid. dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid promoted oxygenation of A&#946; amyloid and reduced its cellular toxicity without photoirradiation. The chemiexcited oxygenation developed in this study may be an effective approach to neutralizing the toxicity of amyloids, which can accumulate deep inside the body, and treating amyloidosis.

An intriguing bottom&#8208;up molecular engineering approach is revealed toward single&#8208;step synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich laterally&#8208;fused stimuli&#8208;responsive polycyclic heteroarenes, leveraging a highly step&#8208;economic octuple C&#8722;H activation manifold for simultaneous creation of hexagon&#8208;containing planar and heptagon&#8208;containing nonplanar skeletons on readily available triazolium template.







Abstract
Curiosity&#8208;driven innovations on the design and synthesis of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds with new molecular topologies unfold exciting opportunities for harnessing their intriguing supramolecular properties and thereby the development of novel functional organic materials. This work presents such an innovative synthetic concept of a bottom&#8208;up molecular topology engineering through a unique orchestrated octuple C&#8722;H activation reaction, toward the rapid synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;incorporated nitrogen&#8208;doped laterally&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds with rarely reported wavy structural configuration. The profound impact of the molecular wavy structures of these compounds on their properties is manifested by weak and tunable solid&#8208;state intermolecular interactions controlling the electronic properties of the materials, leading to reversibly switchable fluorochromism in the solid state and thin films with mechanical force and solvent vapors as external stimuli, thereby indicating their potential applicability in rewritable fluorescent optical recording media, security papers, mechanosensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors etc.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;breaking of Dibenzo[b,d]thiophene Sulfone Enhancing Polaron Generation for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents BBTT&#8208;1SO, a novel acceptor unit designed by breaking the symmetry of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS). Its asymmetric structure enhances octapole moment and polarizability compared to DBS&#8208;containing counterparts. Transient spectroscopy demonstrates efficient generation of electron polarons in BBTT&#8208;1SO polymers, contributing to their superior hydrogen evolution rate compared to DBS&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
The current bottleneck in the development of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution is the limited availability of high&#8208;performance acceptor units. Over the past nine years, dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS) has been the preferred choice for the acceptor unit. Despite extensive exploration of alternative structures as potential replacements for DBS, a superior substitute remains elusive. In this study, a symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy was employed on DBS to develop a novel acceptor unit, BBTT&#8208;1SO.

PBBTT&#8208;1SO exhibited an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 222.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm.

Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the enhanced water&#8208;PBBTT&#8208;1SO polymer interactions in salt&#8208;containing solutions.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents BBTT-1SO, a novel acceptor unit designed by breaking the symmetry of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS). Its asymmetric structure enhances octapole moment and polarizability compared to DBS-containing counterparts. Transient spectroscopy demonstrates efficient generation of electron polarons in BBTT-1SO polymers, contributing to their superior hydrogen evolution rate compared to DBS-containing polymers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current bottleneck in the development of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution is the limited availability of high-performance acceptor units. Over the past nine years, dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS) has been the preferred choice for the acceptor unit. Despite extensive exploration of alternative structures as potential replacements for DBS, a superior substitute remains elusive. In this study, a symmetry-breaking strategy was employed on DBS to develop a novel acceptor unit, BBTT-1SO. The asymmetric structure of BBTT-1SO proved beneficial for increasing multiple moment and polarizability. BBTT-1SO-containing polymers showed higher efficiencies for hydrogen evolution than their DBS-containing counterparts by up to 166&#8201;%. PBBTT-1SO exhibited an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 222.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an apparent quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm. Transient spectroscopic studies indicated that the BBTT-1SO-based polymers facilitated electron polaron formation, which explains their superior HERs. PBBTT-1SO also showed 14&#8201;% higher HER in natural seawater splitting than that in deionized water splitting. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the enhanced water-PBBTT-1SO polymer interactions in salt-containing solutions. This study presents a pioneering example of a substitute acceptor unit for DBS in the construction of high-performance photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elevated Water Oxidation by Cation Leaching Enabled Tunable Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 with a spinel structure, activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning, demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity among NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 homologue catalysts in alkaline conditions. The activation of the initially inactive spinel is due to surface reconstruction facilitated by Cr leaching, resulting in a core&#8211;shell structure with cation vacancies. This catalyst shows exceptional activity and stability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at 80&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Water electrolysis is one promising and eco&#8208;friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best&#8208;performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500&#8201;% current density promotion at overpotential &#951;=300&#8197;mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni&#8201;:&#8201;Fe ratio rather than considering the contribution of Cr. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large&#8208;scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

         <title>Engineering Ultrathin CuxS Layer on Planar Sb2S3 Photocathode to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a back contact for Sb2S3, an ultrathin CuxS layer has been successfully engineered for the first time to fabricate a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Sb2S3/CuxS hole&#8208;transparent structure. With a substantial work function of 4.90&#8197;eV for CuxS layer, the transparent Sb2S3/CuxS platform enabled flexible integration of intricate catalyst layers at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for efficient photoelectrochemical transformation.







Abstract
Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p&#8208;type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90&#8197;eV, which causes the upward band bending of p&#8208;type Sb2S3, forming a hole&#8208;transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back&#8208;illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches &#8722;5.38&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0&#8197;V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.

Herein, we report that a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled tetrahedral cage 1 with a partitioned cavity shown excellent performance as a multifunctional extractant. The results show that this unique partitioned cavity can efficiently separate halogenated adamantanes, adamantane isomers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Capturing the Interplay Between TADF and RTP through Mechanically Flexible Polymorphic Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphism plays a pivotal role in generating a range of crystalline materials with diverse photophysical and mechanical attributes, all originating from the same molecule. Here, we showcase two distinct polymorphs: green (GY) emissive and orange (OR) emissive crystals of 5'&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TPA&#8208;CHO). These polymorphs display differing optical characteristics, with GY exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and OR showing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Additionally, both polymorphic crystals display mechanical flexibility and optical waveguiding capabilities. Leveraging the AFM&#8208;tip&#8208;based mechanophotonics technique, we position the GY optical waveguide at varying lengths perpendicular to the OR waveguide. This approach facilitates the exploration of the interplay between TADF and RTP phenomena by judiciously controlling the optical path length of crystal waveguides. Essentially, our approach provides a clear pathway for understanding and controlling the photophysical processes in organic molecular crystals, paving the way for advancements in polymorphic crystal&#8208;based photonic circuit technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ln3+ Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Chiral Heterometallic Clusters Ln2Ag28</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of TADF&#8208;active compounds: 0D chiral Ln&#8208;Ag(I) clusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln = Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral Ln&#8208;Ag(I) cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln = Gd) has been synthesized. Atomic&#8208;level structural analysis showed that the chiral Ag(I) cluster units {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D exhibited similar configurations, linked by varying numbers of [Ln(H2O)x]3+ (x = 6 for 0D, x = 3 for 2D) to form the final target compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra and decay lifetimes measurement demonstrated the presence of TADF in L&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln = Eu/Gd) and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag14S12} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;Eu2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;0D. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag14S12} cluster units were induced by 4f perturbation of Ln3+ ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8208;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster&#8208;based luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Free Volume&#8208;Controlled Molecular Clock and Emitter for Multicolored Transient Data Display in Advanced Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The booming demand on data security has aroused great interest for developing smart materials with temporal display feature and dynamic multicolor fluorescence. However, it remains challenging to implement both features on most responsive molecules. Herein, we construct a polymer free volume&#8208;controlled &#8220;molecular clock and emitter&#8221; via covalently embedding a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive molecular switch (i.e., spiropyran) into a polymer network (i.e., poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate)) with programmable crosslink density and free volume. By the aminolysis of penta&#64258;uorophenyl ester with different amount of diamine crosslinkers, pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP networks with controllable crosslink densities are generated, which have different confinement effects on the rate constant of SP/MC isomerization, thus leading to time&#8208;dependent photochromism. In addition, PTF1, a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to polymer rigidity, is introduced to further endow pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP system with phototunable dynamic full&#8208;color emission. Therefore, relying on their synergistical responses to the rigidity of the polymer network, we have successfully developed a versatile molecular clock and emitter via an &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; manner, which shows time&#8208;dependent data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for advanced encryption and anticounterfeiting with a high security level.</dc:description>

         <title>Full Selectivity Control over the Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitroaromatics into Six Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A full selectivity control over the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics leads to the production of six possible products, i.e., nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo or aniline compounds, which has however not been achieved in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Currently, there is no sufficient evidence to support that the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics with the use of heterogeneous metal catalysts would follow the Haber's mechanistic scheme based on electrochemical reduction. We now demonstrate in this work that it is possible to fully control the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics into their all six products using a single catalytic system under various conditions. Employing SnO2&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles facilitated by the surface coordination of ethylenediamine and vanadium species enabled this unprecedented selectivity control. Through systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities, we have constructed a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Crucially, the application of oxygen&#8208;isolated characterization techniques proved indispensable in identifying unstable compounds such as nitroso, hydroxylamine, hydrazo compounds. The insights gained from this research offer invaluable guidance for selectively transforming nitroaromatics into a wide array of functional N&#8208;containing compounds, both advancing fundamental understanding and fostering practical applications in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Macroscopic Dipoles of Designed Cyclic Peptide Ordered Assemblies to Harvest Piezoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline materials exhibiting non&#8208;centrosymmetry and possessing substantial surface dipole moments play a critical role in piezoelectricity. Designing biocompatible self&#8208;assembled materials with these attributes is particularly challenging when compared to inorganic materials and ceramics. In this study, we elucidate the crystal conformations of novel cyclic peptides that exhibit self&#8208;assembly into tubular structures characterized by unidirectional hydrogen bonding and piezoelectric properties. Unlike cyclic peptides derived from alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids, those derived from new &#948;&#8208;amino acids demonstrate the formation of self&#8208;assembled tubes with unidirectional hydrogen bonds. Further, the tightly packed tubular assemblies and higher macrodipole moments result in superior piezoelectric coefficients compared to peptides with lower macrodipole moments. Our findings underscore the potential for designing cyclic peptides with unidirectional hydrogen bonds, thereby paving the way for their application in design of biocompatible piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon superstructure&#8208;supported half&#8208;metallic V2O3 nanospheres for high&#8208;efficiency photorechargeable zinc ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photorechargeable zinc ion batteries (PZIBs), which can directly harvest and store solar energy, are promising technologies for the development of a renewable energy society. However, the incompatibility requirement between narrow band gap and wide coverage has raised severe challenges for high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;functional photocathodes. Herein, half&#8208;metallic vanadium (III) oxide (V2O3) was first reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZIBs. Theoretical and experimental results revealed its unique photoelectrical and zinc ion storage properties for capturing and storing solar energy. To this end, a synergistic protective etching strategy was developed to construct carbon superstructure&#8208;supported V2O3 nanospheres (V2O3@CSs). The half&#8208;metallic characteristics of V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by ultrathin carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework for efficient and stable solar&#8208;energy storage. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photocathode delivered record zinc ion storage properties, including a photo&#8208;assisted discharge capacities of 463 mAh&#8729;g&#8208;1 at 2.0 A&#8729;g&#8208;1 and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000 cycles. Notably, the PZIBs assembled using V2O3@CSs photocathodes could be photorecharged without an external circuit, exhibiting a high photo conversion efficiency (0.354%) and photorecharge voltage (1.0 V). This study offered a promising direction for the direct capture and storage of solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Boundaries: Giant Ultraviolet Birefringence in Dimension&#8208;Reduced Zn&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals have essential applications in optical communication areas. Low&#8208;dimensional structures with inherited structural anisotropy are potential systems for investigating birefringent materials with large birefringence. In this work, the zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(o&#8208;C5H5NO)2ZnCl2] (1) and [o&#8208;C5H6NO]2[ZnCl4] (2) were obtained by introducing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated o&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) into the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2. Remarkably, 1 exhibits a giant birefringence of 0.482@546 nm, which is the largest among Zn&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) compounds and 160 times that of ZnCl2. According to structural and theoretical calculation analyses, the large optical polarizability, high spatial density, ideal distribution of the [(4HP)2ZnCl2]0 cluster, and the low dimension of 1 result in the dramatically increased birefringence compared to ZnCl2. This work will provide a valid route for accelerating the design and synthesis of compounds with excellent birefringence in low&#8208;dimensional systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia through the Cooperation of Plasma and Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Reactors with Confined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process, the high bond energy of N&#8801;N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low&#8208;temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the activated nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe&#8208;based catalyst MIL&#8208;100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) during the plasma&#8208;driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe&#8208;O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL&#8208;100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically&#8208;driven autonomous Janus electromagnets as magnetotactic swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets, spontaneously transform the redox&#8208;induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#181;T, upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on&#8208;board magnetization allows them to perform compass&#8208;like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine&#8208;tune its angular velocity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Tetrahydroindole Skeletons by&#160;Rh&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Homopropargyl Enamides with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We&#160;have developed the&#160;Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of&#160;homopropargyl enamides (tosylamide&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes) with alkynes to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals. This cycloaddition proceeds at room temperature in high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with a broad substrate scope. The preparative scale reaction followed by substituent conversion on the nitrogen atom and the diastereoselective [4+2] cycloaddition with singlet O2&#160;affords hexahydroindole&#8208;diols bearing three stereogenic centers and variable substituents on the nitrogen. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the&#160;ee&#160;values of the cycloadducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, the energy demand is increasing, so non&#8208;renewable resources are being consumed rapidly. Therefore, the need for renewable energy storage devices has become more urgent. SSLMBs eagerly evolve into small sizes, light mass, high energy density, good cycling performance, no memory effect, and environmental friendliness. However, the low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact hinder SSLMBs&#8217; practical application. In this paper, the flexible SPE of in situ polymerized PAAA opens and stabilizes the Li+ &#8242;highway&#8242; inside the SPE, enhancing Li+ transport, and the oxygen vacancies of SiO2 synergize with the substrate to bind the TFSI&#8722;, forming and transporting freer Li+, thus achieving high performance of SSLMBs at room temperature. This study provides ideas for the practical application of SSLMBs.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8722; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.

In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid-state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid-solid interface contact of solid-state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature (RT), and a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport number (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Li+&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; created an excellent environment for TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; immobilization. Free Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while maintaining excellent cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hybrid Orbitrap&#8208;Nanoelectromechanical Systems Approach for the Analysis of Individual, Intact Proteins in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectromechanical systems&#8208;based mass spectrometry (NEMS&#8208;MS) determines the mass of individual particles by monitoring resonance frequency changes in tiny mechanical devices. Incorporating NEMS into an Orbitrap instrument enhances the dynamic range and enables deep proteomic analysis. This work measures E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules, showing good agreement with the known mass.







Abstract
Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)&#8208;based mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging technique that enables determination of the mass of individual adsorbed particles by driving nanomechanical devices at resonance and monitoring the real&#8208;time changes in their resonance frequencies induced by each single molecule adsorption event. We incorporate NEMS into an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and report our progress towards leveraging the single&#8208;molecule capabilities of the NEMS to enhance the dynamic range of conventional MS instrumentation and to offer new capabilities for performing deep proteomic analysis of clinically relevant samples. We use the hybrid instrument to deliver E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules (801&#8197;kDa) to the NEMS devices in their native, intact state. Custom ion optics are used to focus the beam down to 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter with a maximum flux of 25&#8197;molecules/second. The mass spectrum obtained with NEMS&#8208;MS shows good agreement with the known mass of GroEL.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Delivery of Carbon Disulfide in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system has been developed for cell platform applications, and it is found that the hepatoxicity caused by CS2 is related to oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death.







Abstract
Carbon disulfide (CS2) is an environmental contaminant, which is deadly hazardous to the workers under chronic or acute exposure. However, the toxicity mechanisms of CS2 are still unclear due to the scarcity of biocompatible donors, which can release CS2 in cells. Here we developed the first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system based on the &#8220;click&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; reactions between mesoionic 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;5&#8208;thiolates (TATs) and strained cyclooctyne exo&#8208;BCN&#8208;OH. We successfully realized intracellular CS2 release and investigated the causes of CS2&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, including oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death. It is found that CS2 can be copper vehicles bypassing copper transporters after reacting with nucleophiles in cytoplasm, and extra copper supplementation will exacerbate the loss of homeostasis of cells and ultimately cell death. These findings inspired us to explore the anticancer activity of CS2 in combination with copper by introducing a copper chelating group in our CS2 delivery system.

         <title>Boosting the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO by Ligand Engineering of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active electrocatalyst for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion was successfully prepared by the ligand engineering of Au25 nanoclusters with a cation&#8208;relaying ligand. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized nanoclusters was significantly boosted when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of the ligand, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT=1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+&lt;Na+&lt;K+&lt;Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Construction of Nitrogen Stereogenic Center via Formal Desymmetrization of Remote Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted carbene organocatalytic approach to afford a wide range of chiral N(V)&#8208;stereogenic N&#8208;oxide products is disclosed by formal desymmetrization of remote diols.







Abstract
The control of noncarbon stereogenic centers is of profound importance owing to their enormous interest in bioactive compounds and chiral catalyst or ligand design for enantioselective synthesis. Despite various elegant approaches have been achieved for construction of S&#8208;, P&#8208;, Si&#8208; and B&#8208;stereocenters over the past decades, the catalyst&#8208;controlled strategies to govern the formation of N&#8208;stereogenic compounds have garnered less attention. Here, we disclose the first organocatalytic approach for efficient access to a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;stereogenic compounds through a desymmetrization approach. Intriguingly, the pro&#8208;chiral remote diols, which are previously not well addressed with enantiocontrol, are well differentiated by potent chiral carbene&#8208;bound acyl azolium intermediates. Preliminary studies shed insights on the critical importance of the ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) formed between the dimer aggregate of diols to afford the chiral N&#8208;oxide products that feature a tetrahedral nitrogen as the sole stereogenic element with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, the chiral N&#8208;oxide products could offer an attractive strategy for chiral ligand design and discovery of potential antibacterial agrochemicals.

Cu+/Cu2+ dual&#8208;valence state and electron enrichment of Cu sites in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V favorable to *CO adsorption and then C&#8722;C coupling, enabling CO2 photoreduction to ethanol.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been shown to selectively catalyze CO2 photoreduction to C2+ solar fuels. However, they still suffer from poor activity and low selectivity. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance carbon nitride supported Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring defected low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;N2 motif (Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V). Lead many recently reported photocatalysts and its Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4 counterparts, Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol and delivers 69.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 ethanol production rate, 97.8&#8201;% electron&#8208;based ethanol selectivity, and a yield of ~10 times higher than Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4. Revealed by the extensive experimental investigation combined with DFT calculations, the superior photoactivity of Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V stems from its defected Cu&#8208;N2 configuration, in which the Cu sites are electron enriched and enhance electron delocalization. Importantly, Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exist in both Cu+ and Cu2+ valence states, although predominantly as Cu+. The Cu+ sites support the CO2 activation, while the co&#8208;existence of Cu+/Cu2+ sites are highly conducive for strong *CO adsorption and subsequent *CO&#8208;*CO dimerization enabling C&#8722;C coupling. Furthermore, the hollow microstructure of the catalyst also promotes light adsorption and charge separation efficiency. Collectively, these make Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V an effective and high&#8208;performance catalyst for the solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to ethanol. This study also elucidates the C&#8208;C coupling reaction path via *CO&#8208;*CO to *COCOH and rate&#8208;determining step, and reveals the valence state change of partial Cu species from Cu+ to Cu2+ in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V during CO2 photoreduction reaction.

         <title>Coupling CO2 Reduction and Acetyl&#8208;CoA Formation: The Role of a CO Capturing Tunnel in Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase (CODH)/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (ACS) complex couples catalysis at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the generated CO. Hydrophobic sites with affinity for CO within the tunnel act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Our tunnel remodeling suggests that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.







Abstract
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl moiety and CoA to acetyl&#8208;CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. In this study, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.
