         <title>Cation&#8208;Radius&#8208;Controlled Sn&#8722;O Bond Length Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling Sn&#8722;O bond length via A&#8208;site cation radius of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides was a reliable strategy to boost their CO2 electroreduction properties. With Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it was demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.







Abstract
Despite the intriguing potential shown by Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the rational optimization of their CO2RR properties is still lacking. Here we report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples of Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3, as the A&#8208;site cation average radii decrease from 1.61 to 1.44&#8197;&#197;, their Sn&#8722;O bonds are precisely shortened from 2.06 to 2.02&#8197;&#197;. Our CO2RR measurements show that the activity and selectivity of these samples for HCOOH production exhibit volcano&#8208;type trends with the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. Among these samples, the Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3 features the optimal activity (753.6&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (90.9&#8201;%) for HCOOH, better than those of the reported Sn&#8208;based oxides. Such optimized CO2RR properties could be attributed to favorable merits conferred by the precisely controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, e.g., the regulated band center, modulated adsorption/activation of intermediates, and reduced energy barrier for *OCHO formation. This work brings a new avenue for rational design of advanced Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides toward CO2RR.

         <title>Ferric Single&#8208;Site Catalyst Confined in a Zeolite Framework for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site catalyst comprised of ferric iron confined in an MFI&#8208;type zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal method involving rapid mixing at high temperature. The isolated Fe species in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. The catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and resistant to coking.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a highly efficient approach for industrial preparation of propene that is commonly catalyzed by noble Pt or toxic Cr catalysts and suffers from coking. In this work, ferric catalyst confined in a zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal procedure. The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95&#8201;% propene selectivity and over 99&#8201;% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and coke free, with a deactivation constant of 0.01&#8197;h&#8722;1. This study provided guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation over early transition metals.

         <title>Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the light&#8208;independent active repair of a bridged dinuclear RuII&#8208;tpphz&#8208;PtII photocatalyst highly active in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via ammonium persulfate. This enables improved revitalization of the photocatalyst, which &#8211; along with the innovative detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy &#8211; enhances the applicability of this repair mechanism for a wide field of reductive catalysts.







Abstract
Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real&#8208;time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative in situ technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non&#8208;invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light&#8208;driven catalysis enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.







Abstract
Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small&#8208;molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis system of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester (salicylic methyl glycolide), and yields salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters with high molecular weights (Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#272;=1.25). Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation can synergistically activate monomer and initiator. Moreover, these polymers can be recycled to monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.







Abstract
To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#208;&lt;1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Electrolyte Concentration and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Surface toward Actuating Fast Zn2+ Dehydration for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic process of Zn2+ dehydration when migrating into the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coated on a Zn anode is unraveled. General optimization strategies are proposed by fine&#8208;tuning the MOF surface with hydrophilic groups to lower the dehydration energy by &#8776;1&#8197;eV and by reducing the effective coating thickness to only &#8776;16&#8197;nm, paving a way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities.







Abstract
Functional porous coating on zinc electrode is emerging as a powerful ionic sieve to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby improving highly reversible aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, the ultrafast charge rate is limited by the substantial cation transmission strongly associated with dehydration efficiency. Here, we unveil the entire dynamic process of solvated Zn2+ ions&#8217; continuous dehydration from electrolyte across the MOF&#8208;electrolyte interface into channels with the aid of molecular simulations, taking zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The moderate concentration of 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolyte being advantageous over other concentrations possesses the homogeneous water&#8208;mediated ion pairing distribution, resulting in the lowest dehydration energy, which elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying such concentration adopted by numerous experimental studies. Furthermore, we show that modifying linkers on the ZIF&#8208;7 surface with hydrophilic groups such as &#8722;OH or &#8722;NH2 can weaken the solvation shell of Zn2+ ions to lower the dehydration free energy by approximately 1&#8197;eV, and may improve the electrical conductivity of MOF. These results shed light on the ions delivery mechanism and pave way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities through atomic&#8208;scale modification of functional porous materials.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Poor Acridones and Acridiniums as Super Photooxidants in Molecular Photoelectrochemistry by Unusual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under photoelectrochemical conditions, dicyanated acridones are precatalysts for acridinium ions as closed&#8208;shell, highly potent arene photooxidants. Despite the lifetime permitting diffusion&#8208;controlled quenching, a preassembly with substrate nonetheless operates. Highlighting the profound influence of preassembly on photocatalysis, quenching diverts from single to double electron transfer reduction of the excited state to an acridinide anion.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient acridones and in situ generated acridinium salts are reported as potent, closed&#8208;shell photooxidants that undergo surprising mechanisms. When bridging acyclic triarylamine catalysts with a carbonyl group (acridones), this completely diverts their behavior away from open&#8208;shell, radical cationic, &#8216;beyond diffusion&#8217; photocatalysis to closed&#8208;shell, neutral, diffusion&#8208;controlled photocatalysis. Br&#248;nsted acid activation of acridones dramatically increases excited state oxidation power (by +0.8&#8197;V). Upon reduction of protonated acridones, they transform to electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts as even more potent photooxidants (*E1/2=+2.56&#8211;3.05&#8197;V vs SCE). These oxidize even electron&#8208;deficient arenes where conventional acridinium salt photooxidants have thusfar been limited to electron&#8208;rich arenes. Surprisingly, upon photoexcitation these electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts appear to undergo two electron reductive quenching to form acridinide anions, spectroscopically&#8208;detected as their protonated forms. This new behaviour is partly enabled by a catalyst preassembly with the arene, and contrasts to conventional SET reductive quenching of acridinium salts. Critically, this study illustrates how redox active chromophoric molecules initially considered photocatalysts can transform during the reaction to catalytically active species with completely different redox and spectroscopic properties.

A bifunctional concentration electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate) with high ion conductivity is developed to reduce the dissolution of polysulfides and stabilize the K anode for advanced K&#8722;S batteries. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries based on &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; conversion mechanism display superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8722;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Dispersion of Rhodium Clusters into Isolated Single Atoms at Low Temperature and the Consequences for CO Oxidation Activity</title>

Rh clusters undergo partial dispersion upon exposure to oxygen at room temperature. The extent of dispersion increases at higher temperatures and is higher for smaller clusters. The dispersed Rh single atoms show two orders of magnitude higher activity than nanoparticles.







Abstract
Understanding the dynamic structural evolution of supported metal clusters under reaction conditions is crucial to develop structure reactivity relations. Here, we followed the structure of different size Rh clusters supported on Al2O3 using in situ/operando spectroscopy and ex situ aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy. We report a dynamic evolution of rhodium clusters into thermally stable isolated single atoms upon exposure to oxygen and during CO oxidation. Rh clusters partially disperse into single atoms at room temperature and the extent of dispersion increases as the Rh size decreases and as the reaction temperature increases. A strong correlation is found between the extent of dispersion and the CO oxidation kinetics. More importantly, dispersing Rh clusters into single atoms increases the activity at room temperature by more than two orders of magnitude due to the much lower activation energy on single atoms (40 vs. 130&#8197;kJ/mol). This work demonstrates that the structure and reactivity of small Rh clusters are very sensitive to the reaction environment.

         <title>Exploiting the Use of the Decarboxylative S&#8208;Alkylation Reaction to Produce Self&#8208;Blowing, Recyclable Polycarbonate Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;blown polycarbonate foam was prepared by exploiting the use of decarboxylative S&#8208;alkylation to generate CO2 in situ.







Abstract
Polymeric foams are widely used in many industrial applications due to their light weight and superior thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Currently, increasing research efforts is being directed towards the development of greener foam formulations that circumvent the use of isocyanates/blowing agents that are commonly used in the production of foam materials. Here, a straightforward, one&#8208;pot method is presented to prepare self&#8208;blown polycarbonate (PC) foams by exploiting the (decarboxylative) S&#8208;alkylation reaction for in situ generation of the blowing agent (CO2). The concomitant formation of a reactive alcohol intermediate promotes a cascade ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonates to yield a cross&#8208;linked polymer network. It is shown that these hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized polycarbonate&#8208;based foams can be easily recycled into films through thermal compression molding. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that complete hydrolytic degradation of the foams is possible, thus offering the potential for zero&#8208;waste materials. This straightforward and versatile process broadens the scope of isocyanate&#8208;free, self&#8208;foaming materials, opening a new pathway for next&#8208;generation environmentally friendly foams.

         <title>Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External Stimulus&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer between metal sites in a Prussian blue structure serves as a switch to alter the water oxidation catalytic mechanism to an external stimulus&#8208;sensitive spin&#8208;crossover pathway.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic processes involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a kinetic bottleneck due to the existence of linear&#8208;scaling relationships, which bind the energies of the different intermediates in the mechanism limiting optimization. Here, we offer a way to break these scaling relationships and enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue modified electrode in OER by applying external stimuli. Improvements of &#8776;11&#8201;% and &#8776;57&#8201;% were achieved under magnetic field (0.2&#8197;T) and light irradiation (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively, when working at fixed overpotential, &#951;=0.6&#8197;V at pH&#8197;7. The observed enhancements strongly tie in with the intermetallic charge transfer (IMCT) intensity between Fe and Co sites. Density Functional Theory simulations suggest that tuning the IMCT can lead to a change of the OER mechanism to an external stimuli&#8208;sensitive spin crossover&#8208;based pathway, which opens the way for switchable electrocatalytic devices.

         <title>Liposomal Enzyme Nanoreactors Based on Nanoconfinement for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed liposome&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors that enable efficient cascade reactions for catalytic antitumor therapy. These nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting tumor nutrient supply and by producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), marrying liposomes biocompatibility with high efficiency of tandem enzymatic reactions making them promising for antitumor nanomedicines.







Abstract
Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumors and produce cytotoxic species and are therefore promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature where enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposomes. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). Co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of the intermediate product hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H2O2 and acidity accelerate the second&#8208;step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in antitumor therapy.

         <title>Spatially Directed Pyrolysis via Thermally Morphing Surface Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taming fire: Using morphing surfaces to control ignition and mass transport turns combustion to pyrolysis, hence slows rate of thermal degradation. Pyrolysis leads to incomplete combustion, hence graphitic tubes. This being a surface process, nm to &#956;m wide tubes are produced.







Abstract
Combustion is often difficult to spatially direct or tune associated kinetics&#8212;hence a run&#8208;away reaction. Coupling pyrolytic chemical transformation to mass transport and reaction rates (Damk&#246;hler number), however, we spatially directed ignition with concomitant switch from combustion to pyrolysis (low oxidant). A &#8216;surface&#8208;then&#8208;core&#8217; order in ignition, with concomitant change in burning rate,is therefore established. Herein, alkysilanes grafted onto cellulose fibers are pyrolyzed into non&#8208;flammable SiO2 terminating surface ignition propagation, hence stalling flame propagating. Sustaining high temperatures, however, triggers ignition in the bulk of the fibers but under restricted gas flow (oxidant and/or waste) hence significantly low rate of ignition propagation and pyrolysis compared to open flame (Li&#241;&#225;n's equation). This leads to inside&#8208;out thermal degradation and, with felicitous choice of conditions, formation of graphitic tubes. Given the temperature dependence, imbibing fibers with an exothermically oxidizing synthon (MnCl2) or a heat sink (KCl) abets or inhibits pyrolysis leading to tuneable wall thickness. We apply this approach to create magnetic, paramagnetic, or oxide containing carbon fibers. Given the surface sensitivity, we illustrate fabrication of nm&#8208; and &#956;m&#8208;diameter tubes from appropriately sized fibers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimulus color&#8208;tunable afterglow polymeric system incorporating dynamic responsive spiropyran molecular conversion is reported. The amorphous copolymer exhibited obviously abundant and changeable multi&#8208;color afterglow emission from green to orange&#8208;red under different light stimulation and pH based on energy transfer. Lastly, this smart material is successfully employed in programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting field.







Abstract
The stimulus&#8208;responsive room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have endowed wide potential applications. In this work, by introducing naphthalene and spiropyran (SP) into polyacrylamide as the energy donor and acceptor respectively, a new kind of brilliant dynamic color&#8208;tunable amorphous copolymers were prepared with good stability and processibility, and afterglow emissions from green to orange in response to the stimulus of photo or acid, thanks to multi&#8208;responsibility of SP and the energy transfer between naphthalene and SP. In addition to the deeply exploring of the inherent mechanism, these copolymers have been successfully applied in dynamically controllable applications in information protection and delivery.

         <title>Magnetoresistance in Organic Spin Valves Based on Acid&#8208;Exfoliated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid exfoliation strategy was employed to achieve covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films with excellent free&#8208;standing ability, which were then transferred onto La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSVs based on COF materials demonstrated a magnetoresistance signal of &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K, indicating the exceptional spin transport potential of this class of materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a burgeoning class of crystalline porous materials, have made significant progress in their application to optoelectronic devices such as field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, and photodetectors. However, the insoluble features of microcrystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF powders limit development of their thin film devices. Additionally, the exploration of spin transport properties in this category of &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton materials remains vacant thus far. Herein, an imine&#8208;linked 2D Py&#8208;Np COF nanocrystalline powder was synthesized by Schiff base condensation of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde. Then, we prepared a large&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing Py&#8208;Np COF film via a top&#8208;down strategy of chemically assisted acid exfoliation. Moreover, high&#8208;quality COF films acted as active layers were transferred onto ferromagnetic La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs) based on 2D COF materials. This COF&#8208;based OSV device with a configuration of LSMO/Py&#8208;Np COF/Co/Au demonstrated a remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the MR behavior of the COF&#8208;based OSVs exhibited a highly temperature dependence and operational stability. This work highlights the enormous application prospects of 2D COFs in organic spintronics and provides a promising approach for developing electronic and spintronic devices based on acid&#8208;exfoliated COF thin films.

         <title>Improbable Rotaxanes Constructed From Surrogate Malonate Rotaxanes as Encircled Methylene Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surrogate malonate&#8208;based rotaxanes allow the construction of improbable rotaxanes, with the final dumbbell&#8208;shaped component assembled from two different stoppers and the only structure inherited from the malonate rotaxane being a methylene group. The syntheses of improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components demonstrate the practicality and generality of this approach.







Abstract
We have developed a new approach for the synthesis of &#8220;improbable&#8221; rotaxanes by using malonate&#8208;centered rotaxanes as interlocked surrogate precursors. Here, the desired dumbbell&#8208;shaped structure can be assembled from two different, completely separate, portions, with the only residual structure introduced from the malonate surrogate being a methylene group. We have synthesized improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components to demonstrate the potential structural flexibility and scope of the guest species that can be interlocked when using this approach.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Cleavage of Lignin Models by a Soluble Perylene Diimide/Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>

         <dc:description>
A perylene diimide (PDI) S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst selectively cleaves the C&#8722;C bond of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Rigid polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) enhances organic solvent solubility and inhibits agglomeration of the PDI. Synergy between POSS and S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions enables efficient dispersion of POSS&#8208;PDI on a carbon nitride surface for better solar utilization and accelerated charge separation.







Abstract
3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PDI) is one of the best n&#8208;type organic semiconductors and an ideal light&#8208;driven catalyst for lignin depolymerization. However, the charge localization effect and the excessively strong intermolecular aggregation trend in PDI result in rapid electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8722;h+) recombination, which limits photocatalytic performance. Herein, polymeric carbon nitride/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane PDI (p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by the solvent evaporation&#8208;deposition method for C&#8722;C bond selective cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Based on the material characterization results, the synergic role of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction maintains appropriate aggregation domains, achieves better solar light utilization, faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, and greater redox capacity. Notably, the 3&#8201;% p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI heterostructure exhibits a remarkable enhancement in cleavage conversion efficiency, achieving approximately 16.42 and 2.57 times higher conversion rates compared to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane modified PDI (POSS&#8208;PDI) and polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN), respectively.

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;303) are generated. The material gives benchmark one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary mixtures, combining the unique and overall advantages of excellent separation performance, stability, low cost, green and easily scalable bulk synthesis.







Abstract
One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low-cost metal-organic framework (MOF-303) are generated. The material gives benchmark one-step separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from ternary mixtures, combining the unique and overall advantages of excellent separation performance, stability, low cost, green and easily scalable bulk synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-step separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from ternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low-cost, and easily scaled-up aluminum MOF (MOF-303) for efficient one-step C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation. This material exhibits not only record high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes, but also top-tier C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivities at ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro-environment to provide stronger interactions with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst design strategy designated &#8220;catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER)&#8221; enabled the development of a Pd catalyst based on cyclopropane skeleton, which improves the efficiency of catalytic C&#8722;N coupling reaction by up to 3 orders of magnitude, and is expected to be applied to the efficient production of triarylamine optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.

         <title>Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and Propane over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite: Insights into Reaction Mechanism and Product Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite is capable of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to ethylene and propylene, respectively. The process requires lower temperature as compared to methane hydroxylation, which is associated with a different reaction mechanism. Produced olefins form highly stable complexes with copper(I) sites, realizing a product protection strategy and enabling high selectivity.







Abstract
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite (CuMOR) is capable of activation of C&#8722;H bonds in C1&#8208;C3 alkanes, albeit there are remarkable differences between the functionalization of ethane and propane compared to methane. The reaction of ethane and propane with CuMOR results in the formation of ethylene and propylene, while the reaction of methane predominantly yields methanol and dimethyl ether. By combining in situ FTIR and MAS NMR spectroscopies as well as time&#8208;resolved Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the reaction mechanism was derived, which differs significantly for each alkane. The formation of ethylene and propylene proceeds via oxidative dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes with selectivity above 95&#8201;% for ethane and above 85&#8201;% for propane. The formation of stable &#960;&#8208;complexes of olefins with CuI sites, formed upon reduction of CuII&#8208;oxo species, protects olefins from further oxidation and/or oligomerization. This is different from methane, the activation of which proceeds via oxidative hydroxylation leading to the formation of surface methoxy species bonded to the zeolite framework. Our findings constitute one of the major steps in the direct conversion of alkanes to important commodities and open a novel research direction aiming at the selective synthesis of olefins.

         <title>Achieving Molecular Recognition of Structural Analogues in Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: Inducing Charge and Geometry Complementarity to Mimic Molecular Docking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition of structural analogues in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy is achieved by inducing charge and geometry complementarity between 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine probe and chondroitin sulfate (CS) isomers. By &#8220;locking&#8221; each CS in a unique complex geometry via site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions, our platform mimics molecular docking events to enable high spectral specificity and multiplex quantification.







Abstract
Molecular recognition of complex isomeric biomolecules remains challenging in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy due to their small Raman cross&#8208;sections and/or poor surface affinities. To date, the use of molecular probes has achieved excellent molecular sensitivities but still suffers from poor spectral specificity. Here, we induce &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between probe and analyte as a key strategy to achieve high spectral specificity for effective SERS molecular recognition of structural analogues. We employ 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine (MPY) as the probe, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharides with isomeric sulfation patterns as our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Our experimental and in silico studies reveal that &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between MPY's binding pocket and the CS sulfation patterns drives the formation of site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions at the respective CS isomerism sites, which &#8220;locks&#8221; each CS in its analogue&#8208;specific complex geometry, akin to molecular docking events. Leveraging the resultant spectral fingerprints, we achieve &gt; 97&#8201;% classification accuracy for 4 CSs and 5 potential structural interferences, as well as attain multiplex CS quantification with &lt; 3&#8201;% prediction error. These insights could enable practical SERS differentiation of biologically important isomers to meet the burgeoning demand for fast&#8208;responding applications across various fields such as biodiagnostics, food and environmental surveillance.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difluoro&#8208;bicycloheptatriene has been trapped in cryogenic matrices and full spectroscopic characterization is reported. This is in stark contrast to the parent bicycloheptatriene, which remains elusive to this day. A heavy&#8208;atom tunneling rearrangement of the difluoro derivative to cycloheptatetraene is observed and calculations suggest that the lifetime of the parent bicycloheptatriene is too short to be detected in cryogenic matrices.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom tunneling limits the lifetime and observability of bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene, a key intermediate in the rearrangement of phenylcarbene. Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene had been proposed as the primary intermediate of the rearrangement of phenylcarbene, but despite many efforts evaded its characterization even in cryogenic matrices. By introducing fluorine substituents into the ortho&#8208;positions of the phenyl ring of phenylcarbene, the highly strained cyclopropene 1,5&#8208;difluorobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene becomes stable enough to be characterized in argon matrices. However, even at 3&#8197;K this cyclopropene is only metastable and rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to the corresponding cycloheptatetraene. Calculations suggest that fluorination is necessary to slow down the tunneling rearrangement of the bicycloheptatriene. The parent bicycloheptatriene rapidly rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling and therefore cannot be detected under matrix isolation conditions.

A heavy-atom tunneling rearrangement of the difluoro derivative to cycloheptatetraene is observed and calculations suggest that the lifetime of the parent bicycloheptatriene is too short to be detected in cryogenic matrices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy-atom tunneling limits the lifetime and observability of bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta-2,4,6-triene, a key intermediate in the rearrangement of phenylcarbene. Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta-2,4,6-triene had been proposed as the primary intermediate of the rearrangement of phenylcarbene, but despite many efforts evaded its characterization even in cryogenic matrices. By introducing fluorine substituents into the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-positions of the phenyl ring of phenylcarbene, the highly strained cyclopropene 1,5-difluorobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta-2,4,6-triene becomes stable enough to be characterized in argon matrices. However, even at 3&#8197;K this cyclopropene is only metastable and rearranges via heavy-atom tunneling to the corresponding cycloheptatetraene. Calculations suggest that fluorination is necessary to slow down the tunneling rearrangement of the bicycloheptatriene. The parent bicycloheptatriene rapidly rearranges via heavy-atom tunneling and therefore cannot be detected under matrix isolation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid, Selective Extraction of Silver from Complex Water Matrices with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/Oligomer Composite Constructed via Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable ScCO2&#8208;assisted method was developed as a new strategy to construct metal&#8211;organic framework/oligomer composites. One such composite, denoted as MIL&#8208;127/PoPD, was subsequently used for the extraction of silver ions from several highly complex matrices.







Abstract
Every year vast quantities of silver are lost in various waste streams; this, combined with its limited, diminishing supply and rising demand, makes silver recovery of increasing importance. Thus, herein, we report a controllable, green process to produce a host of highly porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/oligomer composites using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) as a medium. One resulting composite, referred to as MIL&#8208;127/Poly&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine (PoPD), has an excellent Ag+ adsorption capacity, removal efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and provides rapid Ag+ extraction in as little as 5&#8197;min from complex liquid matrices. Notably, the composite can also reduce sliver concentrations below the levels (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Using theoretical simulations, we find that there are spatially ordered polymeric units inside the MOF that promote the complexation of Ag+ over other common competing ions. Moreover, the oligomer is able to reduce silver to its metallic state, also providing antibacterial properties.

         <title>Varying the Stiffness and Diffusivity of Rod&#8208;Shaped Microgels Independently through Their Molecular Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, it is not yet fully understood how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of microgels and how this affects specific biomedical applications. We reveal how the architecture and molar mass of PEG precursor molecules affect fundamental properties of bulk PEG hydrogels and microgels, such as chemical crosslinking, stiffness and diffusion, as well as cell interaction.







Abstract
Microgels are water&#8208;swollen, crosslinked polymers that are widely used as colloidal building blocks in scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Microgels can be controlled in their stiffness, degree of swelling, and mesh size depending on their polymer architecture, crosslink density, and fabrication method&#8212;all of which influence their function and interaction with the environment. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of soft microgels and how this morphology affects specific biomedical applications. In this report, we systematically vary the architecture and molar mass of polyethylene glycol&#8208;acrylate (PEG&#8208;Ac) precursors, as well as their concentration and combination, to gain insight in the different parameters that affect the internal structure of rod&#8208;shaped microgels. We characterize the mechanical properties and diffusivity, as well as the conversion of acrylate groups during photopolymerization, in both bulk hydrogels and microgels produced from the PEG&#8208;Ac precursors. Furthermore, we investigate cell&#8208;microgel interaction, and we observe improved cell spreading on microgels with more accessible RGD peptide and with a stiffness in a range of 20&#8197;kPa to 50&#8197;kPa lead to better cell growth.

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidly Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is of great significance. Herein, we developed a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) on living cell membranes for rapid and sensitive cancer cells identification. The FINDER can rapidly identify target cancer cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieve over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells in clinical blood samples.







Abstract
The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the naturally confined enzymes on fluid cell membranes, a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamer&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system capable of accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER rapidly identified target cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieved over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Minimalist Design of Wireframe DNA Nanotubes: Tunable Geometry, Size, Chirality, and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist design of robust DNA nanotubes from only 4 DNA strands, with tunable geometry, chirality, length, and assembly dynamics is reported. The method leads to robust nanotubes under physiologically relevant conditions, as cost&#8208;efficient nanomaterial templates or drug&#8208;delivery vehicles.







Abstract
DNA nanotubes (NTs) have attracted extensive interest as artificial cytoskeletons for biomedical, synthetic biology, and materials applications. Here, we report the modular design and assembly of a minimalist yet robust DNA wireframe nanotube with tunable cross&#8208;sectional geometry, cavity size, chirality, and length, while using only four DNA strands. We introduce an h&#8208;motif structure incorporating double&#8208;crossover (DX) tile&#8208;like DNA edges to achieve structural rigidity and provide efficient self&#8208;assembly of h&#8208;motif&#8208;based DNA nanotube (H&#8208;NT) units, thus producing programmable, micrometer&#8208;long nanotubes. We demonstrate control of the H&#8208;NT nanotube length via short DNA modulators. Finally, we use an enzyme, RNase H, to take these structures out of equilibrium and trigger nanotube assembly at a physiologically relevant temperature, underlining future cellular applications. The minimalist H&#8208;NTs can assemble at near&#8208;physiological salt conditions and will serve as an easily synthesized, DNA&#8208;economical modular template for biosensors, plasmonics, or other functional materials and as cost&#8208;efficient drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for biomedical applications.

         <title>Eutectic&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte with the Enhanced Lithium Salt Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of eutectic&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte is elaborately designed and prepared. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm that the electrophilic succinonitrile (SN) interacts with poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA), which effectively promotes the dissociation of lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB), thus resulting in excellent comprehensive electrochemical performances.







Abstract
The deployment of lithium metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries with polymer electrolytes has been recognized as a promising approach to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technologies. However, the practical application of the polymer electrolytes is currently constrained by various challenges, including low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrochemical window, and poor interface stability. To address these issues, a novel eutectic&#8208;based polymer electrolyte consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) is developed. The research results demonstrate that the interactions between SN and PEGMEA promote the dissociation of the lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) salt and increase the concentration of free Li+. The well&#8208;designed eutectic&#8208;based PAN1.2&#8208;SPE (PEGMEA: SN=1: 1.2 mass ratio) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.30&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and superior interface stability with Li anode. The Li/Li symmetric cell based on PAN1.2&#8208;SPE enables long&#8208;term plating/stripping at 0.3 and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li/LiFePO4 cell achieves superior long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 1500 cycles). Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 pouch cells employing PAN1.2&#8208;SPE demonstrate excellent cycling and safety characteristics. This study presents a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes and promotes the practical application of high&#8208;stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>A Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Enhancing Curcumin&#8208;Based Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

An ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to enhance the efficacy of curcumin for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The strategy employs hollow mesoporous copper silicate nanoparticles to load Zn&#8208;curcumin, which can not only form a Cu&#8722;Cur complex with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect in arthritic area for anti&#8208;inflammation, but also promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts for bone tissue repair.







Abstract
Curcumin (Cur) has been clinically used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment by the means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and immune microenvironment regulation. However, this compound has a poor water solubility and moderate antioxidative activity, favoring no further broadened application. Metal complexes of curcumin such as zinc&#8208;curcumin (Zn&#8722;Cur) features enhanced water solubilities, while copper&#8208;curcumin (Cu&#8722;Cur) shows a higher antioxidant activity but lower solubility than Zn&#8722;Cur. Based on their inherent biological properties, this work proposes a nanomedicine&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange strategy to enhance the efficacy of Cur for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Copper silicate nanoparticles with hollow mesoporous structure were prepared to load water&#8208;soluble Zn&#8722;Cur for constructing a composite nanomedicine, which can degrade in acidic microenvironment of arthritic region, releasing Cu2+ and Zn&#8722;Cur. Cu2+ then substitute for Zn2+ in Zn&#8722;Cur to form Cu&#8722;Cur with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect, capable of efficiently scavenging ROS in M1 macrophages, promoting their transition to an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion&#8208;exchange strategy.

         <title>Work&#8208;Function&#8208;Induced Interfacial Electron/Ion Transport in Carbon Hosts toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon fiber host with high work function was designed to promote electron transfer and surface Li+ diffusion, thus leading to uniform dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition on the fiber scaffold. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibited high reversibility and long&#8208;term cycling stability (EVac: vacuum level; Ef : Fermi level; EVBM: maximum valence&#8208;band energy level; ECBM: minimum conduction&#8208;band energy level).







Abstract
Coupled electron/ion transport is a decisive feature of Li plating/stripping, wherein the compatibility of electron/ion transport rates determines the morphology of deposited Li. Local Li+ hotspots form due to inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer and lead to uncontrolled Li deposition, which decreases the Li utilization rate and safety of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a method to obtain dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes by driving electron pumping and accumulating and boosting Li ion diffusion by tuning the work function of a carbon host using cobalt&#8208;containing catalysts. The results reveal that increasing the work function provides an electron deviation from C to Co, and electron&#8208;rich Co shows favorable binding to Li+. The Co catalysts boost Li+ diffusion on the carbon fiber scaffolds without local aggregation by reducing the Li+ migration barrier. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0&#8201;%, a cycle life of over 2000&#8197;h, a Li utilization rate of 50&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 83.4&#8201;% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.

         <title>Interphasial Pre&#8208;lithiation and Reinforcement of Micro&#8208;Si Anode through Fluorine&#8208;free Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;functional fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte was specifically designed for the micro&#8208;Si anodes. Benefiting from pre&#8208;lithiation of the native SiOx, limited accumulation of LiF&#8208;free interphase with high modulus and fast interphasial kinetics, the optimized micro&#8208;Si anode (&gt;5 mAh/cm2) exhibits exceptional performance, which can be comparable to the best one reported for a particular fluorinated electrolyte.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;sized silicon (mSi) anodes offer advantages in cost and tap density over nanosized counterparts. However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)&#8208;free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre&#8208;lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F&#8208;free electrolyte brings unprecedented F&#8208;free interphase that also enables the high&#8208;performance mSi electrode (80&#8197;wt&#8201;% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900&#8197;mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7&#8201;% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C. This work confirms the feasibility of F&#8208;free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost&#8208;advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.

Spleen Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) transfected splenic T cells after intravenous administration without active targeting ligands to generate in situ Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells. In situ generated CAR T cells increased survival and reduced tumor liver metastasis by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model.







Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy is revolutionizing treatment for patients suffering from B&#8208;cell lymphoma (BL). However, the current method of CAR T cell production is complicated and expensive, requiring collection of patient blood to enrich the T cell population, ex vivo engineering/activation, and quality assessment before the patient can receive the treatment. Herein we leverage Spleen Selective ORgan Targeted (SORT) Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) to produce CAR T cells in situ and bypass the extensive and laborious process currently used. Optimized Spleen SORT LNPs containing 10&#8201;% 18&#8201;:&#8201;1 PA transfected CD3+, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells in wild&#8208;type mice. Spleen SORT LNPs delivered Cre recombinase mRNA and CAR encoding mRNA to T cells in reporter mice and in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model (respectively) after intravenous injection without the need for active targeting ligands. Moreover, in situ CAR T cells increased the overall survival of mice with a less aggressive form of B cell lymphoma. In addition, in situ transfected CAR T cells reduced tumor metastasis to the liver by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Overall, these results offer a promising alternative method for CAR T cell production with pre&#8208;clinical potential to treat hematological malignancies.

         <title>Wetting vs Droplet Aggregation: A Broadband Rotational Spectroscopic Study of 3&#8208;Methylcatechol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Clusters</title>

How does microsolvation occur in 3&#8208;methylcatechol? Wetting or droplet aggregation? Using a combination of rotational spectroscopic and computational techniques, we discover an unexpected hydration pathway by following the solvation process one water molecule at a time.







Abstract
Two competing solvation pathways of 3&#8208;methylcatechol (MC), an atmospherically relevant aromatic molecule, with up to five water molecules were explored in detail by using a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Theoretically, two different pathways of solvation emerge: the commonly observed droplet pathway which involves preferential binding among the water molecules while the solute serves as an anchor point for the formation of a water cluster, and an unexpected wetting pathway which involves interactions between the water molecules and the aromatic face of MC, i.e., a wetting of the &#960;&#8208;surface. Conclusive identification of the MC hydrate structures, and therefore the wetting pathway, was facilitated by rotational spectra of the parent MC hydrates and several H218O and 13C isotopologues which exhibit splittings associated with methyl internal rotation and/or water tunneling motions. Theoretical modelling and analyses offer insights into the tunneling and conversion barriers associated with the observed hydrate conformers and the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interactions involved in choosing the unusual wetting pathway.

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

S atoms adsorbed on metallic Cu surfaces can significantly inhibit CO2 reduction to CO while promoting formate formation in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported as capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We show that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural elucidation of active sites in amorphous host materials is demonstrated by combining cutting&#8208;edge NMR techniques with pair distribution function analysis and computational chemistry. The detailed structure of the heterogenized organometallic complex and its confinement within two amorphous porous organic polymers is revealed by computation and confirmed by dedicated NMR techniques.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR, and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small, but significant, differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.

         <title>Sabatier Relations in Electrocatalysts Based on High&#8208;entropy Alloys with Wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band Centers for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is enabled by a high&#8208;entropy strategy to achieve wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers. The typical volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity as demonstrated by the Sabatier principle has been observed. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle for designing LOB catalysts and provides insights into adjusting d&#8208;band centers in wide range.







Abstract
Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li&#8208;ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas&#8208;solid reaction between O2 and Li2O2. Despite many catalysts are developed for accelerating the conversion process, the lack of design guidance for achieving high performance makes catalysts exploring aleatory. The Sabatier principle is an acknowledged theory connecting the scaling relationship with heterogeneous catalytic activity, providing a tradeoff strategy for the topmost performance. Herein, a series of catalysts with wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers (i.e., wide range of adsorption strength) are elaborately constructed via high&#8208;entropy strategy, enabling an in&#8208;depth study of the Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for LOBs. A volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity emerges. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a moderate d&#8208;band center with appropriate adsorption strength propels the catalysts up to the top. As a demonstration of concept, the LOB using FeCoNiMnPtIr as catalyst provides an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of over 80&#8201;%, and works steadily for 2000&#8197;h with a high fixed specific capacity of 4000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle as a guidance for designing advanced heterogeneous catalysts assembled in LOBs.

Herein, a series of catalysts with wide-distributed d-band centers (i.e., wide range of adsorption strength) are elaborately constructed via high-entropy strategy, enabling an in-depth study of the Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for LOBs. A volcano-type correlation of d-band center and catalytic activity emerges. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a moderate d-band center with appropriate adsorption strength propels the catalysts up to the top. As a demonstration of concept, the LOB using FeCoNiMnPtIr as catalyst provides an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of over 80&#8201;%, and works steadily for 2000&#8197;h with a high fixed specific capacity of 4000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle as a guidance for designing advanced heterogeneous catalysts assembled in LOBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(Alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system has been developed for efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores with high site selectivity. The excellent functional group compatibility, scalability, use of readily available starting materials, and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization underscore the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research.







Abstract
Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapid synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.

         <title>Schiff Base Reaction in a Living Cell: In Situ Synthesis of a Hollow Covalent Organic Polymer To Regulate Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schiff base reaction has been artificially conducted in living cells and enabled the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) that inhibited the polymerization of actin filaments and consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The proposed intracellular synthesis approach may provide an efficient strategy to regulate cellular behavior and biological functions.







Abstract
Artificially performing chemical reactions in living biosystems to attain various physiological aims remains an intriguing but very challenging task. In this study, the Schiff base reaction was conducted in cells using Sc(OTf)3 as a catalyst, enabling the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) without external stimuli. The reversible Schiff base reaction mediated intracellular Oswald ripening endows the HCOP with a spherical, hollow porous structure and a large specific surface area. The intracellularly generated HCOP reduced cellular motility by restraining actin polymerization, which consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The presented intracellular synthesis system inspired by the Schiff base reaction has strong potential to regulate cell fate and biological functions, opening up a new strategic possibility for intervening in cellular behavior.

         <title>Lithium Bis(oxalate)borate Additive for Self&#8208;repairing Zincophilic Solid Electrolyte Interphases towards Ultrahigh&#8208;rate and Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the environment&#8208;patrolling behavior of biological dendrite cells for pathogen inactivation, a dynamic patrolling system targeted to cycling&#8208;induced defects of solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes. Owing to the self&#8208;repairing feature of zincophilic SEI empowered by lithium bis(oxalate)borate additive, Zn anode presents an impressive lifespan up to 1800&#8197;h at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, attaining a fabulous cumulative capacity of 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in Zn anode stabilization but its long&#8208;term effectiveness at high rates is still challenged. Herein, to achieve superior long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate Zn anode, an exquisite electrolyte additive, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), is proposed to in situ derive a highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI and to dynamically patrol its cycling&#8208;initiated defects. Profiting from the as&#8208;constructed real&#8208;time, automatic SEI repairing mechanism, the Zn anode can be cycled with distinct reversibility over 1800&#8197;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, presenting a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity up to 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO2 and Zn||NaV3O8 full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500&#8197;cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy sources.

An azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks is developed for achieving the enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in alcohol&#8208;containing solutions without any sacrificial agent.







Abstract
We report an azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol&#8208;containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent. The best performing cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF hybrid catalyzes hydrogen production with an average HER rate up to 38&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 in ethanol/phosphate buffer solution under 4&#8197;h illumination. Ultrafast transient optical spectroscopy characterizations and charge carrier analysis reveal that the alcohol contents functioning as hole scavengers could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes of COFs to form aldehydes and protons. The consumption of the photogenerated holes thus suppresses exciton recombination of COFs and improves the ratio of free electrons that were effectively utilized to drive catalytic reaction for HER. This work demonstrates a great potential of COF&#8208;catalyzed HER using alcohol solvents as hole scavengers and provides an example toward realizing the accessibility to the scope of reaction conditions and a greener route for energy conversion.

Combining in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS, operando XAFS measurements, and DFT calculations revealed that Fe1&#8208;P/NG accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process of CO2 electroreduction by promoting the dissociation of water over the P sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalytic activity, but poor kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps still limit the overall performance toward the industrial scale. Here, we constructed a Fe&#8722;P atom paired catalyst onto nitrogen doped graphitic layer (Fe1/PNG) to accelerate PCET step. Fe1/PNG delivers an industrial CO current of 1&#8197;A with FECO over 90&#8201;% at 2.5&#8197;V in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly, overperforming the CO current of Fe1/NG by more than 300&#8201;%. We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8722;P atom pair using operando techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO2, and enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. This atom&#8208;pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis Towards Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy was developed to facilitate both C2H4 epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO) and CO2 reduction to C2H4 for improved tandem electrosynthesis of EO from CO2 and water. Single&#8208;atom Pt anchored on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) with a high atomic utilization and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O with stable Cu+ species served as highly efficient anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively.







Abstract
The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently has a mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4 to EO and CO2 to C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediate binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2&#8201;%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9&#8201;% at 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to those in the traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE as high as 41.1&#8201;% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed to construct the versatile 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;ABN) ring system with a variety of substitution patterns and then applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of six suaveoline and sarpagine alkaloids: macrophylline, suaveoline, norsuaveoline, affinisine, normacusine B and Na&#8208;Me&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine.







Abstract
An intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed in which bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) plays a dual role as an efficient Lewis acid and source of the bromide nucleophile. This approach enables the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform for the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products and drug molecules. Suitable substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization include 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, with good to excellent yields observed. Finally, we showcase the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total synthesis of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in a total of 9&#8211;14&#8197;steps. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of the aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement, and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.

         <title>Pb&#8208;Modified Ultrathin RuCu Nanoflowers for Active, Stable, and CO&#8208;resistant Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of ultrathin RuCu nanoflowers with Pb can modulate the adsorption abilities to *H, *OH, and *CO, thereby significantly promoting alkaline hydrogen oxidation catalysis. Consequently, the mass activity and specific activity of Pb1.04&#8208;RuCu NFs/C are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.







Abstract
CO poisoning of Pt group metal (PGM) catalysts is a chronic problem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H2 to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru&#8208;based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO&#8208;resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of *H, strengthen *OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) suggests that Pb acts as oxygen&#8208;rich site to regulate the behavior of the linear CO adsorption. The optimized Pb1.04&#8208;Ru92Cu8/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 and 5.55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru&#8208;based catalyst with high activity and strong CO&#8208;resistance for alkaline HOR, which may promote the fundamental researches on the rational design of functional catalysts.

         <title>Intrinsic Stress&#8208;strain in Barium Titanate Piezocatalysts Enabling Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Batteries with Low Overpotential and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic stress&#8208;assisted catalysis concept established provides an effective, practical strategy for accelerating the commercial application of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Benefiting from the piezopotential as the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers and the redox reaction kinetics, the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries can cycle steadily for 2200&#8197;h with a low overpotential.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising candidates for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, whereas their commercial application is hindered due to poor cyclic stability caused by the sluggish kinetics and cathode passivation. Herein, the intrinsic stress originated from the growth and decomposition of the discharge product (lithium peroxide, Li2O2) is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to induce the built&#8208;in electric field, further improving the reaction kinetics and interfacial Lithium ion (Li+) transport during cycling. Piezopotential caused by the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain of solid Li2O2 is capable of providing the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, enhancing the Li+ transfer, and thus improving the redox reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Combined with a variety of in situ characterizations, the catalytic mechanism of barium titanate (BTO), a typical piezoelectric material, was systematically investigated, and the effect of stress&#8208;strain transformation on the electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li+ interface transport for the Li&#8722;O2 batteries is clearly established. The findings provide deep insight into the surface coupling strategy between intrinsic stress and electric fields to regulate the electrochemical reaction kinetics behavior and enhance the interfacial Li+ transport for battery system.

         <title>Electrochemical NiH&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling of Alkyl Halides and Alkyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general protocol for electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes has been established, providing tunable linear and branched products. Alkyl halides perform dual function as both coupling substrates and hydrogen sources in this reaction. Excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope can be extended to late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecular structures.







Abstract
Herein, an electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes for the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds is firstly reported. Notably, alkyl halides serve dual function as coupling substrates and as hydrogen sources to generate NiH species under electrochemical conditions. The tunable nature of this reaction is realized by introducing an intramolecular coordinating group to the substrate, where the product can be easily adjusted to give the desired branched products. The method proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate scope, and affords moderate to excellent yields with over 70 examples, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug derivatives. Mechanistic insights offer evidence for an electrochemically driven coupling process. The sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be activated through single electron transfer (SET) by the nickel catalyst in its low valence state, generated by cathodic reduction, and the generation of NiH species from alkyl halides is pivotal to this transformation.

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron density of monomers based on three covalent organic frameworks. And, the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1 exhibited excellent activities for CO2 photoreduction, higher than VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the electron&#8208;deficient unit, electron&#8208;rich unit, and efficient charge transfer channel.







Abstract
The high local electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high selectivity of 97.1&#8201;%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA=pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.

         <title>Electrosynthesis and Microanalysis in Thin Layer: An Electrochemical Pipette for Rapid Electrolysis and Mechanistic Study of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin&#8208;layer approach is presented to bypass the area&#8208;volume restrictions of traditional electrolysis cells and perform minute&#8208;scale electrolysis reactions. Parallel electrolysis reactions, using multiple thin&#8208;layer electrodes (TLE), facilitate the design and study of electrosynthesis reactions. Hosting a microelectrode in the TLE provides an advanced tool for combining electroanalytical and electrosynthetic reactions.







Abstract
Electrochemistry represents unique approaches for the promotion and mechanistic study of chemical reactions and has garnered increasing attention in different areas of chemistry. This expansion necessitates the enhancement of the traditional electrochemical cells that are intrinsically constrained by mass transport limitations. Herein, we present an approach for designing an electrochemical cell by limiting the reaction chamber to a thin layer of solution, comparable to the thickness of the diffusion layer. This thin layer electrode (TLE) provides a modular platform to bypass the constraints of traditional electrolysis cells and perform electrolysis reactions in the timescale of electroanalytical techniques. The utility of the TLE for electrosynthetic applications benchmarked using NHPI&#8208;mediated electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization. The application of microscale electrolysis for the study of drug metabolites was showcased by elucidating the oxidation pathways of the paracetamol drug. Moreover, hosting a microelectrode in the TLE, was shown to enable real&#8208;time probing of the profiles of redox&#8208;active components of these rapid electrosynthesis reactions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Assembly of Copper Nanoclusters with Enhanced Electrochemical Excitation and Radiative Transition for Electrochemiluminescence
</title>

         <dc:description>
Transforming disordered aggregates to ordered assemblies lights up electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of CuNCs. A self&#8208;assembly strategy was adopted to promote the electrochemcial excitation and radiative transition, allowing efficient enhancement of the electrochemiluminescence (ECL). This work proposes a simple and effective way to improve the inherent ECL performance of metal NCs for bioassays and clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters with unique molecule&#8208;like electronic structures, high abundance, and low cost. However, the synthesis of CuNCs with high ECL efficiency and stability in a scalable manner remains challenging. Here, we report a facile gram&#8208;scale approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled CuNCs (CuNCsAssy) induced by ligands with exceptionally boosted anodic ECL and stability. Compared to the disordered aggregates that are inactive in ECL, the CuNCsAssy shows a record anodic ECL efficiency for CuNCs (10&#8201;%, wavelength&#8208;corrected, relative to Ru(bpy)3Cl2/tripropylamine). Mechanism studies revealed the unusual dual functions of ligands in simultaneously facilitating electrochemical excitation and radiative transition. Moreover, the assembly addressed the limitation of poor stability of conventional CuNCs. As a proof of concept, an ECL biosensor for alkaline phosphatase detection was successfully constructed with an ultralow limit of detection of 8.1&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;U/L.

         <title>Photo&#8208;thermal Cooperative Carbonylation of Ethanol with CO2 on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source has been achieved via photo&#8208;thermal cooperation on an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy, which are both abundant in SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O. The oxygen vacancies facilitate the thermal dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond, providing not only the carbonyl counterpart but also the active *H for photo&#8208;catalysis of CO2 to reactive CO on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x interfacial sites. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 86&#8201;% has been afforded.







Abstract
Carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source into value&#8208;added esters is of considerable significance and interest, while remains of great challenge due to the harsh conditions for activation of inert CO2 in that the harsh conditions result in undesired activation of &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and even cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in ethanol to deteriorate the specific activation of O&#8722;H bond. Herein, we propose a photo&#8208;thermal cooperative strategy for carbonylation of ethanol with CO2, in which CO2 is activated to reactive CO via photo&#8208;catalysis with the assistance of *H from thermally&#8208;catalyzed dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond. To achieve this proposal, an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy both abundant SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O (Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x) has been designed. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 85.6&#8201;% to targeted alcoholic O&#8722;H activation has been afforded in photo&#8208;thermal assisted gas&#8208;solid process under 3.29&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1 of UV/Vis light irradiation (144&#8201;&#176;C) and 0.2&#8197;MPa CO2. In the photo&#8208;driven activation of CO2 and following carbonylation, CO2 activation energy decreases to 12.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and the cleavage of alcoholic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond has been suppressed.

         <title>Proton Shuttling by Polyaniline of High Br&#248;nsted Basicity for Improved Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand how the Br&#248;nsted basicity of amines at the Cu/polymer interface enables to modulate the reaction pathway, PPy/Cu and PANI/Cu interfaces were successfully synthesized through an in situ electrochemical reconstruction approach. It was found that the neutral &#8208;NH&#8208; moieties in PPy enabled to afford a high CH4 selectivity, while the more basic benzenoid &#8208;NH&#8208; in PANI significantly promoted C2H4 production.







Abstract
Hybrid organic/inorganic composites with the organic phase tailored to modulate local chemical environment at the Cu surface arise as an enchanting category of catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A fundamental understanding on how the organics of different functionality, polarity, and hydrophobicity affect the reaction path is, however, still lacking to guide rational catalyst design. Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) manifesting different Br&#248;nsted basicity are compared for their regulatory roles on the CO2RR pathways regarding *CO coverage, proton source and interfacial polarity. Concerted efforts from in situ IR, Raman and operando modelling unveil that at the PPy/Cu interface with limited *CO coverage, hydridic *H produced by the Volmer step favors the carbon hydrogenation of *CO to form *CHO through a Tafel process; Whereas at the PANI/Cu interface with concentrated CO2 and high *CO coverage, protonic H+ shuttled through the benzenoid &#8208;NH&#8208; protonates the oxygen of *CO, yielding *COH for asymmetric coupling with nearby *CO to form *OCCOH under favored energetics. As a result of the tailored chemical environment, the restructured PANI/Cu composite demonstrates a high partial current density of 0.41&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a maximal Faraday efficiency of 67.5&#8201;% for ethylene production, ranking among states of the art.

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

A Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk, resulting in complete elimination of tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo.







Abstract
Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but the Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions between Polyvinyl Chloride and Conjugated Polymers Enable Excellent Mechanical Properties and High Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyvinyl chloride and the conjugated polymer PM6 were discovered, resulting in excellent mechanical properties in PM6/polyvinyl chloride thin films and high thermal/bending stability in organic solar cells.







Abstract
The incorporation of insulating polymers into conjugated polymers has been widely explored as a strategy to improve mechanical properties of flexible organic electronics. However, phase separation due to the immiscibility of these polymers has limited their effectiveness. In this study, we report the discovery of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions that enhances the miscibility between insulating and conjugated polymers, resulting in improved mechanical properties. Specifically, we have added polyvinyl chloride (PVC) into the conjugated polymer PM6 and observed a significant increase in solution viscosity, indicative of favorable miscibility between these two polymers. This phenomenon has been rarely observed in other insulating/conjugated polymer composites. Thin films of PM6/PVC exhibit a much&#8208;improved crack&#8208;onset strain of 19.35&#8201;%, compared to 10.12&#8201;% for pristine PM6 films. Analysis reveal that a &#8220;cyclohexyl&#8208;like&#8221; structure formed through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVC and PM6 acted as a cross&#8208;linking site in the thin films, leading to improved mechanical properties. Moreover, PM6/PVC blend films have demonstrated excellent thermal and bending stability when applied as an electron donor in organic solar cells. These findings provide new insights into non&#8208;covalent interactions that can be utilized to enhance the properties of conjugated polymers and may have potential applications in flexible organic electronics.

         <title>Complete Peripheral Fluorination of the Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor in Organic Solar Cells Yields Efficiency over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete peripheral fluorination was performed on a two&#8208;dimensional conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series small molecular acceptors (SMAs), rendering the acceptor CH8F with eight fluorine atoms on the molecular backbone. More importantly, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based organic solar cells has been achieved so far.







Abstract
Due to the intrinsically flexible molecular skeletons and loose aggregations, organic semiconductors, like small molecular acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), greatly suffer from larger structural/packing disorders and weaker intermolecular interactions comparing to their inorganic counterparts, further leading to hindered exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge carrier migration in resulting OSCs. To overcome this challenge, complete peripheral fluorination was performed on basis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series SMAs, rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding the molecular backbone. Benefitting from the broad 2D backbone, more importantly, strengthened fluorine&#8208;induced secondary interactions, CH8F and its D18 blends afford much enhanced and more ordered molecular packings accompanying with enlarged dielectric constants, reduced exciton binding energies and more obvious fibrillary networks comparing to CH6F controls. Consequently, D18:CH8F&#8208;based OSCs reached an excellent efficiency of 18.80&#8201;%, much better than that of 17.91&#8201;% for CH6F&#8208;based ones. More excitingly, by employing D18&#8208;Cl that possesses a highly similar structure to D18 as a third component, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based OSCs has been achieved so far. Our work demonstrates the dramatical structural multiformity of CH&#8208;series SMAs, meanwhile, their high potential for constructing record&#8208;breaking OSCs through peripheral fine&#8208;tuning.

         <title>Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Geminal Cross Couplings of Dihaloalkanes with Cr Catalysis: Rapid Access to Tertiary and Quaternary Alkanes via a Metal&#8211;Carbene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;component geminal couplings have been achieved by design of a chromium catalytic system using dihaloalkanes to selective react with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes/alkyl tosylates. These newly developed reactions are effective for rapidly forming tertiary and quaternary alkanes via a Cr carbene intermediate with a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism, showing great potential in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#8212;cleavage of two geminal bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;C/C&#8722;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada&#8208;type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C&#8208;halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Si bonds via a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three&#8208;component geminal cross couplings are value&#8208;addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of various monofluoroaromatics is disclosed with readily available aromatic silanes and germanes as coupling partners at room temperature. The flexibility of the binuclear gold catalyst skeleton and the noncovalent interactions between hexafluorobenzene and fluorobenzene can furnish a high para selectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2).







Abstract
The regioselectivity of C&#8722;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm=bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8722;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8722;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8722;Au(III)&#8722;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Stereoconvergent C&#8722;H Borylation of Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides through C&#8722;H borylation, providing a versatile means of creating stereodefined enamides. The remarkable feature of this methodology is its stereoconvergent nature, which enables the utilization of starting materials with both E and Z configurations.







Abstract
Enamides, functional derivatives of enamines, play a significant role as synthetic targets. However, the stereoselective synthesis of these molecules has posed a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry, particularly for acyclic enamides that are less thermodynamically stable. In this study, we present a general strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides by C&#8722;H borylation, which provides a versatile platform for generating the stereodefined enamides. Our approach involves the utilization of metalloid borenium cation, generated through the reaction of BBr3 and enamides in the presence of two different additives, avoiding any exogenous catalyst. Importantly, the stereoconvergent nature of this methodology allows for the use of starting materials with mixed E/Z configurations, thus highlighting the unique advantage of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations have shed light on the pivotal roles played by the two additives, the reactive boron species, and the phenomenon of stereoconvergence.

Applying external stimuli is critical to circumvent the limitations imposed by linear scaling relationships in electrocatalytic applications. Franziska Simone Hegner, Ferdi Karadas et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202308647) that the water oxidation electrocatalytic activity of Co&#8211;Fe Prussian blue could be enhanced under magnetic field and light irradiation, which originates from an external&#8208;stimulus sensitive spin&#8208;crossover process.

         <title>Inside Cover: Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ active repair and detection of hydrogen via ammonium persulfate (APS) and rotational Raman spectroscopy facilitates the responsible use of non&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes. The bridged heterodinuclear photocatalyst RuPtI2 used in photocatalytic hydrogen production can now be repaired via the simple addition of ammonium persulfate, as reported by Sven Rau, Boris Mizaikoff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202306287). Along with the innovative in situ detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy the applicability of active repair mechanisms for a wide range of reductive catalysts is demonstrated.

Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides have shown intriguing potential in CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202305530), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. With the Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it is demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.

A pH&#8208;responsive interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight molecular shuttle is reported by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202310643). The rotaxane molecular shuttle operates through the invertible pH&#8208;responsive translation of the macrocycle between two sites of interactions of the encircled axle. As illustrated by the picture, the two loops of the eight&#8208;shaped rotaxane may be interdependently loosened and tightened. Increasing conformational degree of freedom of a loop results in the decreasing conformational degree of freedom of the other one.

         <title>Protein&#8208;based Nanoparticles: From Drug Delivery to Imaging, Nanocatalysis and Protein Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, significant progress was made in the development of protein nanoparticles, transitioning from artificial assemblies for drug delivery, to multifunctional systems for nanocatalysis and protein therapy. Advanced biohybrid materials, combined with dynamic chemistries and mild methods of particle formation produce nanoparticles that take advantage of the catalytic activity or targeting capabilities of the underlying proteins and enzymes.







Abstract
Proteins and enzymes are versatile biomaterials for a wide range of medical applications due to their high specificity for receptors and substrates, high degradability, low toxicity, and overall good biocompatibility. Protein nanoparticles are formed by the arrangement of several native or modified proteins into nanometer&#8208;sized assemblies. In this review, we will focus on artificial nanoparticle systems, where proteins are the main structural element and not just an encapsulated payload. While under natural conditions, only certain proteins form defined aggregates and nanoparticles, chemical modifications or a change in the physical environment can further extend the pool of available building blocks. This allows the assembly of many globular proteins and even enzymes. These advances in preparation methods led to the emergence of new generations of nanosystems that extend beyond transport vehicles to diverse applications, from multifunctional drug delivery to imaging, nanocatalysis and protein therapy.

         <title>Tinkering with Mechanochemical Tools for Scale Up</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry is an environmentally benign approach to chemical processes, which has steadily gained momentum at both laboratory and preparative scales. However, mechanochemical methods are still in their infancy compared to conventional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Our Minireview highlights a series of scaled&#8208;up mechanochemical processes that aim to encourage further developments in implementing mechanochemistry for commercial and industrial use.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has steadily showcased examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both the laboratory and the preparative scale. In contrast to solution&#8208;based chemistry, mechanochemical processes have not yet been standardized, and thus scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this Minireview is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.

         <title>Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be designed and built up using multiple building blocks. Multicomponent MOFs employ building blocks that are distinct from one another and therefore occupy specific lattice positions. By maintaining periodicity while circumventing randomness and disorder, these materials enable exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Typical MOFs are rather simple, comprising just one type of joint and linker. An additional degree of structural complexity can be introduced by using multiple different components that are assembled into the same framework In the early days of MOF chemistry, conventional wisdom held that attempting to prepare frameworks starting from such a broad set of components would lead to multiple different phases. However, this review highlights how this view was mistaken and frameworks comprising multiple different components can be deliberately designed and synthesized. When coupled to structural order and periodicity, the presence of multiple components leads to exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.

         <title>Polymerization Induced Microphase Separation for the Fabrication of Nanostructured Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) uses the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers during bulk polymerization to create nanostructured materials with highly tunable domain sizes and morphologies, including highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PIMS chemistry, and explores the wide variety of materials and applications accessible by the PIMS technique.







Abstract
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed with at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nanostructured materials with the highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11&#8197;years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence&#8208;based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multifunctional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the total biosynthesis of the melleolide sesquiterpenoids produced by Basidiomycota fungi revealed that the glucose&#8208;methanol&#8208;choline oxidase enzyme Mld7 is a key enzyme that catalyzes multistep reactions leading to two different types of melleolides. Notably, these two reactions are highly regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.







Abstract
Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation of the &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight of the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation&#8208;triggered double&#8208;bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl&#8208;group&#8208;assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the &#916;7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives, such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by DFT calculations. Of particular importance is that product distribution is regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.

         <title>Noncovalent Modification of Cycloparaphenylene by Catenane Formation Using an Active Metal Template Strategy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane, which consists of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle, has been synthesized by an active metal template strategy. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation at the bipyridine macrocycle moiety illustrated the efficient post&#8208;functionalization of the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. The structural and photophysical properties of the Ag complex of [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane were also studied.







Abstract
The active metal template (AMT) strategy is a powerful tool for the formation of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes and catenanes, allowing the synthesis of a variety of MIMs, including &#960;&#8208;conjugated and multicomponent macrocycles. Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) is an emerging molecule characterized by its cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and unique properties. Therefore, diverse modifications of CPPs are necessary for its wide application. However, most CPP modifications require early stage functionalization and the direct modification of CPPs is very limited. Herein, we report the synthesis of a catenane consisting of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle as a new CPP analogue that contains a reliable synthetic scaffold enabling diverse and concise post&#8208;modification. Following the AMT strategy, the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane was successfully synthesized through Ni&#8208;mediated aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation of the bipyridine macrocycle moiety, an effective post&#8208;functionalization method, were also demonstrated with the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed that the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane forms a tridentated complex with an Ag ion inside the CPP ring. This interaction significantly enhances the phosphorescence lifetime through improved intermolecular interactions.

         <title>N,O&#8208;Benzylidene Acetal Dipeptides (NBDs) Enable the Synthesis of Difficult Peptides via a Kinked Backbone Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) can serve as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and highly effective building blocks to enable syntheses of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked peptide backbone strategy. The scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis and the proven effectiveness for the synthesis of difficult peptides render NBDs valuable tools for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in both academic research and industrial applications.







Abstract
Proteins with highly hydrophobic regions or aggregation&#8208;prone sequences are typically difficult targets for chemical synthesis at the current stage, as obtaining such type of peptides via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis requires sophisticated operations. Herein, we report N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) as robust and effective building blocks to allow the direct synthesis of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked backbone strategy. The effectiveness and easy accessibility of NBDs have been well demonstrated in our chemical syntheses of various challenging peptides and proteins, including chemokine, therapeutic hormones, histone, and glycosylated erythropoietin.

A two&#8208;station figure of eight rotaxane molecular shuttle has been synthesized by making use of a template&#8208;driven intramolecular self&#8208;entanglement of a hermaphrodite disubstituted dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 derivative and the mechanical locking of the architecture. The shuttling of the macrocycle from the ammonium to the triazolium station results in an interdependent tightening/loosening of the two loops of the interlocked molecular architecture.







Abstract
Here is reported the synthesis and characterization of an interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane molecular shuttle from a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) derivative. This latter bears two molecular chains, whose extremities are able to react together by click chemistry. One of the two substituting chain holds an ammonium function aimed at driving the self&#8208;entanglement through the complexation of the DB24C8 moiety. In the targeted figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane, shuttling of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle from the best ammonium station to the weaker binding site triazolium was performed through deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium. This way, two discrete co&#8208;conformational states were obtained, in which the folding and size of the two loops could be changed.

         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical type (3+3) cycloaddition of cyclopropane is realized with aryl cyclopropane and nitrone under photoredox catalysis in a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. The reaction includes a stereospecific three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic ring opening and a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization.







Abstract
By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrate the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction takes place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. A mechanism involving an aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst based on a tubular photosensitive carbon nitride (CN) and a conductive zinc&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)) catalytic unit is fabricated for H2O2 photosynthesis. The annealing&#8208;induced shrinkage of the Zn&#8208;O4 moiety in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) unlocks its capability for O2 reduction to H2O2, and meanwhile, the strong interaction between these two components facilitates the photoelectron injection from CN to the activated Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in &#176;C), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8722; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Shape Control of Carbon Nanoparticles via a Simple Anion&#8208;Directed Strategy for Precise Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;directed strategy was developed to control the shapes of carbon nanoparticles (CNs) from spheres to rods with various aspect ratios (ARs). This shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions induced self&#8208;assembly followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods.







Abstract
Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. Based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson's correlation coefficient up to 0.90. This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.

         <title>Electron Delocalization Enables Sulfone&#8208;based Single&#8208;solvent Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron delocalization through resonance and electron withdrawing effect by F substitution solves the wettability issue and addresses the Li metal anode instability of sulfone solvents to enable the use of sulfone&#8208;based single&#8208;solvent single&#8208;salt electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMB), although providing high energy density, face the grand challenge of identifying good electrolyte solvents for cycling. Common solvents are either only stable against lithium metal anode or only stable against LiNixMnyCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. One example is the sulfone&#8208;based electrolyte. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the electrons through introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li+. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMB under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21&#8197;mg/cm2 NMC811 and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li) with 90&#8201;% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.

         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of enamides or enecarbamates with racemic &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts with full control of the newly formed vicinal stereocenters is reported. A wide variety of enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically enriched chiral &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives were directly obtained through a key sequential process of enantioselective hydronickelation&#8211;enantioconvergent alkylation.







Abstract
Catalytic methods which control multiple stereogenic centers simultaneously are highly desirable in modern organic synthesis and chemical manufacturing. Herein, we report a regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation process which proceeds with simultaneous control of vicinal stereocenters originating from two readily accessible partners, prochiral internal alkenes (enamides or enecarbamates) and racemic alkyl electrophiles (&#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts). This reaction produces high&#8208;value &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives under mild conditions and with precise selectivity. Preliminary studies of the mechanism indicate that the reaction involves an enantioselective syn&#8208;hydronickelation to generate an enantiomerically enriched alkylnickel(II) species. Subsequent enantioconvergent alkylation with a racemic alkyl electrophile generates the desired product as a single stereoisomer.

&lt;p&gt;A regio-, enantio-, and diastereoselective NiH-catalyzed hydroalkylation of enamides or enecarbamates with racemic &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-bromoamides or Katritzky salts with full control of the newly formed vicinal stereocenters is reported.

         <title>Merging the Isonitrile&#8208;Tetrazine (4+1) Cycloaddition and the Ugi Four&#8208;Component Reaction into a Single Multicomponent Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multicomponent process combining the features of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4 +1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction was developed. The multicomponent reaction takes advantage of the click reactivities of the first step and provides access to so&#8208;far inaccessible chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are of utmost importance at generating a unique, wide, and complex chemical space. Herein we describe a novel multicomponent approach based on the combination of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4+1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction to generate pyrazole amide derivatives. The scope of the reaction as well as mechanistic insights governing the 4H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;imine tautomerization are provided. This multicomponent process provides access to a new chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives and offers a tool for peptide modification and stapling.

         <title>Supramolecular Subphthalocyanine Cage as Catalytic Container for the Functionalization of Fullerenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage has been shown to catalyze the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between C60 and anthracene in water to yield mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;adducts with high regioselectivity. Catalytic amounts of the cage led to better conversions because it favours co&#8208;encapsulation of the substrates in the hydrophobic cavity. Moreover, the larger binding affinity of the cage for C60 compared to the resulting adducts enables catalytic turnover.







Abstract
Herein we report the first example of a supramolecular cage that works as a catalytic molecular reactor to perform transformations over fullerenes in aqueous medium. Taking advantage of the ability of metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine (SubPc) capsules to form stable host:guest complexes with C60, we have prepared a water&#8208;soluble cage that provides a hydrophobic environment for conducting cycloadditions over encapsulated C60, namely, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with anthracene. Indeed, the presence of catalytic amounts of SubPc cage dissolved in water promotes co&#8208;encapsulation of insoluble C60 and anthracene substrates, allowing the reaction to occur inside the cavity under mild conditions. The lower stability of the host:guest complex with the resulting C60 cycloadduct facilitates its displacement by pristine C60, which grants catalytic turnover. Moreover, bis&#8208;addition compounds are regioselectively formed inside the cage when using excess anthracene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Allylation of Ketones with Allenylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuH&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and regiodivergent allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes has been developed. Various tertiary homoallylic alcohols bearing an alkenyl silane or an allyl silane group were synthesized with high regioselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
We report herein a regiodivergent and enantioselective allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes through copper catalysis. With the combination of CuOAc, a Josiphos&#8208;type bidentate phosphine ligand and PhSiH3, allyl addition to a variety of ketones furnishes branched products in excellent enantioselectivities. The regioselectivity is completely reversed by employing the P&#8208;stereogenic ligand BenzP*, affording the linear products with excellent enantioselectivities and good Z&#8208;selectivities. The linear Z&#8208;product could be converted to E&#8208;product via a catalytic geometric isomerization of the Z&#8208;alkene group. The silyl group in the products could provide a handle for downstream elaboration.

         <title>Cu2+&#8208;Anchored Carbon Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts for Visible Water Splitting to Boost Hydrogen Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)&#8208;anchored CD&#8208;doped C3N4 nanosheet (Cu@CDCN) enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic generation of H2. Cu2+ efficiently catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 and reduces photocatalyst poisoning by H2O2, which promotes the conversion to Cu+ and boosts cuproptosis. Cu@CDCN with efficient photocatalytic H2 production and anchored Cu2+ enables a combination of hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis that can cause mitochondrial damage and inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Both hydrogen (H2) and copper ions (Cu+) can be used as anti&#8208;cancer treatments. However, the continuous generation of H2 molecules and Cu+ in specific sites of tumors is challenging. Here we anchored Cu2+ on carbon photocatalyst (Cu@CDCN) to allow the continuous generation of H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors using the two&#8208;electron process of visible water splitting. The photocatalytic process also generated redox&#8208;active Cu&#8208;carbon centers. Meanwhile, the Cu2+ residues reacted with H2O2 (the obstacle to the photocatalytic process) to accelerate the two&#8208;electron process of water splitting and cuprous ion (Cu+) generation, in which the Cu2+ residue promoted a pro&#8208;oxidant effect with glutathione through metal&#8208;reducing actions. Both H2 and Cu+ induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction, which enabled hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis to inhibit cancer cell growth and suppress tumor growth. Our research is the first attempt to integrate hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis using metal&#8208;enhanced visible solar water splitting in nanomedicine, which may provide a safe and effective cancer treatment.

         <title>Taming of Furfurylidenes by Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Catalysts. Preparation and Functionalization of Optically Active 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (Trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes represent bioisosteres of tert&#8208;butyl groups of improved metabolic stability; they are on high demand in medicinal chemistry but difficult to make in optically active form. A new approach, which engages a bench&#8208;stable carbene source in asymmetric cyclopropanation catalyzed by a [BiRh] paddlewheel complex, opens ready access to compounds of this type.







Abstract
Although 2&#8208;furyl&#8208;carbenes (furfurylidenes) are prone to instantaneous electrocyclic ring opening, chiral [BiRh]&#8208;paddlewheel complexes empowered by London dispersion allow (trifluoromethyl)furfurylidene metal complexes to be generated from a bench&#8208;stable triftosylhydrazone precursor. These reactive intermediates engage in asymmetric [2+1] cycloadditions and hence open entry into valuable trifluoromethylated cyclopropane or &#8208;cyclopropene derivatives in optically active form, which are important building blocks for medicinal chemistry but difficult to make otherwise.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in Mononuclear Yb/Sm Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Sm3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion from Sm3+ at room temperature. This promising system opens powerful horizons for new upconverting material using co&#8208;crystal assemblies.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based upconversion luminescence transforming high&#8208;energy photons into low&#8208;energy photons is an attractive anti&#8208;Stokes shift process for fundamental research and promising applications. In this work, we developed the upconversion luminescence in co&#8208;crystal assemblies consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes. The characteristic visible emissions of Sm3+ were observed under the excitation of absorption band of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm. A series of co&#8208;crystal assemblies were investigated based on mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes, and the strongest luminescence was obtained when the molar concentration between Yb3+ and Sm3+ is equivalent. The crystal structure was fully characterized by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and upconverting energy transfer mechanisms were verified as cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion. This is the first example of Sm3+&#8208;based upconverting luminescence in discrete lanthanide complexes which present as co&#8208;crystal assemblies at room temperature.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence in Multi&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Type Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules has been observed. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion in organic molecular systems is one of the promising technologies for future energy harvesting systems because these systems can generate excitons that possess higher energy than excitation energy. The photon&#8208;upconversion caused by absorbing ambient heat as additional energy is particularly interesting because it could ideally provide a light&#8208;driving cooling system. However, only a few organic molecular systems have been reported. Here, we report the anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state. The anti&#8208;Stokes shift corresponded well to the 1&#8211;0 vibration transition from the ground state to the excited singlet state, and we further evaluated a correlation between the activation energy for the ASPL intensity and the TADF process. Our demonstration underlines that MR&#8208;TADF molecules have become a novel class of ASPL materials for various future applications, such as light&#8208;driving cooling systems.

         <title>Photochemical Oximesulfonylation of Alkenes Using Sulfonyl&#8208;Oxime&#8208;Ethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient metal free photochemical method for regioselective incorporation of oxime ether and sulfonyl functionality to olefin using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents is demonstrated. The process exhibits a wide substrate scope providing rapid access to 1,2&#8208;oximesulfonylated products in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Utilization of oxime ethers as bifunctional reagents remains unknown. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy that enables oximesulfonylation of olefins using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents under metal&#8208;free photochemical conditions. Via concomitant C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, the process permits incorporation of oxime and sulfonyl groups into olefins in a complete atom&#8208;economic fashion, providing rapid access to multi&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl oxime ethers with good yields and stereoselectivity. The method is amenable to functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and is shown to be scalable. A radical chain mechanism initiated via photochemical Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mediated N&#8722;O bond cleavage is suggested for the process, based on our results on mechanistic investigations.

         <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing and Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated State Induced by Through&#8208;Space Intramolecular Charge Transfer in a Parallel Geometry Carbazole&#8208;Bodipy Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer, a compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor (carbazole&#8208;bodipy) dyad with face&#8208;to&#8208;face geometry exhibits long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns) and efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%). This discovery opens a new avenue for designing efficient photosensitizers and photonic applications that depend on long&#8208;lived excited states generation.







Abstract
The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T=186&#8197;&#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ&#8208;1 compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916;=0.4&#8201;%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11&#8201;% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.

Herein, we propose using parallel (face-to-face) conformation carbazole-bodipy donor-acceptor dyads (BCZ-1 and BCZ-2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;&#916;&lt;/sub&gt;=61&#8201;%) and long-lived triplet excited state (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=186&#8197;&#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ-1 compared to BCZ-3 (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;&#916;&lt;/sub&gt;=0.4&#8201;%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor-acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long-lived charge-separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ-1 (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;CSS&lt;/sub&gt;=24&#8197;ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11&#8201;% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective CO2 &#8208;to&#8208; Syngas Conversion Enabled by Bimetallic Gold/Zinc Sites in Partially Reductived Au/ZnO Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (gaseous mixture of CO and H2) is a promising way to curb excessive CO2 emission and the greenhouse gas effect. Herein, we present a bimetallic AuZn@ZnO (AuZn/ZnO) catalyst with high efficiency and durability for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 66.4% for CO (corrected current density of 0.38&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8208;2) and 26.5% for H2 and a 3&#8201;h CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas at &#8208;0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). And the CO/H2 ratio shows a wide range from 0.25 to 2.50 over a narrow potential window (&#8208;0.7 V to &#8208;1.1 V vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the bimetallic synergistic effect between Au and Zn lower the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and facilitate electronic transfer, further highlight the potential to control the CO/H2 ratios for efficient syngas production using the coexisting Au sites and Zn sites.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous/Organic Hybrid Batteries Enabled by Cu2+ Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium||sulfur (Li||S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of S cathodes, as well as the low redox potential of Li metal anodes (&#8208;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the S reduction reaction from S to Li2S leads to limited discharge voltage and capacity, largely hindering the energy density of Li||S batteries. Herein, high&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via an electrolyte decoupling strategy. In cathodes, S electrodes undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction from S to Cu2S with four&#8208;electron transfer in a Cu2+&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance of S electrodes, including high discharge potential and capacity, superior rate performance and stable cycling behavior. As a result, the assembled Li||S hybrid batteries exhibit a high discharge voltage of 3.4 V and satisfactory capacity of 2.3 Ah g&#8208;1, contributing to incredible energy density. This work provides an opportunity for the construction of high&#8208;energy Li||S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Fluid Interface Enables Spatiotemporal Regulation of Ligand Distribution to Increase Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Interfacial Binding Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, receptor&#8208;ligand binding reactions within interfaces often achieve optimum binding kinetics and thermodynamics by regulating the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial receptors/ligands. Inspired by this, we report a hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) to regulate spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial ligands to increase the rates and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions. Each spherical aptamer (SAPT) is anchored on supported lipid bilayers without fluidity as an &#8220;island&#8221;, and surrounded by many fluorescent aptamers (FAPTs) with free fluidity as &#8220;rafts&#8221;. Such ligand &#8220;island&#8208;raft&#8221; models provide large reactive cross&#8208;sections for rapid binding. The synergistic multivalency of SAPTs and FAPTs improves interfacial affinity for tight capture. Moreover, FAPTs accumulate at binding sites to bind to cellular receptors with clustered fluorescence to &#8220;lighten&#8221; cells for direct identification. Thus, HieFluidFace in a microfluidic chip achieves high&#8208;performance capture and identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples, providing a new paradigm to optimize the kinetics and thermodynamics of interfacial binding reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4 and H2O2 under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 requires photosensitizers and sacrificial agents to provide sufficient electrons and protons through metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, and the separation of CH4 from by&#8208;product O2 has poor applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst of a novel electron&#8208;acceptor 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PT), to our best knowledge, this is the first time that metal&#8208;free catalyst achieves non&#8208;sacrificial photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 and easily separable H2O2. This photocatalyst offers CH4 product of 10.6 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions (room temperature, and only water), which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi&#8208;step reaction mechanism, in which the long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO2 activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH4 product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to easily separable CH4 in non&#8208;sacrificial and metal&#8208;free conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating a Defined Chirality in Amino Acids and Cyclic Dipeptides by Photochemical Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines underwent stereochemical editing at position C6 leading to the formation of products with a defined configuration which was retained in consecutive reactions. Spectroscopic evidence was collected corroborating a hydrogen atom transfer to the photocatalyst as the pivotal step of the process.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazines are cyclic dipeptides displaying a wide range of applications. Their enantioselective preparation has now been found possible from the respective racemates by a photochemical deracemization (53 examples, 74&#8201;% to quantitative yield, 71&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A chiral benzophenone catalyst in concert with irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm enables to establish the configuration at the stereogenic carbon atom C6 at will. If other stereogenic centers are present in the diketopiperazines they remain unaffected and a stereochemical editing is possible at a single position. Consecutive reactions, including the conversion into N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl amino acids or the reduction to piperazines, occur without compromising the newly created stereogenic center. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzophenone catalyst processes one enantiomer of the 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines preferentially and enables a reversible hydrogen atom transfer that is responsible for the deracemization process. The remarkably long lifetime of the protonated ketyl radical implies a yet unprecedented mode of action.

         <title>Superstructure&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Assemblies for Nanoconfined Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic assemblies based on pillararene&#8208;strutted covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been developed as highly efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles). The pillararenes in the assemblies play an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, thus providing valuable insights into the construction of multifunctional porous materials with innovative and designable functions.







Abstract
Most attempts to synthesize supramolecular nanosystems are limited to a single mechanism, often resulting in the formation of nanomaterials that lack diversity in properties. Herein, hierarchical assemblies with appropriate variety are fabricated in bulk via a superstructure&#8208;induced organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid strategy. The dynamic balance between substructures and superstructures is managed using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as dual building blocks to regulate the performances of hierarchical assemblies. Significantly, the superstructures resulting from the controlled cascade between COFs and MOFs create highly active photocatalytic systems through multiple topologies. Our designed tandem photocatalysis can precisely and efficiently regulate the conversion rates of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles) through competing redox pathways. Furthermore, benzo[d]imidazoles catalyzed by such supramolecular nanosystems can be isolated in yields ranging from 70&#8201;% to 93&#8201;% within tens of minutes. The multilayered structural states within the supramolecular systems demonstrate the importance of hierarchical assemblies in facilitating photocatalytic propagation and expanding the structural repertoire of supramolecular hybrids.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Decorated Organoboron Emitters with Low&#8208;Lying HOMO Levels for Solution&#8208;Processed Narrowband Blue Hyperfluorescence OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrowband blue emitter with low&#8208;lying the highest occupied molecular orbital level was developed by decorating the multiple resonance core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which suppresses hole trapping effect for facilitating hole transport and avoiding exciton quenching. The optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence device simultaneously obtains record high external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 16.6&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The hyperfluorescence has drawn great attention in achieving efficient narrowband emitting devices based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, achieving efficient solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices is still a challenge, due to the unbalanced charge transport and serious exciton quenching caused by that the holes are easily trapped on the high&#8208;lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of traditional diphenylamine&#8208;decorated emitters. Here, we developed two narrowband blue organoboron emitters with low&#8208;lying HOMO levels by decorating the MR&#8208;TADF core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which could suppress the hole trapping effect by reducing the hole traps between host and MR&#8208;TADF emitter from deep (0.40&#8197;eV) to shallow (0.14/0.20&#8197;eV) ones for facilitating hole transport and exciton formation, as well as avoiding exciton quenching. And the large dihedral angle between the carbazole and MR&#8208;TADF core makes the carbazole act as a steric hindrance to inhibit molecular aggregation. Accordingly, the optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices simultaneously realize record external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;%, narrowband emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 16.6&#8197;nm, and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.139, 0.189), which is the best result for the solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Artificial Organelle Corrects Microenvironment Interference for Accurate Intratumoral Glucose Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle is reported by immobilizing enzymes within porous coordination polymers. The acid&#8208;digested bi&#8208;enzymes cascade core shows boosted catalytic efficiency for sensitive signal transduction, while the stable shell integrating catalase not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic state to maximize glucose oxidation, enabling accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.







Abstract
Enzymatic catalysis with high efficiency allows them a great prospect in metabolite monitoring in living cells. However, complex tumor microenvironments, such as acidity, H2O2, and hypoxia, are bound to disturb catalytic reactions for misleading results. Here, we report a spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle to correct intratumoral glucose analysis, where the zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 immobilized glucose oxidase&#8208;horseradish peroxidase cascade core and catalase&#8208;directed shell act as signal transduction and guarding rooms respectively. The acid&#8208;digested core and stable shell provide appropriate spaces to boost biocatalytic efficiency with good tolerability. Notably, the endogenous H2O2 is in situ decomposed to O2 by catalase, which not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic states to maximize glucose oxidation. The marked protective effect and biocompatibility render artificial organelles to correct the signal transduction for dynamic monitoring glucose in vitro and in vivo, achieving our goal of accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.

A rechargeable Na/Cl2 battery with an ultrahigh rate capability (16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) has been realized using a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which enables efficient Na+ and electron transport and promoted Cl2 adsorption and conversion. It provides a new paradigm to solve the dilemma between energy density and power density in energy storage devices.







Abstract
Rechargeable sodium/chlorine (Na/Cl2) batteries are emerging candidates for sustainable energy storage owing to their superior energy densities and the high abundance of Na and Cl elements. However, their practical applications have been plagued by the poor rate performance (e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), as the widely used carbon nanosphere cathodes show both sluggish electron&#8208;ion transport and reaction kinetics. Here, by mimicking the sufficient mass and energy transport in a sponge, we report a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which allows efficient Na+ and electron transport and promotes Cl2 adsorption and conversion, thus unlocking ultrahigh&#8208;rate Na/Cl2 batteries, e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 that is more than two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. The optimized solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas (carbon&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;Cl2) triple interfaces further contribute to a maximum reversible capacity and cycle life of 2,000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 250&#8197;cycles, respectively. This study establishes a universal approach for improving the sluggish kinetics of conversion&#8208;type battery reactions, and provides a new paradigm to resolve the long&#8208;standing dilemma between high energy and power densities in energy storage devices.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutenes from a Common Scaffold: Enantioselective Desymmetrization via Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four&#8208;membered carbocycles are important structural motifs found in several natural products and drugs. Amongst those, cyclobutenes are attractive intermediates because the residual olefin can be manipulated selectively into numerous saturated and unsaturated analogs. Few methods exist to access chiral tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and they are generally limited in terms of diversification. Herein, a divergent synthetic strategy was developed where a single optically enriched scaffold is diversified into a variety of derivatives with different substitution patterns. To this end, the enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral 1,2&#8208;dibromocyclobutene imides was enabled by a dual Ir/Ni&#8208;catalyzed photoredox C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling with an alkyltrifluoroborate salt to install a convertible carbon fragment in good yields and &gt;90% enantiomeric excess. Exceptional mono&#8208;coupling selectivity is observed and the resulting chiral bromocyclobutene serves as a common scaffold that can be transformed in a divergent manner into several valuable 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutane products while maintaining optical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mushroom P450&#8208;Monooxygenase Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Biocatalytic Synthesis of Epoxycyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An epoxycyclohexenone (ECH) moiety occurs in natural products of both bacteria and ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. While the enzymes for ECH formation in bacteria and ascomycetes have been identified and characterized, it remained obscure how this structure is biosynthesized in basidiomycetes. In this study, we i) identified a genetic locus responsible for panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis and ii) biochemically characterized PanH, the cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing epoxide formation in this pathway. Using a PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst, we synthesized a small library of bioactive ECH compounds as a proof of concept. Furthermore, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and site directed mutation revealed the substrate specificity of PanH. Remarkably, PanH is unrelated to ECH&#8208;forming enzymes in bacteria and ascomycetes, suggesting that mushrooms evolved this biosynthetic capacity convergently and independently of other organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Flexible Dielectric Films from Solution Processable Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are known to be a promising class of materials for a wide range of applications, yet their poor solution processability limits their utility in many areas. Here we report a pore engineering method using hydrophilic side chains to improve the processability of hydrazone and &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs and the production of flexible, crystalline films. Mechanical measurements of the free&#8208;standing COF films of COF&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (hydrazone&#8208;linked) and TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked), revealed a Young&#8217;s modulus of 391.7 MPa and 1034.7 MPa, respectively. The solubility and excellent mechanical properties enabled the use of these COFs in dielectric devices. Specifically, the TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 film&#8208;based dielectric capacitors display simultaneously high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, resulting in a discharged energy density of 11.22 J cm&#8211;3. This work offers a general approach for producing solution processable COFs and mechanically flexible COF&#8208;based films, which hold great potential for use in energy storage and flexible electronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition Regulates Coordination Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination engineering for single&#8208;atom sites has drawn increasing attention, yet its chemical synthesis remains a tough issue, especially for tailorable coordination structures. Herein, a molecular recognition strategy is proposed to fabricate single&#8208;atom sites with regulable local coordination structures. Specifically, a heteroatom&#8208;containing ligand serves as the guest molecule to induce coordination interaction with the metal&#8208;containing host, precisely settling the heteroatoms into the local structure of single&#8208;atom sites. As a proof of concept, thiophene is selected as the guest molecule, and sulfur atoms are successfully introduced into the local coordination structure of iron single&#8208;atom sites. Ultrahigh oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity is achieved with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the strategy possesses excellent universality towards diversified types of single&#8208;atom sites. This work makes breakthroughs in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and affords new opportunities in structural regulation at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of an Air&#8208;Stable, High&#8208;Spin Diradical with Diazapyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable carbon&#8208;based polyradicals exhibiting strong spin&#8208;spin coupling and slow depolarization processes are particularly attractive functional materials. A new molecular motif with convenient synthesis method allowing for adaptable integration of stable, high&#8208;spin radicals to (hetero)aromatic polycycles is developed, as illustrated by a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical showing triplet ground state with long persistency (&#964;1/2~31 h) in the air.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stable carbon-based polyradicals exhibiting strong spin-spin coupling and slow depolarization processes are particularly attractive functional materials. A new molecular motif with convenient synthesis method allowing for adaptable integration of stable, high-spin radicals to (hetero)aromatic polycycles is developed, as illustrated by a non-Kekul&#233; diradical showing triplet ground state with long persistency (&#964;1/2~31 h) in the air.

         <title>Thermally Responsive Selenide&#8208;containing Materials Based on Transalkylation of Selenonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) possess unique properties as a result of their internal dynamic bonds, such as self&#8208;healing and reprocessing abilities. In this study, we report a thermally responsive C&#8208;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation exchange between selenonium salts and selenides, which undergo a fast transalkylation reaction in the absence of any catalyst. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of a dissociative mechanism in the absence of selenide groups. After incorporation of this DCC into selenide&#8208;containing polymer materials, it was observed that the cross&#8208;linked networks display varying dynamic exchange rates when using different alkylation reagents, suggesting that the reprocessing capacity of selenide&#8208;containing materials can be regulated. Also, by incorporating selenonium salts into polymer materials, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as excellent solvent resistance at ambient temperature. This novel dynamic covalent chemistry thus provides a straightforward method for the healing and reprocessing of selenide&#8208;containing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Coding intrinsic disorder into DNA hybridization probes enables discrimination of single nucleotide variants over wide and tunable temperature ranges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA hybridization probes are commonly used tools to discriminate clinically important single nucleotide variants (SNVs) but often work at elevated temperatures with very narrow temperature intervals (&#8710;T). Herein, we investigated the thermodynamic basis of the narrow &#8710;T both in silico and experimentally. Our study revealed that the high entropy penalty of classic hybridization probe designs was the key attributor for the narrow &#8710;T. Guided by this finding, we further introduced an entropy&#8208;compensate probe (Sprobe) design by coding intrinsic disorder into a stem&#8208;loop hybridization probe. Sprobe expanded &#8710;T from less than 10 &#176;C to over 30 &#176;C. Moreover, both &#8710;T and the optimal reaction temperature can be fine&#8208;tuned by simply altering the length of the loop domain. Sprobe was clinically validated by analyzing EGFR L858R mutation in 36 pairs of clinical tumor tissue samples collected from lung cancer patients, which revealed 100% clinical sensitivity and specificity. We anticipate that our study will serve as a general guide for designing thermal robust hybridization probes for clinical diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulate Multiple Resonance Delayed Fluorescence via Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited State towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters usually suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching. Here, we report the design of a sandwich structure by placing the B&#8208;N MR core between two electron&#8208;donating moieties, inducing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) states. The proper adjusting of the energy levels brings about a 10&#8208;fold higher RISC rate in comparison with the parent B&#8208;N molecule. In the meantime, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91% and a good color purity were maintained. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new MR emitter achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.7% and small roll&#8208;offs at high brightness. High device efficiencies were also obtained for a wide range of doping concentrations of up to 20 wt% thanks to the steric shielding of the B&#8208;N core. A good operational stability with LT95 of 85.2 h has also been revealed. The dual steric and electronic effects resulting from the introduction of a TSCT state offer an effective molecular design to address the critical challenges of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anilines are potentially high&#8208;value arylating agents, but are limited by the low reactivity of the strong C&#8208;N bond. We show that the reactive intermediate benzyne can be used to both activate anilines, and set&#8208;up an aryl transfer reaction in a single step. The reaction does not require any transition metal catalysis or stoichiometric organometallics, and establishes a metal&#8208;free route to valuable biaryl products by functionalizing the aniline C&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Multi&#8208;Block and Multi&#8208;Block+ Strategies for the Upcycling of Mixed Polyolefins and Other Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their end&#8208;of&#8208;life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. Multi&#8208;block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with tunable microstructures, which were then used as com&#8208;patibilizer additives to upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic blends. The polymer multi&#8208;block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis and the multi&#8208;block+ strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;methylene C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of linear free carboxylic acids remains a significant challenge. Here in we report a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem &#947;&#8208;arylation and &#947;&#8208;lactonization of aliphatic acids enabled by a L,X&#8208;type CarboxPyridone ligand. A wide range of &#947;&#8208;arylated &#947;&#8208;lactones are synthesized in a single step from aliphatic acids in moderate to good yield. Arylated lactones can readily be converted into disubstituted tetrahydrofurans, a prominent scaffold amongst bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins on a Silicon Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorption of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) on silicon is investigated in a combined scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory study. We find that both of the studied NHOs bind covalently, with ylidic character, to the silicon adatoms of the substrate and exhibit good thermal stability. The adsorption geometry strongly depends on the N&#8208;substituents: for large N&#8208;substituents, an upright adsorption geometry is favored, while a flat&#8208;lying geometry is found for the NHO with smaller wingtips. These different geometries strongly influence the quality and properties of the obtained monolayers. The upright geometry leads to the formation of ordered monolayers, whereas the flat&#8208;lying NHOs yield a mostly disordered, but denser, monolayer. The obtained monolayers both show large work function reductions, as the higher density of the flat&#8208;lying monolayer is found to compensate for the smaller vertical dipole moments. Our findings offer new prospects in the design of tailor&#8208;made ligand structures in organic electronics and optoelectronics, catalysis, and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Regiodivergent Alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Activated by Distinct Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8211;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Class of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is emerging as one of the important non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques in biomedical research. Small molecule&#8208; second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) PA dyes combined with imaging data can provide comprehensive and in&#8208;depth in vivo physiological and pathological information. However, the NIR&#8208;II PA dyes usually exhibit &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; properties due to the lack of a readily optically tunable group, which hinders the further applications in vivo. Herein, a novel class of dyes GX have been designed and synthesized as the activatable NIR&#8208;II PA platform, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360 nm. Importantly, dyes GX have a strong tissue penetration depth and high&#8208;resolution for the mouse vasculature structures in NIR&#8208;II PA 3D imaging and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) imaging. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II PA probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by carbon monoxide (CO) was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in the hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging. We expect that many derivatives of dyes GX will be developed to afford versatile NIR&#8208;II PA platforms for designing a wide variety activatable NIR&#8208;II PA probes as biomedical tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Encapsulated by an Oxygen&#8208;Saturated TiO2 Overlayer for Low&#8208;Temperature SO2&#8208;Tolerant Catalysis during CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real&#8208;working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide&#8208;metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO2, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non&#8208;classical oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra&#8208;small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21 vol% O2 and 10 vol% H2O). In particular, the core (Pd)&#8211;shell (TiO2) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO2 poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120 &#176;C for 240 h (at 100 ppm SO2 and 10 vol% H2O). The stability of this new OMI catalyst was explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that interfacial oxygen atoms at Pd&#8211;O&#8211;Ti sites (of oxygen&#8208;saturated overlayers) serve as non&#8208;metal active sites for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, and change the SO2 adsorption from metal(d)&#8208;to&#8208;SO2(&#960;*) back&#8208;bonding to much weaker &#963;(Ti&#8211;S) bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of an Antiviral Cinnamoylphloroglucinol Collection from Cleistocalyx operculatus: A Synthesis Strategy Based on Biogenetic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthesis strategy based on biogenetic building blocks for the collective and divergent biomimetic syntheses of cleistoperlones A&#8211;F (1&#8211;6), a cinnamoylphloroglucinol collection discovered from Cleistocalyx operculatus, has been developed.

         <title>Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Tuning the Electronic State of Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking were synthesized as heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Without changing the coordination environments or the supramolecular structures, the spin and charge density of the Cu sites were tuned by modulating terminal ligands, resulting in an increased rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal sites is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, we show that modulation of the electronic states of Cu sites, without changing the coordination environments, of two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve photocatalytic activity. The use of these heterogeneous photocatalysts, without using noble metal cocatalysts, resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production rate from 522 to 3620&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. A systematical analysis revealed that the charge density and spin density of the metal centers are efficiently modulated via the modulation of the coordination fields around active copper (II) centers by the variation of the non&#8208;coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight into the electronic state of active metal centers for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Effect Enabled by Ligand Substitution and CO2 Affinity in a Flexible SIFSIX Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linker engineering of a flexible SiF62&#8722; (SIFSIX) pillared network via single atom substitution profoundly changes the sorption behavior and affords a kinetically stable shape&#8208;memory material. The &#8216;memorized&#8217; open phase efficiently purifies a CO2/N2 (15/85) mixture in a manner which would be infeasible for the nonporous variant.







Abstract
We report that linker ligand substitution involving just one atom induces a shape&#8208;memory effect in a flexible coordination network. Specifically, whereas SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;Cu, [Cu(SiF6)(L)2]n, (L=1,4&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene, SiF62&#8722;=SIFSIX) has been previously reported to exhibit reversible switching between closed and open phases, the activated phase of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, [Cu(SiF6)(LN)2]n (LN=2,5&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)pyridine), transformed to a kinetically stable porous phase with strong affinity for CO2. As&#8208;synthesized SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, &#945;, transformed to less open, &#947;, and closed, &#946;, phases during activation. &#946; did not adsorb N2 (77&#8197;K), rather it reverted to &#945; induced by CO2 at 195, 273 and 298&#8197;K. CO2 desorption resulted in &#945;&#8242;, a shape&#8208;memory phase which subsequently exhibited type&#8208;I isotherms for N2 (77&#8197;K) and CO2 as well as strong performance for separation of CO2/N2 (15/85) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar driven by strong binding (Qst=45&#8211;51&#8197;kJ/mol) and excellent CO2/N2 selectivity (up to 700). Interestingly, &#945;&#8242; reverted to &#946; after re&#8208;solvation/desolvation. Molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the properties of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN.

         <title>Living Alternating Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Copolymerization of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran to Provide Completely Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the DHF copolymers with enhanced alternating ratios and degradability. By carefully tuning the ROMP reactivities of comonomers and Ru initiators, we achieved an outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%), while preserving the benefits of living polymerization. The superior degradability of our copolymers was also demonstrated by the notable NMR yield of the unimeric degradation products (up to 80&#8201;%) and recovery ratio (66&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli&#8208;responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive endo&#8208;tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca&#8208;3,9&#8208;dienes (TDs) and endo&#8208;oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior&#8197;A, B&#8208;alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9&#8197;kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24&#8197;hours of degradation, up to 80&#8201;% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66&#8201;% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Deubiquitinase (DUB) Small&#8208;Molecule Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Broad Spectrum DUB Activity Profiling in Living Cells
</title>

         <dc:description>
IMP&#8208;2373 is the first activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) that captures the activity of a large portion of the &#8220;DUBome&#8221; across multiple deubiquitinase (DUB) sub&#8208;classes with limited off&#8208;target effects in living cells, providing a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs, which function only in lysates. IMP&#8208;2373 enables researchers to profile DUB inhibitors target engagement and selectivity in cells, and to understand DUB activity in disease&#8208;relevant systems.







Abstract
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates, often leading to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto&#8208;inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin&#8208;derived covalent activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe IMP&#8208;2373 (12) as a small molecule pan&#8208;DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that IMP&#8208;2373 quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non&#8208;toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. IMP&#8208;2373 thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes.

Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto-inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin-derived covalent activity-based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe &lt;b&gt;IMP-2373&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;) as a small molecule pan-DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that &lt;b&gt;IMP-2373&lt;/b&gt; quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non-toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. &lt;b&gt;IMP-2373&lt;/b&gt; thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease-relevant phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Recyclable and Tough Elastic Vitrimers from a Defined Polydimethylsiloxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel network design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers, and a series of physical analysis is performed to provide a deep structure&#8208;property understanding for the excellent performance of the defined&#8208;network vitrimers.







Abstract
Despite intensive research on sustainable elastomers, achieving elastic vitrimers with significantly improved mechanical properties and recyclability remains a scientific challenge. Herein, inspired by the classical elasticity theory, we present a design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers with a defined network constructed by chemically crosslinking the pre&#8208;synthesized disulfide&#8208;containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains with tetra&#8208;arm polyethylene glycol (PEG). The defined network is achieved by the reduced dangling short chains and the relatively uniform molecular weight of network strands. Such elastic vitrimers with the defined network, i.e., PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D, exhibit significantly improved mechanical performance than random analogous, previously reported PDMS vitrimers, and even commercial silicone&#8208;based thermosets. Moreover, unlike the vitrimers with random network that show obvious loss in mechanical properties after recycling, those with the defined network enable excellent thermal recyclability. The PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D also deliver comparable electrochemical signals if utilized as substrates for electromyography sensors after the recycling. The multiple relaxation processes are revealed via a unique physical approach. Multiple techniques are also applied to unravel the microscopic mechanism of the excellent mechanical performance and recyclability of such defined network.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;linked Iron&#8208;coordinated Tetrapyrrole Conjugated Organic Polymer Catalyst with Spatially Proximate Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs for Oxygen Reduction in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially proximate electron donor&#8208;acceptor pairs are integrated into conjugated organic polymers, which enables fine tailoring of iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (FePr) active sites at the molecular level. The innovative catalyst endows FePr sites with a covalently bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and a highly dense distribution, leading to unprecedented performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated iron (Fe&#8722;N4) materials represent the most promising non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular&#8208;level structure design of Fe&#8722;N4 electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8722;N4 conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8722;N4 structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron&#8208;pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent&#8208;bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine&#8208;linked iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8722;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.933 V and negligible activity decay after 40,000&#8197;cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8722;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of &#8776;210&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8722;N4 catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.

         <title>Synthesizing Interpenetrated Triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an environmentally&#8208;friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from CO2 molecules as a precursor. Two&#8208;step reactions using NaBH4, piperazine and melamine with CO2 provided high crystalline structure. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure showing 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of BET surface area and structural integrity. This structure transforms to high proton conductor upon post&#8208;modification reaction with Oxone.







Abstract
Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3&#8201;%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6&#8197;M HCl), base (6&#8197;M NaOH), and boiling water over 24&#8197;hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 95&#8201;% of relative humidity.

         <title>Structures, Bonding Analyses and Reactivity of a Dicationic Digallene and Diindene Mimicking trans&#8208;bent Ditetrylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of group 13 compounds featuring the first cationic, trans&#8208;bent double bonded digallene and diindene with the bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane ligand is reported. Their bonding situations are extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations and compared to that in isoelectronic, neutral digermenes and distannenes. Several oxidative addition reactions to the digallene were studied.







Abstract
The reaction of bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane (dcpe) and the subvalent MI sources [MI(PhF)2][pf] (M=Ga+, In+; [pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3) yielded the salts [{M(dcpe)}2][pf]2, containing the first dicationic, trans&#8208;bent digallene and diindene structures reported so far. The non&#8208;classical MI&#8646;MI double bonds are surprisingly short and display a ditetrylene&#8208;like structure. The bonding situation was extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with the combination of Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence) analyses and is compared to that in the isoelectronic and isostructural, but neutral digermenes and distannenes. The dissolved [{Ga(dcpe)}2]2+([pf]&#8722;)2 readily reacts with 1&#8208;hexene, cyclooctyne, diphenyldisulfide, diphenylphosphine and under mild conditions at room temperature. This reactivity is analyzed and rationalized.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Zinc Sites with Synergetic Multiple Coordination Shells for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety modulated with S species in higher coordination shells is obtained by a general two&#8208;step strategy. The synergy between the nearest N2O2 coordination and S atoms in the second coordination shell leads to robust Zn sites with optimized electronic structure and nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate. The Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance.







Abstract
Precise manipulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), particularly the simultaneous engineering of multiple coordination shells, is crucial to maximize their catalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, we present a general two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a series of hollow carbon&#8208;based SACs featuring asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moieties simultaneously modulated with S atoms in higher coordination shells of Zn centers (n&#8805;2; designated as Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S). Systematic analyses demonstrate that the synergetic effects between the N2O2 species in the first coordination shell and the S atoms in higher coordination shells lead to robust discrete Zn sites with the optimal electronic structure for selective O2 reduction to H2O2. Remarkably, the Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety with S atoms in the second coordination shell possesses a nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate, which favors the formation and desorption of OOH* on Zn sites for H2O2 generation. Consequently, the Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S SAC exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance with high selectivity of 96&#8201;%. Even at a high current density of 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell, it shows a high H2O2 production rate of 6.924&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an average Faradaic efficiency of 93.1&#8201;%, and excellent durability over 65&#8197;h.

         <title>Is &#8220;Water in Salt&#8221; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the use of highly concentrated electrolytes has become a popular approach to stabilize electrodes in aqueous environments, we demonstrated in this paper that diluted electrolytes can also be effectively used. By appropriate selection of chaotropic anions, we show that the performance of PTCDA electrodes can be substantially improved and maintain excellent stability even at extremely diluted solutions.







Abstract
The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes concept to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has spurred extensive research efforts toward development of improved aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Detection of Large&#8208;Scale Reorientations of Transmembrane Helices During Influenza A M2 Channel Opening
</title>

         <dc:description>
Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play essential roles during viral infections. Using surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy we track and quantify the large&#8208;scale structural changes during opening of the Influenza A viroporin, the M2 proton channel, in a model membrane. This motion is blocked by inhibition providing a clear spectroscopic strategy to explore mechanisms of viroporin function and test new antiviral drugs.







Abstract
Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.

         <title>Mixed Valence BN&#8208;Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structures and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open&#8208;shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN&#8208;doped corannulene radical cations [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8226;&#8226;2+&#8226;2[BArylF4]&#8208; and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8226;&#8226;2+&#8226;2[BArylF4]&#8208; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]&#8208; anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;&#8208;stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self&#8208;assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of forbidden transition (&#916;ms = &#177; 2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;&#8208;trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species. Variable&#8208;temperature EPR and conductivity measurements suggested that the BN&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;trimers exhibited antiferromagnetic coupling and conductivity properties</dc:description>

These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]- anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN-Cor1]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ and [BN-Cor2]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;-stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self-assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of forbidden transition (&#916;ms = &#177; 2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;-trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species. Variable-temperature EPR and conductivity measurements suggested that the BN-doped &#960;-trimers exhibited antiferromagnetic coupling and conductivity properties&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorus:&#160; Thiolate Exchange Cascades with Higher Phosphorothioates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce phosphorus, a pnictogen, as an exchange center for dynamic covalent chemistry.&#160; Cascade exchange of neutral phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates with thiolates is demonstrated in organic solvents, aqueous micellar systems, and in living cells.&#160; Exchange rates increase with pH, electrophilicity of the exchange center and nucleophilicity of the exchangers.&#160; Molecular walking of the dynamic phosphorus along Hammett gradients is simulated by the sequential addition of thiolate exchangers.&#160; Compared to phosphorotrithioates, tetrathioates are better electrophiles with higher exchange rates.&#160; Dynamic phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates are non&#8208;toxic to HeLa Kyoto cells and participate in the dynamic networks that account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake into living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein&#8208;Based Nanomedicine to Silence SOCS1 in Tumor Microenvironment and Trigger Antitumor Immunity against Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrate that suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is associated with the GBM&#8208;associated immunosuppression and develop a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silences SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggers strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was functioned with a siRNA, a peptide vaccine, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. In vivo, the nanomedicine concentrated on the TME, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for improving the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Binary Silicon&#8208;Centered Organoboron Catalyst with Superior Performance to That of Its Bifunctional Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reported a silicon&#8208;centered alkyl borane /ammonium salt binary (two&#8208;component) catalyst exhibits much higher activity than its bifunctional analogue (one&#8208;component) for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide, showing 7.3 times the activity of its bifunctional analogue at a low catalyst loading of 0.01 mol%, and even 15.3 times at an extremely low loading of 0.002 mol%. Via 19F NMR, control experiments, and theoretical calculation, we discovered that the central silicon atom displays appropriate electron density and a larger intramolecular cavity, which is useful to co&#8208;activate the monomer and to deliver propagating chains, thus leading to a better intramolecular synergic effect than its bifunctional analogue. A unique two&#8208;pathway initiation mode was proposed to explain the unusual high activity for the binary catalytic system. This study breaks the traditional impression of the binary Lewis acid/nucleophilic catalyst with poor activity due to the increase in entropy.</dc:description>

         <title>Green ether electrolytes for sustainable high&#8208;voltage potassium ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs. Here, we report a green ether solvent through a rational design of carbon&#8208;chain regulation to elicit steric hindrance, such a structure significantly reducing the solvent's biotoxicity and tuning the solvation structure of electrolytes. Notably, our solvent design is versatile, and an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is favored, facilitating a stable interphase formation on both the anode and cathode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, the green ether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates excellent compatibility with K metal and graphite anode and a 4.2 V high&#8208;voltage cathode (200 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.64%). This work points to a promising path toward the molecular design of green ether&#8208;based electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Chelating Aziridines and Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) from Pyridyl&#8208;Tethered Robust Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl&#8208;tethered robust azomethine ylide thermally rearranges to a chelating cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) by the mediacy of CuCl in an intriguing fashion. However, without the CuCl, it cyclizes to a chelating aziridine. Both are bidentate ligands giving cationic Rh(I) complexes that are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation. The aziridine&#8208;based catalyst was surprisingly found to show superior reactivity.







Abstract
Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N&#8208;heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A pyridyl-tethered robust azomethine ylide thermally rearranges to a chelating cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) by the mediacy of CuCl in an intriguing fashion. However, without the CuCl, it cyclizes to a chelating aziridine. Both are bidentate ligands giving cationic Rh&lt;sup&gt;(I)&lt;/sup&gt; complexes that are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation. The aziridine-based catalyst was surprisingly found to show superior reactivity.

         <title>Structure and Function of the &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation Bimodule of the Mupirocin Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important polyketide antibiotic bearing a 6&#8208;hydroxy group that is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, authentic synthetic substrates and mass spectrometry were used to establish the mechanistic steps governing incorporation of this key 6&#8208;hydroxy group by an &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule that recruits a trans acting monooxygenase, MupA.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by a trans&#8208;AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in Pseudomonas fluorescens. The major bioactive metabolite, pseudomonic acid A (PA&#8722;A), is assembled on a tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) core incorporating a 6&#8208;hydroxy group proposed to be introduced by &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound polyketide chain. Herein, we describe an in vitro approach combining purified enzyme components, chemical synthesis, isotopic labelling, mass spectrometry and NMR in conjunction with in vivo studies leading to the first characterisation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway. These studies reveal the precise timing of hydroxylation by MupA, substrate specificity and the ACP dependency of the enzyme components that comprise this &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule. Furthermore, using purified enzyme, it is shown that the MmpA KS0 shows relaxed substrate specificity, suggesting precise spatiotemporal control of in trans MupA recruitment in the context of the PKS. Finally, the detection of multiple intermodular MupA/ACP interactions suggests these bimodules may integrate MupA into their assembly.

         <title>Stereospecific Aminative Cyclizations Triggered by Intermolecular Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under acidic reaction conditions (TFA), deprotection of BocNR(OSO2R) reagents triggers intermolecular aminative cyclizations of alkenes equipped with pendant nucleophiles. The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by the pendant nucleophile. The method offers broad scope with respect to the nucleophile (N&#8208;, O&#8208; or C&#8208;based), alkene and cyclization mode, allowing the installation of two contiguous stereocenters under operationally simple conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahedraphene: A Csp3&#8208;centered 3D Molecular Nanographene Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 3D tetrakis(hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenyl)methane, &#8220;tetrahedraphene&#8221;, is reported. This molecular nanographene constituted by four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) units attached to a central sp3 carbon atom, shows a highly symmetric arrangement of the HBC units disposed in the apex of a tetrahedron. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals a tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule and the packing in the crystal is achieved mostly by CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions since the interstitial solvent molecules prevent the &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. In solution, tetrahedraphene shows the same electrochemical and photophysical properties as the hexa&#8208;tBu&#8208;substituted HBC (tBu&#8208;HBC) molecule. However, upon water addition, it undergoes a fluorescence change in solution and in the precipitated solid, showing an aggregation induced emission (AIE) process, probably derived from the restriction in the rotation and/or vibration of the HBCs. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations reveal that upon aggregation, the high energy region of the emission band decreases in intensity, whereas the intensity of the red edge emission signal increases and presents a smoother decay, compared to the non&#8208;aggregated molecule. All in all, the excellent correlation between our simulations and the experimental findings allows explaining the colour change observed in the different solutions upon increasing the water fraction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mining of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus resulted in the identification of the hexacyclic sesterterpene subrutilane, besides eight pentacyclic side products. Subrutilane represents the first case of a saturated sesterterpene hydrocarbon. Its structure including the absolute configuration was unambiguously determined through X&#8208;ray analysis and stereoselective deuteration. The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)&#8208;GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP and (2Z,7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP with a blocked reactivity in the C6&#8208;C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)&#8208;GFPP and the saturated substrate analogs were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Diarylamines through a Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diarylation and skeletal diversification of unstrained cyclic amines was exploited to expand and modify the favorable properties of this important substrate class with pivotal roles in drug discovery. Cyclic amines were employed in the synthesis of a novel class of amino&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts, which were converted to highly functionalized diarylamines through an atom&#8208;efficient one&#8208;pot N&#8208;arylation/ ring opening reaction with external nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds through in situ formation of a diarylammonium intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic ring opening by cleavage of the strong C&#8208;N bond. A wide variety of diarylamines was obtained through introduction of two different aryl groups of varied electronics, and the retained iodo&#8208;substituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group tolerance, and the strategy proved efficient also in in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Glycan&#8208;Binding Protein Recognition Using a Fluorinated Azido&#8208;Coumarin Fucoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycan recognition by glycan&#8208;binding proteins is central to the biology of all living organisms. The efficient capture and characterization of relatively weak non&#8208;covalent interactions remains an important challenge in various fields of research. Photoaffinity labeling strategies can create covalent bonds between interacting partners, and photoactive scaffolds such as benzophenone, diazirines and aryl azides have proved widely useful. Since their first introduction, relatively few improvements have been advanced and products of photoaffinity labeling remain difficult to detect. We report a fluorinated azido&#8208;coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan&#8208;protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non&#8208;covalent binding events.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability Investigations on a Pt@HGS Catalyst as a Model Material for Fuel Cell Applications: The Role of the Local pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the resistance of catalysts against electroche&#173;mical degradation is one of the key requirements for the wider use of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Here, we study the degradation of one entity of a highly stable catalyst, Pt@HGS, on a nanoelectrode under accelerated mass transport conditions. We find that the catalyst degrades more rapidly than expected based on previous ensemble measurements. Corroborated by identical location transmission electron microscopy and catalyst layer experiments, we deduce that locally different pH values are likely the reason for this difference in stability. Ultimately, this work provides insights into the actual conditions present in a PEMFC and raises questions about the applicability of accelerated stress tests usually performed to evaluate catalyst stability, particularly when they are performed in half&#8208;cell setups under inert gas.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides comprising endocyclic organic fragments, &#8220;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides&#8221;, can be probes for perturbing protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs).&#160; Finding loop mimics is difficult because of high conformational variability amongst targets.&#160; Backbone Matching (BM), introduced here, helps solve this problem in the illustrative cases by facilitating efficient evaluation of virtual cyclo&#8208;organopeptide core&#8208;structure libraries.&#160; Thus, 86 rigid organic fragments were selected to build a library of 602 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides comprising Ala and organic parts: &#8220;cyclo&#8208;{&#8208;(Ala)n&#8208;organo&#8208;}&#8221;. &#160;The central hypothesis is &#8220;hit&#8221; library members have accessible low energy conformers corresponding to backbone structures of target protein loops, while library members which cannot attain this conformation are probably unworthy of further evaluation.&#160; BM thereby prioritizes candidate loop mimics, so that less than 10 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides are needed to be prepared to find leads for two illustrative PPIs: iNOS&#8226;SPSB2, and uPA&#8226;uPAR.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enabled Asymmetric Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Chiral Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes remains a formidable challenge, presumably due to the lack of rational design of substrates, right choice of reactions together with highly effective catalysis systems. Herein, we disclosed an efficient and practical DKR&#8208;involving (dynamic kinetic resolution) cascade strategy toward synthesizing a novel family of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. The sequential process of PPS&#8208;catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael attack and copper salt&#8208;facilitated aromatization led to the formation of unprecedented phosphorus&#8208;containing oxa[5]helicene scaffolds. A wide variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups were compatible with this protocol, furnishing the expected helical compounds in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. Additionally, the helical products could be conveniently elaborated to promising phosphine ligands with perfectly retained helical chirality, which turned out to be highly efficient chiral ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. These findings not only expand the current library of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes but also offer insights to explore other challenging scaffolds with molecular chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Intercalation/De&#8208;intercalation Chemistry in Phenazine&#8208;based Anode for Hydronium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydronium&#8208;ion batteries have received significant attention owing to the merits of extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, achieving high&#8208;performance hydronium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the inferior properties of anode materials in strong acid electrolyte. Herein, a hydronium&#8208;ion battery is constructed which is based on a diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) anode and a MnO2@graphite felt cathode in a hybrid acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of hydronium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction into HATN electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. This battery exhibits an excellent rate performance (266 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1, 97 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 A g&#8208;1), attractive energy density (182.1 Wh kg&#8208;1) and power density (31.2 kW kg&#8208;1), along with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These results shed light on the development of advanced hydronium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Sialyl Lewisa Antigen and the Effective Anticancer Activity of Its Bacteriophage Q&#946; Conjugate as an Anticancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl Lewisa is an attractive carbohydrate&#8208;associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewisa based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewisa tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti&#8208;sialyl Lewisa IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.







Abstract
Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also known as cancer antigen 19&#8208;9 (CA19&#8208;9), is a tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLea on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, sLea&#8208;based anticancer vaccines have been under&#8208;explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLea with an amine&#8208;bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage, Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;sLea conjugate generated strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;sLea IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLea with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;&#8208;sLea were highly selective toward the sLea structure, could bind strongly with sLea&#8208;expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells through complement&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;&#8208;sLea significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLea&#8208;based vaccine, thus highlighting the significant potential of sLea as a promising cancer antigen.

&lt;p&gt;Sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; is an attractive carbohydrate-associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti-sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;), also known as cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), is a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;-based anticancer vaccines have been under-explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; with an amine-bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage, Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;-sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; conjugate generated strong and long-lasting anti-sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;-sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; were highly selective toward the sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; structure, could bind strongly with sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;-expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells through complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;-sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;-based vaccine, thus highlighting the significant potential of sLe&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; as a promising cancer antigen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative Determination of Water in Organic Liquids by Ambient Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace water monitoring in complex mixtures using mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed. A charge labelled electrophile functions as a mass tag to specifically capture water from the mixture. Dynamic monitoring of water content in levitated droplets and in chemical reaction mixtures facilitates mechanistic investigations of processes involving water.







Abstract
This study uses a rapid tandem mass&#8208;spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace&#8208;water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8211;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge&#8208;labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge&#8208;labelled molecule (N&#8208;methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass&#8208;measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001&#8201;% (10&#8197;ppm) to 99&#8201;%, with better than 10&#8201;% relative standard deviation, along with short (1&#8197;min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#956;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, for example, deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, for example, organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Dispersion Photopolymerization of Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene can be photopolymerized in dispersion using visible light and an optimized photo&#8208;initiating system, overcoming light scattering by the growing objects. Stable latexes with particle diameters up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m were obtained using poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer. This represents a fourfold increase in the largest particle size ever reached by a photochemical process in a dispersed medium.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) particles were synthesized in ethanol/water mixture by dispersion polymerization using visible light irradiation, with either a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene borane&#8208;based photoinitiating system (PIS) or a disulfide. With the full PIS and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizer, the size distributions were broad and the amount of PEGMA had a strong impact on the experiment reproducibility. The addition of a base solved the problem, leading to faster polymerizations, narrower size distributions and larger particles. With the disulfide as sole PIS, bigger and narrowly distributed PS particles were again formed. Quantitative conversion was achieved in each system, with particle size ranging between 100 and 350&#8197;nm. The use of poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer led to significantly larger particles, up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m, with narrow size distributions. The production of such large latex particles by photoinitiated polymerizations is unprecedented.

         <title>Activity And Stability of Single&#8208; And Di&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the O2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational screening method to identify single&#8208; and di&#8208;atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction with metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces is presented. We have performed a three&#8208;step screening study to explore the structural stability, catalytic activity, and electrochemical stability of the catalysts using first&#8208;principles simulations.







Abstract
Efficient and inexpensive catalysts for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) are needed for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. In this study, we designed a computational catalyst&#8208;screening method to identify single and di&#8208;atom metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces for the ORR. Based on formation&#8208;energy calculations and micro&#8208;kinetic modelling of reaction pathways using intermediate binding free energies, we have identified four potentially interesting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and fifteen di&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with relatively high estimated catalytic activity at 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE. Among the best SACs, MnNC shows high stability in both acidic and alkaline media according to our model. For the DACs, we found four possible candidates, MnMn, FeFe, CoCo, and MnNi doped on quad&#8208;atom vacancy sites having considerable stability over a wide pH range. The remaining SACs and DACs with high activity are either less stable or show a stability region at an alkaline pH.

         <title>Isomer Effect on Energy Storage of &#960;&#8208;Extended S&#8208;Shaped Double[6]Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene of thienothiophene core fused with two hexabenzocoronene units exhibits excellent performance as an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery. The isomer (PP and MM) with more interlayer distance exhibited a high lithium storage capability compared to the other isomer and racemic mixture. Helical nanographene anodes display excellent rate capability, superior long&#8208;term cycling performance, and recyclability.







Abstract
Recently, chiral and nonplanar cutouts of graphene have been the favorites due to their unique optical, electronic, and redox properties and high solubility compared with their planar counterparts. Despite the remarkable progress in helicenes, &#960;&#8208;extended heterohelicenes have not been widely explored. As an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the racemic mixture of &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene containing thienothiophene core exhibited a high lithium storage capability, attaining a specific capacity of 424&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent rate capability and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance over 6000&#8197;cycles with negligible fade. As a first report, the &#960;&#8208;extended helicene isomer (PP and MM), with the more interlayer distance that helps faster diffusion of ions, has exhibited a high capacity of 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with long&#8208;term cycling performance over 1500&#8197;cycles compared to the less performing MP and PM isomer and racemic mixture (150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). As supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, a unique molecular design of nanographenes with a fixed (helical) molecular geometry, avoiding restacking of the layers, renders better performance as an anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Interestingly, the recycled nanographene anode material displayed comparable performance.

         <title>Stabilization Of The CN35&#8722; Anion In Recoverable High&#8208;pressure Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) Oxoguanidinates</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of recoverable Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The first stabilization of CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine&#8212;was achieved.







Abstract
A series of isostructural Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The crystal structure of this novel class of compounds was determined via synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) as well as corroborated by X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ln3O2(CN3) solids are composed of the hitherto unknown CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine. Changes in unit cell volumes and compressibility of Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) compounds are found to be dictated by the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. Decompression experiments show that Ln3O2(CN3) compounds are recoverable to ambient conditions. The stabilization of the CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion at ambient conditions provides new opportunities in inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Escape from Hydrofunctionalization: Palladium Hydride&#8208;Enabled Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes and Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of dienes and enynes is reported. This mild protocol harnesses visible light to enhance the hydricity of PdH species, enabling a chemoselectivity switch of the hydropalladation step. This method allows for annulation of dienes and enynes with abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans.







Abstract
Palladium hydrides are traditionally employed in hydrofunctionalization (i.e. monofunctionalization) of conjugated dienes and enynes, owning to its facile protic hydropalladation of electron&#8208;rich (or neutral) unsaturated bonds. Herein, we report a mild PdH&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of conjugated dienes and enynes. This protocol is enabled by the chemoselectivity switch of the initial hydropalladation step achieved by visible light enhancement of hydricity of PdH species. This method allows for cascade annulation of dienes and enynes with various easily available and abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward a wide range of alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans. This protocol also provides an easy access to complex spiro&#8208;fused tricyclic frameworks.

         <title>From Biomimicking to Bioinspired Design of Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction to C1 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;inspired chemical engineering (NICE) approach for the design of nature&#8208;inspired electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to C1 products is presented in this Minireview.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is a promising approach to maintain a carbon cycle balance and produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, CO2RR technology is far from mature, since the conventional CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from low activity (leading to currents &lt;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell), stability (&lt;120&#8197;h), and selectivity. Hence, they cannot meet the requirements for commercial applications (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, &gt;8000&#8197;h, &gt;90&#8201;% selectivity). Significant improvements are possible by taking inspiration from nature, considering biological organisms that efficiently catalyze the CO2 to various products. In this minireview, we present recent examples of enzyme&#8208;inspired and enzyme&#8208;mimicking CO2RR electrocatalysts enabling the production of C1 products with high faradaic efficiency (FE). At present, these designs do not typically follow a methodical approach, but rather focus on isolated features of biological systems. To achieve disruptive change, we advocate a systematic design methodology that leverages fundamental mechanisms associated with desired properties in nature and adapts them to the context of engineering applications.

         <title>Delocalized Isoelectronic Heterostructured FeCoOxSy Catalysts with Tunable Electron Density for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delocalized isoelectronic heterojunction catalyst (DIHC) is constructed by substituting isoelectronic S for O to further complement the heterojunction theory. With the formation of the more catalytic sites in the DIHC, the catalytic behaviors at the heterojunction interface are regulated to realize the continuous capture&#8212;adsorption&#8212;catalysis of Li2Sn, thus improving the sulfur reaction kinetics and performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
High interconversion energy barriers, depressive reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and sluggish Li+ transport inhibit the wide development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, differing from random mixture of selected catalysts, the composite catalyst with outer delocalized isoelectronic heterostructure (DIHC) is proposed and optimized, enhancing the catalytic efficiency for decreasing related energy barriers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;content, the FeCoOxSy composites with different degrees of sulfurization are fabricated by regulating atoms ratio between O and S. The relationship of catalytic efficiency and principal mechanism in DIHCs are deeply understood from electrochemical experiments to in situ/operando spectral spectroscopies i.e., Raman, XRD and UV/Vis. Consequently, the polysulfide conversion and Li2S precipitation/dissolution experiments strongly demonstrate the volcano&#8208;like catalytic efficiency of various DIHCs. Furthermore, the FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell delivers the high performance (1413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Under the low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, the high loading cell stabilizes the areal capacity of 6.67&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Impressively, even resting for about 17&#8197;days for possible polysulfide shuttling, the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell stabilizes the same capacity, showing the practical application of the DIHCs in improving catalytic efficiency and reaching high electrochemical performance.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Bulky Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline materials in which a bulky iptycene derivative (pentiptycene) exhibits rotational dynamics in the solid state is reported by Hajime Ito, Mingoo Jin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309694). It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of crystalline materials in which a bulky iptycene derivative (pentiptycene) exhibits rotational dynamics in the solid state is reported by Hajime Ito, Mingoo Jin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202309694"&gt;e202309694&lt;/a&gt;). It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable the further design of systems in which large and complex molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.

         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Stokes fluorescence lifetime imaging in living cells was demonstrated by Rachel C. Evans et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202308602). This was achieved through the design of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle probes based on triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells suggest that the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.

The synthesis of new molecules and materials does not always involve creating bonds.&#160;In their Research Article (e202310354), Jorge Albalad, Inhar Imaz, Daniel Maspoch et&#8197;al. show how bond scission becomes a powerful synthetic tool to design new molecules and materials when the cleavage step is quantitative, selective, and carefully controlled. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, unprecedented Rh(II)&#8208;based architectures (clusters, a crown, and a macrocycle) were obtained through the retrosynthetic disassembly of metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) via Clip&#8208;off Chemistry.

         <title>Reaction Chemistry at Discrete Organometallic Fragments on Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Black phosphorus (bP) is a two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals material unique in its potential to serve as a support for single&#8208;site catalysts due to its similarity to molecular phosphines, ligands quintessential in homogeneous catalysis. However, there is scarcity of synthetic methods to install single metal centers on the bP lattice. Here we demonstrate the functionalization of bP nanosheets with molecular Re and Mo complexes. A suite of characterization techniques, including infrared, X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as scanning tunneling electron microscopy corroborate that the functionalized nanosheets contain a high density of discrete metal centers directly bound to the bP surface. Moreover, the supported metal centers are chemically accessible and can undergo ligand exchange transformations without detaching from the surface. The steric and electronic properties of bP as a ligand are estimated with respect to molecular phosphines. Sterically, bP resembles tri(tolyl)phosphine when monodentate to a metal center, and bis(diphenylphosphino)propane when bidentate, whereas electronically bP is a &#963;&#8208;donor as strong as a trialkyl phosphine. This work is foundational in elucidating the nature of black phosphorus as a ligand and underscores the viability of using bP as a basis for single&#8208;site catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic ensembling design of hierarchically ordered FAU&#8208;type zeolite frameworks for vacuum gas oil hydrocracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites hold importance as catalysts and membranes across numerous industrial processes that produce most of the world&#8217;s fuels and chemicals. In zeolite catalysis, the rate of molecular diffusion inside the micropore channels defines the catalyst longevity and selectivity, thereby influencing the catalytic process efficiency. Decreasing the diffusion pathlengths of zeolites to the nanoscopic level by fabricating well&#8208;organized nanoporous architecture can efficiently overcome their intrinsic mass&#8208;transfer limitations without losing hydrothermal stability. We report a rational post&#8208;synthetic design for the synthesis of hierarchically ordered&#160;FAU&#8208;type zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal (P6mm) and 3D&#8208;cubic (Ia[[EQUATION]]d) mesopore channels formed by a post&#8208;synthetic approach. The synthesis involves methodical incision of the parent zeolite into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments by in situ generated base and bulky surfactants. The micellar ensembles formed by these surfactant&#8208;zeolite interactions are subsequently reorganized into various ordered mesophases by tuning the micellar curvature with ion&#8208;specific interactions (Hofmeister effect). Unlike conventional crystallization, which offers poor control over mesophase formation due to kinetic constraints, here, crystalline mesostructures can be developed under dilute, mild alkaline conditions by controlled reassembly. The prepared hierarchically ordered zeolites with nanometric diffusion pathlengths have demonstrated excellent yields of naphtha and middle&#8208;distillates in low&#8208;pressure vacuum gas oil hydrocracking with decreased coke deposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Customization and Regulation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Membrane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy&#8208;efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect&#8208;free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel&#160;microenvironment, and consequently, an&#160;intriguing H2/CO2 separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656~5.4, H2 permeance of 964~2745 gas permeation unit).&#160;Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non&#8208;destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full&#8208;chain demonstration for membrane fabrication&#8208;separation validation&#8208;microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution by Alkynyl Copper Driven Dearomatization and Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric transformations via dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom as the substrates. In this case, the challenging dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of p&#8208;orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate&#8208;dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition metal center can perform as an intriguing type of driving force for dearomatization, which is applied to the development of a novel model for seldomly studied asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5&#8208;H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8211;N axis. Gram&#8208;scale test and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential chemical transformation space of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced [3+2] Cycloaddition of Carbenes and Nitriles: A Versatile Approach to Oxazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a photoinduced protocol for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important oxazole molecules using diazo and nitrile as reactants. The process involves the initial photolysis of diazo to afford singlet carbenes which are tapped by nitriles in a [3+2] cycloaddition fashion to give a library of substituted oxazoles. With di&#8208;nitrile compounds, useful bis&#8208;oxazoles were obtained. The applicability of the present transformation has been showcased through the expedient synthesis of small molecule drugs and biologically relevant molecules viz. felbinac, pimprinine, texamine, ugnenenazole etc. The protocol is also useful for the generation of &#160;2H and 13C isotope labelled oxazoles. A merging photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry have been demonstrated for scaling up the reaction. The non&#8208;requirement of metal catalysis or photosensitizers to harness the light energy with blue light sufficing the execution of the reaction makes it a versatile and general protocol for the synthesis of structurally diverse oxazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Photocatalysts Containing Segregated &#960;&#8208;Conjugation Units with Electron&#8208;Trap Activity for Efficient Natural&#8208;light&#8208;driven Bacterial Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of highly efficient and metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation under natural light is a major challenge in photocatalytic antibiosis. Herein, we developed an acidizing solvent&#8208;thermal approach for inserting a non&#8208;conjugated ethylenediamine segment into the conjugated planes of 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride to generate a photocatalyst containing segregated &#960;&#8208;conjugation units (EDA&#8208;PTCDA). Under natural light, EDA&#8208;PTCDA achieved 99.9% inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (60 and 45 min), which is the highest efficiency among all the natural light antibacterial reports. The difference in the surface potential and excited charge density corroborated the possibility of a built&#8208;in electron&#8208;trap effect of the non&#8208;conjugated segments of EDA&#8208;PTCDA, thus forming a highly active EDA&#8208;PTDA/bacteria interface. In addition, EDA&#8208;PTCDA exhibited negligible toxicity and damage to normal tissue cells. This catalyst provides a new opportunity for photocatalytic antibiosis under natural light conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development of Non&#8208;Invasive Imaging Probes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The last two decades have witnessed a major revolution in the field of tumor immunology including clinical progress using various immunotherapy strategies. These advances have highlighted the potential for approaches that harness the power of the immune system to fight against cancer. While cancer immunotherapies have shown significant clinical successes, patient responses vary widely due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of tumors and immune responses, calling for reliable biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy. Especially, stratifying responding individuals from non&#8208;responders during early stages of treatment could help avoid long&#8208;term damages and tailor personalized treatments. In efforts to develop non&#8208;invasive means for accurately evaluating and predicting tumor response to immunotherapy, multiple affinity&#8208;based agents targeting immune cell markers and checkpoint molecules have been developed and advanced to clinical trials. In addition, researchers have recently turned their attention to substrate and activity&#8208;based imaging probes that can provide real&#8208;time, functional assessment of immune response to treatment. Here, we highlight some of those recently designed probes that image functional proteases as biomarkers of cancer immunotherapy with a focus on their chemical design and detection modalities and discuss challenges and opportunities for the development of imaging tools utilized in cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Gain in Organic Photodetectors Using the Polymer with Singlet Open&#8208;Shell Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodetectors are critical components in intelligent optoelectronic systems, and photomultiplication&#8208;capable devices are essential for detecting weak optical signals. Despite significant advances, developing a photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors with high gain and low noise current simultaneously remains challenging. In this work, a new conjugated polymer PDN with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state is introduced in active layers for electron capture, and the corresponding PDN&#8208;based photodetectors exhibited an enhanced photoelectric gain and decreased dark current density at a low forward bias. At 1.5 V, the PDN&#8208;based ternary photodetector have the external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 2552.3 % and the specific detectivity of 1.4 &#215; 10e14 Jones at 710 nm calculated by the measured noise current, with the gain 22 times higher than that of the control group. This study provides an approach for exploiting polymers with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state to enhance the gain of organic photodetectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Photocatalytic Decaging for Remote&#8208;Controlled Spatiotemporal Activation in Living Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal manipulation of biological processes in living animals using noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled stimuli is a capti&#8208;vating but challenging endeavor. Herein, we present the development of a biocompatible photocatalytic technology termed CAT&#8208;NIR, which uses external near infrared light (NIR, 740 nm) to trigger decaging reactions in living mice. The Os(II) terpyridine complex was identified as an efficient NIR photocatalyst for promoting deboronative hydroxylation reactions via superoxide generation in the presence of NIR light, resulting in the deprotection of phenol groups and the release of bioactive molecules under living conditions. The validation of the CAT&#8208;NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR&#8208;triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins in living cells. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer&#8208;aided screening, CAT&#8208;NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled rescue of drug molecules. Given its broad adaptability, this CAT&#8208;NIR system may open new opportunities for manipulating the functions of bioactive molecules in living animals using external NIR light with spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Energy Transfer and White&#8208;Light Emission in Chirality&#8208;Controlled Crystallization&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Dimensional Co&#8208;assemblies from Donor and Acceptor Dye&#8208;Conjugated Polylactides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving predictable and programmable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures with specific functions from exclusively organic soft materials remains a scientific challenge. This article unravels stereocomplex crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly as a facile method for producing thermally robust discrete 2D&#8208;platelets of diamond shape from degradable semicrystalline polylactide (PLA) scaffolds. The method involves co&#8208;assembling two PLA stereoisomers, namely, PY&#8208;PDLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA, which form stereocomplex (SC)&#8208;crystals in isopropanol. By conjugating a well&#8208;known F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and acceptor dye, namely, pyrene (PY) and naphthalene monoimide (NMI), respectively, to the chain termini of these two interacting stereoisomers, a thermally robust FRET process can be stimulated from the 2D array of the co&#8208;assembled dyes on the thermally resilient SC&#8208;PLA crystal surfaces. Uniquely, by decorating the surface of the SC&#8208;PLA crystals with an externally immobilized guest dye, Rhodamine&#8208;B, similar diamond&#8208;shaped structures could be produced that exhibit pure white&#8208;light emission through a surface&#8208;induced two&#8208;step cascade energy transfer process. The FRET response in these systems displays remarkable dependence on the intrinsic crystalline packing, which could be modulated by the chirality of the co&#8208;assembling PLA chains. This is supported by comparing the properties of similar 2D platelets generated from two homochiral PLLAs (PY&#8208;PLLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA) labeled with the same FRET pair.</dc:description>

         <title>Guaiacol as an Organic Superoxide Dismutase Mimics for Anti&#8208;ageing a Ru&#8208;based Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich layered oxides using oxygen redox as well as transition metal redox suffer from its structural instability due to lattice oxygen escaped from its structure during oxygen redox and the following electrolyte decomposition by the reactive oxygen species. Herein, we rescued a Li&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal by employing an organic superoxide dismutase mimics as a homogeneous electrolyte additive. Guaiacol scavenged superoxide radicals via dismutation or disproportionation to convert two superoxide molecules to peroxide and dioxygen after absorbing lithium superoxide on its partially negative oxygen of methoxy and hydroxyl groups. Additionally, guaiacol was decomposed to form a thin and stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Ag+&#8208;Doped InSe Nanosheets for Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer toward Large&#8208;Current Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is an appealing approach to CO2 utilization through CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) to ethanol at high current density; however, the commonly used Cu&#8208;based catalysts cannot sustain large current during CO2ER despite their capability for ethanol production. Herein, we report that Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets with Se vacancies can address this grand challenge in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the Ag+ doping, which can tailor the electronic structure of InSe while diversifying catalytically active sites, enables the formation of key reaction intermediates and their sequential evolution into ethanol. More importantly, such a material can well work for large&#8208;current conditions in MEA electrolyzers with In2+ species stabilized via electron transfer from Ag to Se. Remarkably, in an MEA electrolyzer by coupling cathodic CO2ER with anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the optimal catalyst exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 68.7% and a partial current density of 186.6 mA cm&#8722;2 on the cathode with a full&#8208;cell ethanol energy efficiency of 26.1% at 3.0 V. This work opens an avenue for large&#8208;current production of ethanol from CO2 with high selectivity and energy efficiency by rationally designing electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Supra&#8208;Cyanines: Ultrabright Cyanine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Materials in Solution and Solid States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent materials with high brightness play a crucial role in the advancement of various technologies such as bioimaging, photonics, and OLEDs. While significant efforts are dedicated to designing new organic dyes with improved performance, enhancing the brightness of existing dyes holds equal importance. In this study, we present a simple supramolecular strategy to develop ultrabright cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent materials by addressing long&#8208;standing challenges associated with cyanine dyes, including undesired cis&#8211;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Supra&#8208;cyanines are obtained by incorporating cyanine moieties in a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, exhibiting high fluorescence quantum yield (up to 50%) in both solution and solid states. These findings offer a versatile approach for constructing highly emissive cyanine&#8208;based supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Performance of Highly Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present a novel approach for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that overcomes the common limitations of non&#8208;scalable solvothermal procedures. Our method allows for the room&#8208;temperature and scalable synthesis of a highly fluorinated DFTAPB&#8208;TFTA&#8208;COF, which exhibits intrinsic hydrophobicity. We used DFT&#8208;based calculations to elucidate the role of the fluorine atoms in enhancing the crystallinity of the material through corrugation effects, resulting in maximized interlayer interactions, as disclosed both from PXRD structural resolution and theoretical simulations. We further investigated the electrocatalytic properties of this material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our results show that the fluorinated COF produces hydrogen peroxide selectively with low overpotential (0.062 V) and high turnover frequency (0.0757 s&#8208;1) without the addition of any conductive additives. These values are among the best reported for non&#8208;pyrolyzed and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Finally, we employed DFT&#8208;based calculations to analyse the reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role of the fluorine atom in the active site assembly. Our findings shed light on the potential of fluorinated COFs as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, as well as their potential applications in other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Catalytic Insight into the Unique Pentacyclic Triterpene Synthase TwOSC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) catalyzed cyclization of the linear substrate (3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;oxidosqualene to diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid (PT) skeletons is one of the most complex reactions in nature. Friedelin has a unique PT skeleton involving a fascinating nine&#8208;step Cation Shuttle&#8208;Run (CSR) cascade arrangement reaction, in which the carbocation formed from C&#8208;2 moves to the other side of the skeleton, runs back to C&#8208;3 to yield a friedelin cation, and finally deprotonated. However, as the data on the crystal structure of plant OSCs are lacking, it remains unknown why the CSR cascade reactions for friedelin biosynthesis and the exact catalytic mechanism of the CSR. In this study, we determined the first cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a plant OSC, friedelin synthase, from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (TwOSC). We also performed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to reveal the energy profile for the CSR cascade reaction and identify key residues crucial for PT skeleton yield. Furthermore, we semi&#8208;rationally designed two TwOSC mutants, which significantly improved the yields of friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin, respectively. Our findings provide novel insights into the CSR mechanism under TwOSC enzyme catalysis and propose a new strategy for the semi&#8208;rational design of other OSCs to promote PT biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Clean Synthetic Strategies to Biologically Active Molecules from Lignin: A Green Path to Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deriving active pharmaceutical agents from renewable resources is crucial to increase the economic feasibility of modern biorefineries and promises to alleviate critical supply&#8208;chain dependencies in pharma manufacturing. At the fundamental level, embracing the structural complexity of renewable resources offers hitherto unexploited opportunities for the green synthesis of essential pharmaceuticals, and opens new avenues in drug discovery. In this vein, our multidisciplinary approach combines research in lignin&#8208;first biorefining, sustainable catalysis, and alternative solvents with bioactivity screening, an in vivo efficacy study, and a structural similarity search. The resulting sustainable path to novel anti&#8208;infective, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anti&#8208;cancer molecules enabled the rapid identification of frontrunners for key therapeutic indications. Most significantly, we discovered an anti&#8208;infective against the priority pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, showing efficacy in vivo and promising plasma&#8208; and metabolic stability. Our established chemocatalytic methods, inspired by the innate structural features of lignin, provide straightforward access to synthetically challenging biologically active molecules of the core dopamine structure, namely tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, 3&#8208;arylindoles and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. Our diverse array of atom&#8208;economic transformations produce only harmless side&#8208;products and use benign reaction media, such as tunable deep eutectic solvents for modulating reactivity in challenging cyclization steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Kinetic C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation for the Synthesis of C&#8208;B Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct C&#8208;H functionalization of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8208;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The direct C-H functionalization of 1,2-benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2-benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C-B axially chiral 2-aryl-1,2-benzazaborines and 3-substituted 2-aryl-1,2-benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354). The synthetic potential of this reaction is showcased by late-stage modification of complex molecules, scale-up reaction, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Densely Packed CO2 Aids Charge, Spin, and Lattice Ordering Partially Fluctuated in a Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partial charge fluctuations in the charge&#8208;ordered state of a material, often triggered by structural disorders and/or defects, can significantly alter its physical characteristics, such as magnetic long&#8208;range ordering. However, it is difficult to post&#8208;chemically fix such accidental partial fluctuations to reconstruct a uniform charge&#8208;ordered state. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;aided charge ordering demonstrated in a CO2&#8208;post&#8208;captured layered magnet, [{Ru2(o&#8208;ClPhCO2)4}2{TCNQ(OMe)2}]&#183;CO2 (1&#8835;CO2; o&#8208;ClPhCO2&#8722; = ortho&#8208;chlorobenzoate; TNCQ(OMe)2 = 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane). Pristine porous layered magnet 1 had a partially charge&#8208;fluctuated ordered state, which provided ferrimagnetic ordering at TC = 65 K. Upon loading CO2, 1 adsorbed one mole of CO2, forming 1&#8835;CO2, and raising TC to 100 K. This was because of the vanishing charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure. This research illustrates the post&#8208;accessible host&#8208;guest chemistry delicately combined with charge, spin, and lattice ordering in a spongy magnet. Furthermore, it highlights how this innovative approach opens up new possibilities for technology and nanoscale magnetism manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Four&#8208;Electron Reduction of Oxygen by a Nonheme Heterobimetallic CuFe Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report&#160;herein the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst ([CuII(bpbp)(&#956;&#8208;OAc)2FeIII]2+, CuFe&#8208;OAc), which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase and can catalyze oxygen reduction to water with a turnover frequency of 2.4 &#215; 103 s&#8208;1 and selectivity of 96.0% in the presence of Et3NH+. This performance significantly outcompetes its homobimetallic analogues (2.7 s&#8208;1 of CuCu&#8208;OAc with %H2O2 selectivity of 98.9%, and inactive of FeFe&#8208;OAc) under the same conditions. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, in combination with density functional theory calculation, show that the CuFe center efficiently mediates O&#8208;O bond cleavage via CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII peroxo intermediate, in which the peroxo ligand possesses distinctive coordinated and electronic characters. Our work sheds light on the nature of Cu/Fe heterobimetallic cooperation in oxygen reduction catalysis and demonstrates the potential of this synergistic effect in the design of nonheme oxygen reduction catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>CO binding energy has been employed as a descriptor in the catalyst design for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR).

         <title>Counting d&#8208;Orbital Vacancies of Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts for the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single electronic&#8208;structure descriptor is proposed by linking the d charge for transition metals to the reaction rate for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). This descriptor provides guidelines for the design of catalysts for the SRR as well as various processes and has great promise for driving lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to practical applications.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) would allow the production of renewable high&#8208;capacity rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries using sustainable and nontoxic elemental sulfur as a cathode material, but its slow reaction rate causes a serious shuttle effect and dramatically reduces the capacity. We found that a catalyst composed of Pd nanoparticles supported by ordered mesoporous carbon (Pd/OMC) had a high reaction rate in the SRR, and a Li&#8208;S battery assembled with this catalyst had a low shuttle constant of 0.031&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;rate performance with a specific capacity of 1527&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C which is close to the theoretical value. The high activity of Pd/OMC with a d&#8208;orbital vacancy of 0.87&#8197;e was predicted from a volcano relationship between the d charge for the metal and the adsorption activation entropy and reaction rate for the SRR by examining Pd, Au, Pt, Rh, and Ru transition&#8208;metal nanocatalysts. The strategy of using a single electronic structure descriptor to design high&#8208;efficiency SRR catalysts has suggested a way to produce practical Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Display Selection of a Hybrid Foldamer&#8211;Peptide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reciprocal stapling of two helices, an aromatic foldamer helix and a peptide &#945;&#8208;helix, was observed in the conformation of a hybrid foldamer&#8211;peptide macrocycle when bound to the protein target against which it was selected. This intriguing shape and the possible contribution of the foldamer to protein binding highlight potential benefits of inserting a foldamer segment in display selection of macrocyclic peptides.







Abstract
Expanding the chemical diversity of peptide macrocycle libraries for display selection is desirable to improve their potential to bind biomolecular targets. We now have implemented a considerable expansion through a large aromatic helical foldamer inclusion. A foldamer was first identified that undergoes flexizyme&#8208;mediated tRNA acylation and that is capable of initiating ribosomal translation with yields sufficiently high to perform an mRNA display selection of macrocyclic foldamer&#8211;peptide hybrids. A hybrid macrocyclic nanomolar binder to the C&#8208;lobe of the E6AP HECT domain was selected that showed a highly converged peptide sequence. A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that both the peptide and foldamer are helical in an intriguing reciprocal stapling fashion. The strong residue convergence could be rationalized based on their involvement in specific interactions with the target protein. The foldamer stabilizes the peptide helix through stapling and through contacts with key residues. These results altogether represent a significant extension of the chemical space amenable to display selection and highlight possible benefits of inserting an aromatic foldamer into a peptide macrocycle for the purpose of protein recognition.

Spin frustration has drawn people's attention for its significance in physics and materials science, especially for quantum spin liquids. Organic radical species show a promising potential in building spin&#8208;frustrated compounds. This Minireview briefly introduces the reported examples of organic radicals that possess spin frustration and summarizes their related data on frustration properties.







Abstract
Spin frustration, which results from geometric frustration and a systematical inability to satisfy all antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between unpaired spins simultaneously, is under the spotlight for its importance in physics and materials science. Spin frustration is treated as the structural basis of quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Featuring flexible chemical structures, organic radical species exhibit great potential in building spin&#8208;frustrated molecules and lattices. So far, the reported examples of spin&#8208;frustrated organic radical compounds include triradicals, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) radicals and derivatives, [Pd(dmit)2] compounds (dmit=1,3&#8208;dithiol&#8208;2&#8208;thione&#8208;4,5&#8208;dithiolate), nitronyl nitroxides, fullerenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other heterocyclic compounds where the spin frustration is generated intra&#8208; or intermolecularly. In this Minireview, we provide a brief summary of the reported radical compounds that possess spin frustration. The related data, including magnetic exchange coupling parameters, spin models, frustration parameters, and crystal lattices, are summarized and discussed.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Plastic Waste Enabled by Plastic&#8208;Catalyst Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer was discovered on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. The construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces by interfacial engineering approaches enables vapor phase depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) at low temperatures with a trace amount of earth abundant metal, Zn.







Abstract
Depolymerization of condensation polymers by chemolysis often suffers from the large usage of solvents and homogeneous catalysts such as acids, bases, and metal salts. The catalytic efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts is largely constrained by the poor interfacial contact between solid catalysts and solid plastics below melting points. We report here our discovery of autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. Inspired by the &#8220;contact mass&#8221; concept in industrial chlorosilane production, we further demonstrate that the construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces enables solvent&#8208;free depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate by vapor phase methanolysis at relatively low temperatures. Trace amounts of earth&#8208;abundant element (zinc) introduced by electrostatic adsorption is sufficient for catalyzing the depolymerization. The concept of plastic&#8208;catalyst contact mass interfacial catalysis might inspire new pathways for tackling plastic waste problems.

         <title>Stabilization and Binding of [V4O12]4&#8722; and Unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722; to Lysozyme upon Loss of Ligands and Oxidation of the Potential Drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2</title>

         <dc:description>
The promising anti&#8208;diabetic and anti&#8208;cancer drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 in the presence of lysozyme undergoes ligand exchange, partial or complete oxidation of VIV to VV to give two polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V4O12]4&#8722; and the unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722;, based on the unusual [V18O46(NO3)]n&#8722; cage. They are stabilized by non&#8208;covalent or covalent interactions with the protein.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution crystal structures of lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 under two different experimental conditions have been solved. The crystallographic study reveals the loss of the ligands, the oxidation of VIV to VV and the subsequent formation of adducts of the protein with two different polyoxidovanadates: [V4O12]4&#8722;, which interacts with lysozyme non&#8208;covalently, and the unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722;, which is covalenty bound to the side chain of an aspartate residue of symmetry related molecules.

         <title>Residual&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Shift&#8208;Anisotropy&#8208;Based Enantiodifferentiation in Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Phases Based on Helically Chiral Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual chemical shift anisotropy can be acquired from enantiomers employing biphasic helically chiral polyacetylene liquid crystal from a single 1D carbon spectrum. The chiral environment of the liquid crystal facilitates diastereomorphous interactions of enantiomers and leads to two different sets of RCSAs. On the basis of two chiral molecules, it has been demonstrated that enantiodiscrimination is feasible







Abstract
Anisotropic NMR spectroscopy, revealing residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and residual chemical shift anisotropies (RCSAs) has emerged as a powerful tool to determine the configurations of synthetic and complex natural compounds. The deduction of the absolute in addition to the relative configuration is one of the primary goals in the field. Therefore, the investigation of the enantiodiscriminating capabilities of chiral alignment media becomes essential. While RDCs and RCSAs are now used for the determination of the relative configuration routinely, RCSAs have not been measured in chiral alignment media such as chiral liquid crystals. Herein, we present this application by measuring RCSAs for chiral analytes such as indanol and isopinocampheol in the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase of an L&#8208;valine derived helically chiral polyacetylenes. We have also demonstrated that a single 1D 13C&#8722;{1H} NMR spectrum suffices to get the RCSAs circumventing the necessity to acquire two spectra at two alignment conditions.

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Precise Detection of the Pulmonary Metastatic Tumors: A Traditional Molecule Having a Stunning Turn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reinventing strategy was exploited to develop an activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (PMT9) for lung tumor&#8208;specific imaging. The obtained PMT9 exhibited ultra&#8208;sensitivity towards tumor metabolic acidity, which makes it exclusively shine in lung tumor lesions rather than normal lung tissues, enabling precise detection of pulmonary metastasis as well as primary lung tumor, with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
An accurate detection of lung metastasis is of great significance for making better treatment choices and improving cancer prognosis, but remains a big challenge in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a reinventing strategy to develop a pH&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoprobe, pulmonary metastasis tracer (denoted as PMT), based on assembly of NIR dye IR780 and calcium phosphate (CaP). By delicately tuning the intermolecular interactions during the assembly process and dye doping content, as well as the synthetic condition of probe, the fluorescence of PMT could be finely adjusted via the tumor acidity&#8208;triggered disassembly. Notably, the selected PMT9 could sharply convert subtle pH variations into a distinct fluorescence signal to generate high fluorescence ON/OFF contrast, dramatically reducing the background signals. Benefiting from such preferable features, PMT9 is able to precisely identify not only the tumor sites in orthotopic lung cancer models but also the pulmonary metastases in mice with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR). This study provides a unique strategy to turn shortcomings of traditional dye IR780 during in vivo imaging into advantages and further expand the application of fluorescent probe to image lung associated tumor lesions.

         <title>Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the incorporation of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes, enabling the synthesis of otherwise unavailable complexes. Attachment of albumin&#8208;targeting maleimide moieties led to increased tumor accumulation and anticancer activity compared to oxaliplatin. The presented strategy will allow the development of new types of targeted multi&#8208;action platinum(IV) complexes.







Abstract
Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OHeq)2(OAcax)2]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long&#8208;circulating tumor&#8208;targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well. The complexes showed massively prolonged plasma half&#8208;life and distinctly improved anticancer activity in vivo compared to oxaliplatin. Taken together, the newly developed synthetic platform allows the simple and specific insertion of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes. This will enable the attachment of three different (bioactive) moieties generating targeted triple&#8208;action platinum(IV) prodrugs within one single platinum complex.

&lt;p&gt;We investigated the incorporation of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes, enabling the synthesis of otherwise unavailable complexes. Attachment of albumin-targeting maleimide moieties led to increased tumor accumulation and anticancer activity compared to oxaliplatin. The presented strategy will allow the development of new types of targeted multi-action platinum(IV) complexes.

         <title>Supramolecular Barrel&#8208;Rosette Ion Channel Based on 3,5&#8208;Diaminobenzoic Acid for Cation&#8208;Anion Symport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid&#8208;based supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette ion channels have been synthesized that possess a distinctive combination of hydrogen&#8208;bond forming and lone&#8208;pair donating groups within the channel cavity. This allows them to function as cation&#8208;anion symporters, with profound selectivity towards KClO4.







Abstract
The structural tropology and functions of natural cation&#8208;anion symporting channels have been continuously investigated due to their crucial role in regulating various physiological functions. To understand the physiological functions of the natural symporter channels, it is vital to develop small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based biomimicking systems that can provide mechanistic insights into the ion&#8208;binding sites and the ion&#8208;translocation pathways. Herein, we report a series of bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid based self&#8208;assembled ion channels with distinctive ion transport ability. Ion transport experiment across the lipid bilayer membrane revealed that compound 1&#8201;b exhibits the highest transport activity among the series, and it has interesting selective co&#8208;transporting functions, i.e., facilitates K+/ClO4&#8722; symport. Electrophysiology experiments confirmed the formation of supramolecular ion channels with an average diameter of 6.2&#177;1&#8197;&#197; and single channel conductance of 57.3&#177;1.9&#8197;pS. Selectivity studies of channel 1&#8201;b in a bilayer lipid membrane demonstrated a permeability ratio of 
, 
, and 
 indicating the higher selectivity of the channel towards KClO4 over KCl salt. A hexameric assembly of a trimeric rosette of 1&#8201;b was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations with different salts to understand the supramolecular channel formation and ion selectivity pattern.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation Engineering the Spin Change of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Cluster Deconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing clusters as secondary building units are firstly realized, in which the clusters can be further removed via the post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
Spin crossover (SCO) materials with new architectures will expand and enrich the research in the SCO field. Here, we report two metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing tetradentate organic ligands and hexatopic linkers [Ag8X8(CN)6]6&#8722; (X=Br and I), which represents the first SCO MOF with clusters as building blocks. The silver halide cluster can be further removed after reacting with lithium tetracyanoquinodimethan (LiTCNQ). Such post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is realized via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation from urk to nbo topology. Accordingly, the spin state and fluorescence properties are greatly modified by cluster deconstruction. Therefore, these achievements will provide new ideas for the design of new SCO systems and the development of PSM methods.

         <title>A GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist for Guiding MOF Discovery
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of using artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;human collaboration to advance reticular chemistry is shown. Through iterative learning, the GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist indicates instructions while evolving based on the feedback from a human researcher. It results in the innovative discovery of a series of isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and suggests an approach for using large language models in experimental scientific research.







Abstract
We present a new framework integrating the AI model GPT&#8208;4 into the iterative process of reticular chemistry experimentation, leveraging a cooperative workflow of interaction between AI and a human researcher. This GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist is an integrated system composed of three phases. Each of these utilizes GPT&#8208;4 in various capacities, wherein GPT&#8208;4 provides detailed instructions for chemical experimentation and the human provides feedback on the experimental outcomes, including both success and failures, for the in&#8208;context learning of AI in the next iteration. This iterative human&#8208;AI interaction enabled GPT&#8208;4 to learn from the outcomes, much like an experienced chemist, by a prompt&#8208;learning strategy. Importantly, the system is based on natural language for both development and operation, eliminating the need for coding skills, and thus, make it accessible to all chemists. Our collaboration with GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist guided the discovery of an isoreticular series of MOFs, with each synthesis fine&#8208;tuned through iterative feedback and expert suggestions. This workflow presents a potential for broader applications in scientific research by harnessing the capability of large language models like GPT&#8208;4 to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of research activities.

         <title>Simultaneous Capture of CO2 Boosting Its Electroreduction in the Micropores of a Metal&#8211;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction occurs in the pores of a porous catalyst possessing CO2 capture sites, which boosts the catalytic performance virtually independent on the CO2 concentration.







Abstract
Integration of CO2 capture capability from simulated flue gas and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) active sites into a catalyst is a promising cost&#8208;effective strategy for carbon neutrality, but is of great difficulty. Herein, combining the mixed gas breakthrough experiments and eCO2RR tests, we showed that an Ag12 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8208;NH2, aka Ag12bpy&#8208;NH2), simultaneously possessing CO2 capture sites as &#8220;CO2 relays&#8221; and eCO2RR active sites, can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2 from simulated flue gas (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;N2=15&#8201;:&#8201;85, at 298&#8197;K), but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2 into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2 conversion of 60&#8201;%. More importantly, its eCO2RR performance (a Faradaic efficiency (CO) of 96&#8201;% with a commercial current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a very low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V for 300&#8197;hours and the full&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 56&#8201;%) under simulated flue gas atmosphere is close to that under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere, and higher than those of all reported catalysts at higher potentials under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere. This work bridges the gap between CO2 enrichment/capture and eCO2RR.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking process is presented herein by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This process is harnessed to develop a novel gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode.







Abstract
The successful realization of gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking reactions, facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis, has been reported for the first time. This breakthrough has led to the development of gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode. The reaction mechanism has been elucidated through comprehensive experimental and computational studies.

         <title>A Bidentate Antimony Pnictogen Bonding Host System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidentate pnictogen&#8208;bonding host system based on Sb(C2F5)2 functions was constructed and its host&#8211;guest chemistry tested towards a variety of substrates including Me2O and its higher homologues, halide ions and N&#8208;heterocyclic bases. The new host system shows cooperativity of the two C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 functions during adduct formation. The complexes were analyzed both experimentally (XRD, NMR) and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA).







Abstract
A bidentate pnictogen bonding host&#8208;system based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene was synthesized by a selective tin&#8208;antimony exchange reaction and investigated regarding its ability to act as a Lewis acidic host component for the complexation of Lewis basic or anionic guests. In this work, the novel C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 unit was established to study the potential of antimony(III) sites as representatives for the scarcely explored pnictogen bonding donors. The capability of this partly fluorinated host system was investigated towards halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;), dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Y (Y=O, S, Se, Te), and nitrogen heterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine). Insights into the adduct formation behavior as well as the bonding situation of such E&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb&#8722;CF moieties were obtained in solution by means of NMR spectroscopy, in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by elemental analyses, and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA), respectively.

         <title>Stabilization of Guanidinate Anions [CN3]5&#8722; in Calcite&#8208;Type SbCN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimony guanidinate SbCN3 was produced in a high&#8208;pressure&#8208;high&#8208;temperature synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. The compound can be produced from elements as well as via a reaction between antimony and cyanuric triazide. This study demonstrates a straightforward route to novel nitridocarbonates. SbCN3 is a direct band gap semiconductor with Eg=2.20&#8197;eV as shown by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;rich phases presents a significant chemical challenge due to the inherent stability of the dinitrogen molecule. This stabilization can be achieved by utilizing strong covalent bonds in complex anions with carbon, such as cyanide CN&#8722; and NCN2&#8722; carbodiimide, while more nitrogen&#8208;rich carbonitrides are hitherto unknown. Following a rational chemical design approach, we synthesized antimony guanidinate SbCN3 at pressures of 32&#8211;38&#8197;GPa using various synthetic routes in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. SbCN3, which is isostructural to calcite CaCO3, can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its structure contains the previously elusive guanidinate anion [CN3]5&#8722;, marking a fundamental milestone in carbonitride chemistry. The crystal structure of SbCN3 was solved and refined from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and was fully corroborated by theoretical calculations, which also predict that SbCN3 has a direct band gap with the value of 2.20&#8197;eV. This study opens a straightforward route to the entire new family of inorganic nitridocarbonates.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite With Heat Switching Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 exhibits heat switching birefringence which may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals that can switch light polarization have important applications in optoelectronics. In the last decades, birefringence is mostly optimized by chemical strategies. Recently, switching birefringence by physical means has attracted much attention. Here, this work reports the observation of heat switching birefringence in a 2D layered hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 ((C2N3H4)+=1,2,4&#8208;triazolium). This heat switching birefringence leads to a significant change in the interference color for the crystal plate under the illumination of orthogonal polarized light. Structure analyses reveal a heat dependent structure transition in (C2N3H4)2PbCl4, whose birefringence is switched by the change in the distortion degree of PbCl6 octahedron. This discovery may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid halide perovskite (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits heat switching birefringence which may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli-responsive polarization optical devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birefringent crystals that can switch light polarization have important applications in optoelectronics. In the last decades, birefringence is mostly optimized by chemical strategies. Recently, switching birefringence by physical means has attracted much attention. Here, this work reports the observation of heat switching birefringence in a 2D layered hybrid halide perovskite (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=1,2,4-triazolium). This heat switching birefringence leads to a significant change in the interference color for the crystal plate under the illumination of orthogonal polarized light. Structure analyses reveal a heat dependent structure transition in (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, whose birefringence is switched by the change in the distortion degree of PbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron. This discovery may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli-responsive polarization optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dearomative Ring&#8208;Fused Azafulleroids and Carbazole&#8208;Derived Metallofullerenes: Reactivity Dictated by Encapsulation in a Fullerene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent reactivities of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls toward C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 have been disclosed. In the case of C60, a dearomative cascade reaction results in the formation of azafulleroids fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system, whereas Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 undergoes a C&#8722;H insertion pathway, with the generation of carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208; and [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroids and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene.







Abstract
Herein, we report divergent additions of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls to C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80. In stark contrast to that of the previously reported bis&#8208;azide additions, the unexpected cascade reaction leads to the dearomative formation of azafulleroids 2 fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system in the case of C60. In contrast, the corresponding reaction with Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 switches to the C&#8722;H insertion pathway, thereby resulting in multiple isomers, including a carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 3 and a [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 4 and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene 5, whose molecular structures have been unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Among them, the addition type of 5 is observed for the first time in all reported additions of azides to fullerenes. Furthermore, unexpected isomerizations from 3 to 5 and from 4 to 5 have been discovered, providing the first examples of the isomerization of an azafulleroid to a carbazole&#8208;derived fullerene rather than an aziridinofullerene. In particular, the isomerism of the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 4 to the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 5 is unprecedented in fullerene chemistry, contradicting the present understanding that isomerization generally occurs between [5,6]&#8208; and [6,6]&#8208;isomers. Control experiments have been carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, representative azafulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells, thereby resulting in improved power conversion efficiencies.

         <title>Narrowband Fluorescent Emitters Based on BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband green and red fluorescent emitters by fusing naphthalene with multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped frameworks manifest near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm. The resulting electroluminescent devices achieve high external quantum efficiency, low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using conventional fluorescent emitters are currently attracting considerable interests due to outstanding stability and abundant raw materials. To construct high&#8208;performance narrowband fluorophores to satisfy requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays, a strategy fusing multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped moieties to naphthalene is proposed to construct two novel narrowband fluorophores. Green Na&#8722;sBN and red Na&#8722;dBN, manifest narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and molecular horizontal dipole ratios above 90&#8201;%. Their OLEDs exhibit the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances including high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes. The Na&#8722;sBN&#8208;based device achieves EQE as high as 28.8&#8201;% and remains 19.8&#8201;% even at luminance of 100,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Na&#8722;dBN&#8208;based device acquires a record&#8208;high EQE of 25.2&#8201;% among all red OLEDs using pure fluorescent emitters.

         <title>Manipulating Lone&#8208;Pair&#8208;Driven Luminescence in 0D Tin Halides by Pressure&#8208;Tuned Stereochemical Activity from Static to Dynamic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;driven stereochemical activity transformation of the lone pair from static to dynamic was achieved in 0D 5&#8197;s2 metal halides, corresponding to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission switching from a red broadband triplet emission to a sky&#8208;blue narrowband singlet emission.







Abstract
The excellent luminescence properties and structural dynamics driven by the stereoactivity of the lone pair in a variety of low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides have attracted growing investigations for optoelectronic applications. However, the structural and photophysical aspects of the excited state associated with the lone pair expression are currently open questions. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional Sn&#8208;based halides with static stereoactive 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs are selected as a model system to understand the correlations between the distinctive lone pair expression and the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation and charge carrier dynamics by continuous lattice manipulation. Lattice compression drives 5&#8197;s2 lone pair active switching and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) redistribution by suppressing excited&#8208;state structural deformation of the isolated SnBr42&#8722; units. Our results demonstrate that the static expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair results in a red broadband triplet STE emission with a large Stokes shift, while its dynamic expression creates a sky&#8208;blue narrowband emission dominated by the radiative recombination of singlet STEs. Our findings and the photophysical mechanism proposed highlight the stereochemical effects of lone pair expression in controlling light emission properties and offer constructive guidelines for tuning the optoelectronic properties in diverse ns2 metal halides.

         <title>Photocatalytic Enantioselective Hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls with Sulfonyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls has been established, utilizing readily accessible sulfonyl chlorides, and facilitated by visible light irradiation in conjunction with chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis. This protocol enables the production of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity.







Abstract
This research explores the enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the use of visible light and redox&#8208;active chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis, facilitating the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity (exceeding 99&#8201;% ee). A significant challenge entails enhancing the reactivity between chiral metal&#8208;coordinated carbonyl compounds and moderate electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, aiming to minimize the background reactions. The success of our approach stems from two distinctive attributes: 1) the Cl&#8208;atom abstraction employed for sulfonyl radical generation from sulfonyl chlorides, and 2) the single&#8208;electron reduction to produce a key enolate radical Ni&#8208;complex. The latter process appears to enhance the feasibility of the sulfonyl radical's addition to the electron&#8208;rich enolate radical. An in&#8208;depth investigation into the reaction mechanism, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, offers insight into the intricate reaction process. Moreover, the versatility of our methodology is highlighted through its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules, demonstrating its practicality as a strategy for producing &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones.

     alt="Photocatalytic Enantioselective Hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Carbonyls with Sulfonyl Chlorides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyls has been established, utilizing readily accessible sulfonyl chlorides, and facilitated by visible light irradiation in conjunction with chiral Ni-catalysis. This protocol enables the production of a diverse range of &#945;-chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research explores the enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of various &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the use of visible light and redox-active chiral Ni-catalysis, facilitating the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;-chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity (exceeding 99&#8201;% ee). A significant challenge entails enhancing the reactivity between chiral metal-coordinated carbonyl compounds and moderate electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, aiming to minimize the background reactions. The success of our approach stems from two distinctive attributes: 1) the Cl-atom abstraction employed for sulfonyl radical generation from sulfonyl chlorides, and 2) the single-electron reduction to produce a key enolate radical Ni-complex. The latter process appears to enhance the feasibility of the sulfonyl radical's addition to the electron-rich enolate radical. An in-depth investigation into the reaction mechanism, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, offers insight into the intricate reaction process. Moreover, the versatility of our methodology is highlighted through its successful application in the late-stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules, demonstrating its practicality as a strategy for producing &#945;-chiral sulfones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controllable Topological Transformations of 818 Molecular Metalla&#8208;knots by Oxidation of Thiazole&#8208;Based Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric dipyridyl ligand containing a thiazole moiety and two tetracene&#8208;based bimetallic building blocks have be used to synthesize two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots in high yields. Post&#8208;synthetic oxidation of the thiazole&#8208;based ligand under mild conditions resulted in the transformation of the 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots into simple tetranuclear macrocycles.







Abstract
By exploiting coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, high yields of two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be obtained using a thiazole&#8208;moiety&#8208;containing asymmetric dipyridyl ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole (L1), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF/MS), and detailed liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To modulate the self&#8208;assembled structures, m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) was utilized to oxidize thiazole&#8208;based ligand L1 to N&#8208;thiazole&#8208;oxide&#8208;based ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole 3&#8208;oxide (L2), which enabled the selective construction of the corresponding tetranuclear macrocycles. Notably, two molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be topologically transformed from 818 knots to simple monocycles because the L1 alkyne bond was inert toward m&#8208;CPBA, as confirmed by liquid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and elemental analysis.

         <dc:description>
A cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation of tertiary allylic carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. The alkylated products are obtained in high yields and with excellent selectivity towards the kinetic branched regioisomer.

Abstract
Here, we report the development of cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation reactions of tertiary allyl carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. A family of well&#8208;defined tetrahedral cobalt(I) complexes bearing commercially available bidentate bis(phosphine) ligands [(P,P)Co(PPh3)Cl] are synthesized and explored as catalysts in allylic alkylation reactions. The catalyst [(dppp)Co(PPh3)Cl] (dppp=1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane) enables the alkylation of a large variety of tertiary allyl carbonates with high yields and excellent regioselectivity for the branched product. Remarkably, this methodology is selective for the activation of tertiary allyl carbonates even in the presence of secondary allyl carbonates. This contrasts with the selectivity observed in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations enabled by visible light photocatalysis. Mechanistic insights by means of experimental and computational investigations support a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Iodotrimethylsilane as a Reactive Ligand for Surface Etching and Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals toward Efficient Pure&#8208;red to Deep&#8208;red LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange strategy to resurface perovskite nanocrystal surfaces with a chemically active, short and conductive ligand, Iodotrimethylsilane (TMIS), which also functions as a surface passivant. Excellent conductivity and photostability allowed us to fabricate compact, high&#8208;mobility and trap&#8208;free perovskite NC films with high PLQY (&gt;90%). As a result, we achieve CsPbI3 NC&#8208;based PeLEDs with an EQE of ~23%.







Abstract
Resurfacing perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with tight&#8208;binding and conductive ligands to resolve the dynamic ligands&#8212;surface interaction is the fundamental issue for their applications in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Although various types of surface ligands have been proposed, these ligands either exhibit weak Lewis acid/base interactions or need high polar solvents for dissolution and passivation, resulting in a compromise in the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs. Herein, we report a chemically reactive agent (Iodotrimethylsilane, TMIS) to address the trade&#8208;off among conductivity, solubility and passivation using all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 NCs. The liquid TMIS ensures good solubility in non&#8208;polar solvents and reacts with oleate ligands and produces in situ HI for surface etching and passivation, enabling strong&#8208;binding ligands on the NCs surface. We report, as a result, red PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;%, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than the control, and is among the highest CsPbI3 PeLEDs. We further demonstrate the universality of this ligand strategy in the pure bromide system (CsPbBr3), and report EQE of &#8776;20&#8201;% at 640, 652, and 664&#8197;nm. This represents the first demonstration of a chemically reactive ligand strategy that applies to different systems and works effectively in red PeLEDs spanning emission from pure&#8208;red to deep&#8208;red.

         <title>Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization of Ribosomal Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450 enzymes are highly effective catalysts, yet little research has been conducted on their ability to modify ribosomal peptides. Now uncharted bacterial cytochrome P450s responsible for the macrocyclization of ribosomal peptides have been discovered by sequence&#8208; and 3D&#8208;structure&#8208;based genome mining. These P450s exhibit diverse catalytic capabilities, catalyzing aromatic crosslinking by forming C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a fascinating group of natural products that exhibit diverse structural features and bioactivities. P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs stand out as a unique but underexplored family. Herein, we introduce a rule&#8208;based genome mining strategy that harnesses the intrinsic biosynthetic principles of RiPPs, including the co&#8208;occurrence and co&#8208;conservation of precursors and P450s and interactions between them, successfully facilitating the identification of diverse P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs. Intensive BGC characterization revealed four new P450s, KstB, ScnB, MciB, and SgrB, that can catalyze the formation of Trp&#8208;Trp&#8208;Tyr (one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds), Tyr&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;C bond), Trp&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;N bond), and His&#8208;His (ether bond) crosslinks, respectively, within three or four residues. KstB, ScnB, and MciB could accept non&#8208;native precursors, suggesting they could be promising starting templates for bioengineering to construct macrocycles. Our study highlights the potential of P450s to expand the chemical diversity of strained macrocyclic peptides and the range of biocatalytic tools available for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>Infinite Twisted Polycatenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise approach was developed to construct figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight polycatenanes using preorganized double helicates as templates and crosslinking them with silver ions or ethynylene units. Employing Ag(I) ions or ethynylene units as linkers resulted in single&#8208;crystalline 1D coordination poly[n]catenanes and assembling gel fibers, respectively.







Abstract
Poly[n]catenanes have exceptional mechanical bonding properties that give them tremendous potential for use in the development of molecular machines and soft materials. Synthesizing these compounds has, however, proven to be a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a concise method for the construction of twisted polycatenanes. Our approach involves using preorganized double helicates as templates, linked crosswise in a linear fashion by either silver ions or triple bonds. By using this approach, we successfully synthesized twisted polycatenanes with both coordination and covalent bonding employing Ag(I) ions and ethynylene units, respectively, as the linkages and leveraging the same Ag(I)&#8208;templated double helicate in both cases. Synthesis with Ag(I) ions formed a single&#8208;crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination poly[n]catenane, and synthesis using ethynylene units generated 1D fibers which self&#8208;assembled with solvents to form a gel. Our results confirm the potential of multi&#8208;stranded metallohelicates for creating sophisticated mechanically interlocked molecules and polymers, which could pave the way for exploration in the realms of molecular nanotopology and materials design.

         <title>An NIR Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on and MRl Bimodal Probe for Concurrent Real&#8208;time in vivo Sensing and Labeling of &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal imaging probe, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1, has been developed to monitor &#946;&#8208;gal activity in real&#8208;time and to provide valuable assistance for precise tumour removal during surgery in vivo using NIR fluorescence and MRI. Activation of &#946;&#8208;gal results in an increase in the NIR fluorescence intensity, allowing sensitive covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins to promote probe accumulation at the tumour site, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI.







Abstract
To realize sensing and labeling biomarkers is quite challenging in terms of designing multimodal imaging probes. In this study, we developed a novel &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activated bimodal imaging probe that combines near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enable real&#8208;time visualization of activity in living organisms. Upon &#946;&#8208;gal activation, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable 42&#8208;fold increase in NIR fluorescence intensity at 717&#8197;nm, allowing covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins and avoiding molecular escape to promote probe accumulation at the tumor site. This fluorescence reaction enhances the longitudinal relaxivity by approximately 1.9 times, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI. The unique features of Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 enable real&#8208;time and precise visualization of &#946;&#8208;gal activity in live tumor cells and mice. The probe's utilization aids in identifying in situ ovarian tumors, offering valuable assistance in the precise removal of tumor tissue during surgical procedures in mice. The fusion of NIR fluorescence and MRI activation through self&#8208;immobilizing target enzymes or proteins provides a robust approach for visualizing &#946;&#8208;gal activity. Moreover, this approach sets the groundwork for developing other activatable bimodal probes, allowing real&#8208;time in vivo imaging of enzyme activity and localization.

         <title>Improving Low&#8208;temperature Performance and Stability of Na2Ti6O13 Anodes by the Ti&#8722;O Spring Effect through Nb&#8208;doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated effects of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies modulation are achieved via high valence state ion&#8208;doping in case of Nb5+. The modified samples optimized excellent long&#8208;cycle stability, and superior low&#8208;temperature performance in the full cell. Importantly, it is demonstrated for the first time that high&#8208;valent transition metal preferentially replaces the Ti3 site of NTO, effectively improving electrical conductivity and ion diffusion rate. More interestingly, the &#8220;spring effect&#8221; of chemical bonding, which is twisted&#8208;recovered&#8208;twisted with the motion of Na+, is investigated for the first time by in situ Raman, and the stabilizing effect of Nb enables the more regular and reversible &#8220;spring effect&#8221;.







Abstract
Na2Ti6O13 (NTO) with high safety has been regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In the present study, integrated modification of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies regulation are realized in case of Nb&#8208;doping and have obtained significantly enhanced cycling performance with 92&#8201;% reversible capacity retained after 3000&#8197;cycles at 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, unexpected low&#8208;temperature performance with a high discharge capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C is also achieved in the full cell. Theoretical investigation suggests that Nb preferentially replaces Ti3 sites, which effectively improves structural stability and lowers the diffusion energy barrier. What's more important, both the in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Raman furtherly confirm the robust spring effect of the Ti&#8722;O bond, making special charge compensation mechanism and respective regulation strategy to conquer the sluggish transport kinetics and low conductivity, which plays a key role in promoting electrochemical performance.

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;based Bactericide for Efficient Healing of Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide with precisely organized bacterial membrane breaker (DNAzymes, G4/hemin) and abundantly loaded broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic (levofloxacin) was constructed for the efficient healing of infected wounds under the guidance of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Bacteria infection is a significant obstacle in the clinical treatment of exposed wounds facing widespread pathogens. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide for efficient anti&#8208;infection therapy of infected wounds in vivo. In our design, abundant DNAzymes (G4/hemin) can be precisely organized on the DNA origami for controllable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to break bacterial membranes. After the destruction of the membrane, broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic levofloxacin (LEV, loaded in the DNA origami through interaction with DNA duplex) can be easily delivered into the bacteria for successful sterilization. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan, the DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide can achieve targeted and combined antibacterial therapy for efficiently promoting the healing of infected wounds. This tailored DNA origami&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases in vivo.
