         <title>A Unique Wide&#8208;Spacing Fence&#8208;Type Superstructure for Robust High&#8208;Voltage O3&#8208;Type Sodium Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence&#8208;type superstructure (2a &#215; 3a type supercell) into O3&#8208;type layered cathode material Na0.9Li0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3Ti0.3O2 and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4 V. The fence&#8208;type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Li migration and in&#8208;plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d&#8208;spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545 Wh kg&#8722;1, a high rate capability (112.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5C) and a high cycling stability (85.8%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5%@200 cycles). This strategy provides a distinct spacing effect of superstructure to design stable high&#8208;voltage layered cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221; &#8211; in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess &#8211; for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Unnatural Axially Chiral Biaryl &#948;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives via a Chiral Phenanthroline&#8208;Potassium Catalyst&#8208;Enabled Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryl &#948;&#8208;amino acids possess significantly different conformational properties and chiral environment from centrally chiral amino acids, therefore, have drawn considerable attention in the fields of synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, a novel chiral phenanthroline&#8208;potassium catalyst has been developed by constructing a well&#8208;organized axially chiral ligand composed of one 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline unit and two axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) units. In the presence of this catalyst, good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98:2 er) have been achieved in the ring&#8208;opening alcoholytic dynamic kinetic resolution of a variety of biaryl lactams, thereby providing an efficient protocol for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of unnatural axially chiral biaryl &#948;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Hepatic Biotransformation of Renal Clearable Gold Nanoparticles for Noninvasive Detection of Liver Glutathione Level via Urinalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal clearable nanoparticles have&#160;been&#160;drawing much attention as they can avoid prolonged accumulation in the body by efficiently clearing through the kidneys. While much effort has been made to understand their interactions within the kidneys, it remains unclear whether their transport could be influenced by other organs, such as the liver, which&#160;plays a crucial role in metabolizing and eliminating both endogenous and exogenous substances through various biotransformation processes. Here, by utilizing renal clearable IRDye800CW conjugated gold nanocluster (800CW4&#8208;GS18&#8208;Au25) as a model, we found that although 800CW4&#8208;GS18&#8208;Au25&#160;strongly resisted serum&#8208;protein binding and exhibited minimal accumulation in the liver, its surface was still gradually modified by hepatic glutathione&#8208;mediated biotransformation&#160;when passing through the liver,&#160;resulting in the dissociation of IRDye800CW from Au25&#160;and biotransformation&#8208;generated&#160;fingerprint message&#160;of 800CW4&#8208;GS18&#8208;Au25&#160;in urine, which allowed us to facilely quantify its urinary biotransformation index (UBI) via urine chromatography analysis. Moreover, we observed the linear correlation between UBI and hepatic glutathione concentration,&#160;offering us a noninvasive method for&#160;quantitative detection of liver glutathione level through a simple urine test. Our discoveries would broaden the fundamental understanding of&#160;in vivo&#160;transport of nanoparticles and advance the development of urinary probes for noninvasive biodetection.</dc:description>

         <title>High Photoinitiating Efficiency of Benzothioxanthene&#8208;based Oxime Esters in Photopolymerization via Photocleavage and/or Single Electron Transfer under Visible Light and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, six benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were employed as photoinitiators for photopolymerization with visible light (LED) and sunlight. Their abilities to behave as Type I photoinitiators by mean of a photocleavage mechanism of oxime esters but also in multicomponent photoinitiating system with an iodonium salt (through an electron transfer mechanism) were both explored with the different structures. Due to their broad absorption spectra tailing up 600 nm, photoinitiating properties of the benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were systematically tested under excitation with low&#8208;intensity LED light at wavelengths of 405 nm and 450 nm. Additionally, to the polymerization tests done under artificial light, different benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were also investigated as solar photoinitiators and displayed a high reactivity in France (Western Europe) even in winter conditions. For the best candidates i.e. the most reactive structures, direct laser write experiments were carried out, evidencing the interest of these structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). &#160;Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesize the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group 14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions &#8211; cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials &#8211; terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Oxidation Catalysts through Confining Pd Clusters on CeO2 Nano&#8208;Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CeO2&#8208;supported noble metal clusters are attractive catalytic materials for several applications. However, atomic dispersion under oxidizing reaction conditions often leads to catalyst deactivation. In this study, the noble metal cluster formation threshold is rationally adjusted by using a mixed CeO2&#8208;Al2O3 support. The preferential location of Pd on CeO2 islands leads to a high local surface noble metal concentration and promotes the in situ formation of small Pd clusters at a rather low noble metal loading (0.5&#160;wt.%), which are shown to be the active species for CO conversion at these low temperatures. As elucidated by complementary in situ/operando techniques, the spatial separation of CeO2 islands on Al2O3 confines the mobility of Pd, preventing the full redispersion or the formation of larger noble metal particles and maintaining a high CO oxidation activity at low temperatures. In a broader perspective, this approach to more efficiently use the noble metal can be transferred to further systems and reactions in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Air Processed Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with over 21% Efficiency Enabled by Multifunctional Ethacridine Lactate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide perovskites (CsPbI3) have attracted increasing attention due to their good thermal stability, remarkable optoelectronic properties, and adaptability in tandem solar cells. However, N2&#8208;filled glovebox is generally required to strictly control the humidity during film fabrication due to the moisture&#8208;induced black&#8208;to&#8208;yellow phase transition, which remains a great hinderance for further commercialization. Herein, we report an effective approach via incorporating multifunctional ethacridine lactate (EAL) to mitigate moisture invasion and enable the fabrication of efficient inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under ambient condition. It is revealed that the lactate anions accelerate the crystallization of CsPbI3, shortening the exposure time to moisture during film fabrication. Meanwhile, the conjugated backbone and multiple functional groups in the ethacridine cations can interact with I&#8208; and Pb2+ to reduce the undesired defects, stabilize the perovskite structure and facilitate the charge transport in the film. Moreover, EAL incorporation also leads to better energy alignment, thus favoring charge extraction at both upper and bottom interfaces. Consequently, the device efficiency and stability are enormously enhanced, with the champion efficiency reaching 21.08%. This even surpasses the highest value reported for the devices fabricated in glovebox, representing a record efficiency of inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Discovery of Spherical Carborane Molecular Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carborane compounds, known for their exceptional thermal stability and non&#8208;toxic attributes, have garnered widespread utility in medicine, supramolecular design, coordination/organometallic chemistry, and others. Although there is considerable interest among chemists, the integration of suitable carborane molecules into ferroelectric materials remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we employ the quasi&#8208;spherical design strategy to introduce functional groups at the boron vertices of the o&#8208;carborane cage, aiming to reduce molecular symmetry. This approach led to the successful synthesis of the pioneering ferroelectric crystals composed of cage&#8208;like carboranes: 9&#8208;OH&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (1) and 9&#8208;SH&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (2), which undergo above&#8208;room ferroelectric phase transitions (Tc) at approximately 367 K and 347 K. Interestingly, 1 and 2 represent uniaxial and multiaxial ferroelectrics respectively, with 2 exhibiting six polar axes and as many as twelve equivalent polarization directions. As the pioneering instance of carborane ferroelectric crystals, this study introduces a novel structural archetype for molecular ferroelectrics, thereby providing fresh insights into the exploration of molecular ferroelectric crystals with promising applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Activation of Lattice Oxygen Site Through Coordination Engineering to Boost the Activity and Stability of Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Ru&#8208;based materials are among the outstanding catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the instability issue still haunts them and impedes the widespread application. The instability of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts is generally ascribed to the formation of soluble species through the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru and structural decomposition caused by involvement of lattice oxygen. Herein, an effective strategy of selectively activating the lattice oxygen around Ru site is proposed to improve the OER activity and stability. Our synthesized spinel&#8208;type electrocatalyst of Ru and Zn co&#8208;doped Co3O4 showed an ultralow overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a long&#8208;term stability reaching to 100 hours at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for alkaline OER. The experimental results and theoretical simulations demonstrated that the lattice oxygen site jointly connected with the octahedral Ru and tetrahedral Zn atoms became more active than other oxygen sites near Ru atom, which further lowered the reaction energy barriers and avoided generating excessive oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of Ru sites. The findings hope to provide a new perspective to improve the catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;incorporated OER catalysts and the stability of lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Luminescent Hybrid Bimetallic Halide Family with Solvent&#8208;Coordinated Rare Earth and Alkaline Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new family of 21&#8197;hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A = rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L = solvent ligand; B = Sb, Bi and Te), demonstrating high compositional and structural diversity. These materials have high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) attributed to the triplet radiative recombination from Sb or the emission of the RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a PLQY of 94&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are an extraordinary class of optoelectronic materials with extensive applications. To further diversify and study the in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property relations, we report here a new family of 21 zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A=rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L=solvent ligand; and B=Sb, Bi and Te). The RE(DMSO)8[BCl6] (RE=La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide) series shows broadband emission attributed to triplet radiative recombination from Sb and Bi, incorporating the characteristic emission of RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a staggering PL quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The pseudo&#8208;octahedral [SbCl5] with Cl vacancy in AII(DMSO)6[SbCl5] (AII=Mg, Ca and Mn) and the square pyramidal [SbCl5] in AII(TMSO)6[SbCl5] (TMSO=tetramethylene sulfoxide) enhance the stereoactive expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs of Sb3+, giving rise to the observation of dual&#8208;band emission of singlet and triplet emission, respectively. A series of Te(IV) analogues have been characterized, showing blue&#8208;light&#8208;excitable single&#8208;band emission. This work expands the materials space for hybrid bimetallic halides with an emphasis on harnessing the RE elements, and provides important insights into designing new emitters and regulating their properties.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligand Enables Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Propargyl C&#8722;H Functionalization via Reactive Gold Allenylidene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive gold allenylidenes are catalytically generated via ligand&#8208;enabled redox decomposition of alkynylbenziodoxole substrates. In cooperation with gold, a remote amide group in the biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligand is remarkably capable of deprotonating at the propargylic position. DFT calculations offer support to the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Gold allenylidene species have been seldom exploited as reactive intermediates in synthetically versatile catalytic reactions. By employing alkynylbenziodoxoles as the substrates and bifunctional WangPhos as the metal ligand, this work demonstrated ready catalytic access to these intermediates of general substitution patterns and their electrophilic reactivities at the &#947;&#8208;carbon center with a diverse range of nucleophiles. The reaction is driven by the reductive decomposition of the benziodoxole moiety and achieves the replacement of a propargylic proton with an N/O/C&#8208;based nucleophile, hence realizing reactivity umpolung. Corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the reaction mechanism involves a mild propargylic deprotonation. In contrast to prior works employing a tertiary amine functionality, a weakly Br&#216;nsted&#8208;basic amide group in WangPhos is surprisingly effective in deprotonation at the propargylic position under a gold&#8208;ligand cooperation regime.

         <title>N2 Functionalization via Molybdenum&#8208;Nitride Complex: Stepwise BH Bond Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of the Mo&#8801;N bond of a [(PPP)Mo(N)I] complex, which is obtained by N2 splitting, reveals guiding principles to N2 splitting and functionalization to give amine derivatives. The reaction of the N at a Mo center with BH bonds depends on the R2BH reagent.







Abstract
Reactivity of (triphosphine)MoIV&#8208;nitrido complex generated by N2 splitting, toward boranes is reported. The simple adduct Mo&#8801;N&#8594;BH3 is observed with BH3.SMe2 while 1,2 addition is evidenced with 9&#8208;BBN leading to H&#8722;Mo=NBR2. A second addition of BH3.SMe2 is facile and forms an unprecedented complex featuring two bridging H between two B and the Mo centers. Addition of PMe3 or BH3.SMe2 promotes reductive elimination and N&#8722;H bond formation. The full sequence of functionalization at Mo&#8801;N obtained after N2 splitting is therefore evidenced in this work.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Twisting&#8208;Induced Helical Structures from Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Based Fibers Containing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a combination of wet spinning and twisting technique to continuously yield a novel circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) fibers, which can enable merging phosphorescence, handedness, robustness, flexibility, and knittability in a single system.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered significant attention owing to its distinctive optical characteristics and broad range of potential applications. However, the challenge remains in producing RTP materials with more simplicity, versatility, and practicality on a large scale, particularly in achieving chiral signals within a single system. Herein, we show that a straightforward and effective combination of wet spinning and twisting technique enables continuously fabricating RTP fibers with twisting&#8208;induced helical chirality. By leveraging the hydrogen bonding interactions between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and quinoline derivatives, along with the rigid microenvironment provided by PVA chains, typically, Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber demonstrates outstanding phosphorescent characteristics with RTP lifetime of 1.08&#8197;s and phosphorescence quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;%, and the improved tensile strength being 1.7 times than pure PVA fiber (172&#177;5.82 vs 100&#177;5.65&#8197;MPa). Impressively, the transformation from RTP to circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) is readily achieved by imparting left&#8208; or right&#8208;hand helical structure through simply twisting, enabling large&#8208;scale production of chiral Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber with dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;2. Besides, an array of displays and encryption patterns are crafted by weaving or seaming to exemplify the promising applications of these PVA&#8208;based fibers with outstanding adaptivity in cutting&#8208;edge anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Insights into E.&#8197;coli Cyclopropane Fatty Acid Synthase (CFAS) Towards Enantioselective Carbene Free Biocatalytic Cyclopropanation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New insights into the stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as catalytic activity of the E. coli CFAS enzyme are disclosed. The selectivity of ecCFAS in the cyclopropanation of various phospholipids and the influence of vesicle formation on the catalytic activity have been reported. Mutagenesis and in silico experiments have been carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis. The biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate was accomplished with ecCFAS and catalytic SAM cofactor.







Abstract
Cyclopropane fatty acid synthases (CFAS) are a class of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase enzymes able to catalyse the cyclopropanation of unsaturated phospholipids. Since CFAS enzymes employ SAM as a methylene source to cyclopropanate alkene substrates, they have the potential to be mild and more sustainable biocatalysts for cyclopropanation transformations than current carbene&#8208;based approaches. This work describes the characterisation of E.&#8197;coli CFAS (ecCFAS) and its exploitation in the stereoselective biocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropyl lipids. ecCFAS was found to convert phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to methyl dihydrosterculate 1 with up to 58&#8201;% conversion and 73&#8201;% ee and the absolute configuration (9S,10R) was established. Substrate tolerance of ecCFAS was found to be correlated with the electronic properties of phospholipid headgroups and for the first time ecCFAS was found to catalyse cyclopropanation of both phospholipid chains to form dicyclopropanated products. In addition, mutagenesis and in silico experiments were carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis and to provide structural insights into the lipid substrate preference of ecCFAS. Finally, the biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate 1 and its deuterated analogue was also accomplished combining recombinant ecCFAS with the SAM regenerating AtHMT enzyme in the presence of CH3I and CD3I respectively.

         <title>Converting Carbon Dioxide into Carbon Nanotubes by Reacting with Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed to produce carbon nanotubes from CO2 and C2H6 at 750&#8201;&#176;C, utilizing earth&#8208;abundant transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) as catalysts. The process simultaneously generates syngas as byproducts. The morphology of the carbon nanotube depends on the type of catalysts.







Abstract
The urgency to mitigate environmental impacts from anthropogenic CO2 emissions has propelled extensive research efforts on CO2 reduction. The current work reports a novel approach involving transforming CO2 and ethane into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using earth&#8208;abundant metals (Fe, Co, Ni) at 750&#8201;&#176;C. This route facilitates long&#8208;term carbon storage via generating high&#8208;value CNTs and produces valuable syngas with adjustable H2/CO ratios as byproducts. Without CO2, direct pyrolysis of ethane undergoes rapid deactivation. The participation of CO2 not only enhances the durability of the catalyst, but also contributes about 30&#8201;% of the CNTs production, presenting a viable solution to CO2 challenges. The CNT morphology depends on the catalyst used. Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts produce CNT with a 20&#8197;nm diameter and micrometer length, whereas Fe&#8208;based catalysts yield bamboo&#8208;like structures. This work represents a pioneering effort in utilizing CO2 and ethane for CNT production with potential environmental and economic benefits.

         <title>Multivariate Silicification&#8208;Assisted Single Enzyme Structure Augmentation for Improved Enzymatic Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221; is introduced, where inorganic silica precursors are used to balance the flexibility and stability of an enzyme. The integration of the enzyme with an organosilica framework brings advantages including surface microenvironment adjustability, structure augmentation, prolonged stability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility, which have the potential to expand enzyme applications.







Abstract
The ability to finely tune/balance the structure and rigidity of enzymes to realize both high enzymatic activity and long&#8208;term stability is highly desired but highly challenging. Herein, we propose the concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221;, where solid inorganic silica undergoes controlled hybridization with the fragile enzyme under moderate conditions at the single&#8208;enzyme level, thus enabling simultaneous structure augmentation, long&#8208;term stability, and high enzymatic activity preservation. A multivariate silicification approach was utilized and occurred around individual enzymes to allow conformal coating. To realize a high activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off the structure flexibility/rigidity of the silicazyme was optimized by a component adjustment ternary (CAT) plot method. Moreover, the multivariate organosilica frameworks bring great advantages, including surface microenvironment adjustability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility through the rich chemistry of silica. Overall silicazymes represent a new class of enzymes with promise for catalysis, separations, and nanomedicine.

         <title>Unveiling the Mechanistic Role of Chiral Palladacycles in Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of carboxylic acids, the key palladacycles were isolated and characterized. Intermediate chemistry and stoichiometric transformation studies of the chiral palladacycles revealed that the C&#8722;H palladation step is irreversible and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining, and the functionalization step is ligand&#8208;independent.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions has attracted considerable attention due to its ability for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched molecules and stimulation of novel retrosynthetic disconnections. Understanding the reaction mechanism, especially the stereochemical process of the reaction, is crucial for the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems. Previously, we developed a Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalytic system for asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions. In this study, we focused on unraveling the chemistry of chiral palladacycles involved in the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. We have isolated key palladacycle intermediates involved in the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of carboxylic acids catalyzed by the Pd(II)/SOHP system. These palladacycles, exhibiting ligand&#8208;induced chirality, provided a significant opportunity to investigate the stereochemical process and the ligand effect in this asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization. Our investigation provided direct evidence for the C&#8722;H palladation step as the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, which forms diastereomeric palladacycles that exhibited preservation of chirality in the functionalization step. DFT calculations provided insights into the chiral induction in palladacycle formation. This work highlights the value of chiral palladacycle chemistry in offering mechanistic insights into the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions.

         <title>Cascaded *CO&#8722;*COH Intermediates on a Nonmetallic Plasmonic Photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 with 90.6&#8201;% Selectivity</title>

The &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221;&#8208;stabilized W/Z plasmonic photocatalyst achieved efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion (653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221; strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst. Moreover, photoelectrons contribute to the local multi&#8208;electron environment of W18O49, enhancing the intrinsic excitation of its hot electrons with extended lifetimes, as confirmed by in situ XPS and femtosecond transient absorption analysis. Density functional theory calculations revealed that W/Z with OV enhances CO2 adsorption, activating *CO production, while reducing the energy barrier for *COH production (0.054&#8197;eV) and subsequent *CO&#8722;*COH coupling (0.574&#8197;eV). Successive hydrogenation revealed that the free energy for *CH2CH2 hydrogenation (0.108&#8197;eV) was lower than that for *CH2CH2 desorption for C2H4 production (0.277&#8197;eV), favouring C2H6 production. Consequently, W/Z achieves an efficient C2H6 activity of 653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%. This work offers a new strategy for the rational design of plasmonic photocatalysts with high selectivity for C2+ products.

         <title>Advancing Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Isoreticular Cluster Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dimension to isoreticular chemistry is enabled by using isoreticular cluster concept to develop a series of hierarchical clusters whose co&#8208;assembly can follow different pathways dictated by a delicate balance between various competing chemical interactions.







Abstract
Trigonal planar M3(O/OH) trimers are among the most important clusters in inorganic chemistry and are the foundational features of multiple high&#8208;impact MOF platforms. Here we introduce a concept called isoreticular cluster series and demonstrate that M3(O/OH), as the first member of a supertrimer series, can be combined with a higher hierarchical member (double&#8208;deck trimer here) to advance isoreticular chemistry. We report here an isoreticular series of pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned MOFs called M3M6 pacs made from co&#8208;assembly between M3 single&#8208;deck trimer and M3x2 double&#8208;deck trimer. Important factors were identified on this multi&#8208;modular MOF platform to guide optimization of each module, which enables the phase selection of M3M6 pacs by overcoming the formation of previously&#8208;always&#8208;observed same&#8208;cluster phases. The new pacs materials exhibit high surface area and high uptake capacity for CO2 and small hydrocarbons, as well as selective adsorption properties relevant to separation of industrially important mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4. Furthermore, new M3M6 pacs materials show electrocatalytic properties with high activity.

&lt;p&gt;A new dimension to isoreticular chemistry is enabled by using isoreticular cluster concept to develop a series of hierarchical clusters whose co-assembly can follow different pathways dictated by a delicate balance between various competing chemical interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trigonal planar M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O/OH) trimers are among the most important clusters in inorganic chemistry and are the foundational features of multiple high-impact MOF platforms. Here we introduce a concept called isoreticular cluster series and demonstrate that M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O/OH), as the first member of a supertrimer series, can be combined with a higher hierarchical member (double-deck trimer here) to advance isoreticular chemistry. We report here an isoreticular series of pore-space-partitioned MOFs called M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

Important factors were identified on this multi-modular MOF platform to guide optimization of each module, which enables the phase selection of M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

A cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modifications of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The twin&#8208;cage has four binding sites, which show site discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The copper(I) guest inside the tri&#8208;imine cage is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of bright emissive precursor clusters triggered by H2O2 solution.







Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;cluster&#8208;based twin&#8208;cage has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modification of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has double cavities and four binding sites, which show site&#8208;discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The guests in the tripodal hats affect the luminescence of the cluster: the tetra&#8208;silver(I) host&#8211;guest complex is weakly red&#8208;emissive, while the bis&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;bis&#8208;silver(I) one is non&#8208;emissive but is a stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecule. The copper(I) ion inside the tri&#8208;imine cavity is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of the bright emissive precursor cluster triggered by H2O2 solution. The hybridization of a cluster with cavities to construct a cluster&#8208;based cage presents an innovative concept for functional cluster design, and the post&#8208;clustering covalent modification opens up new avenues for finely tuning the properties of clusters.

         <title>Responsive Organic Fluorescent Aggregates Based on Ion&#8208;&#960; Interactions Away from Fluorescent Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules containing the same conjugated groups and different anions (Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;) exhibit completely different fluorescence behaviors under external stimuli. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders.







Abstract
Responsive organic luminescent aggregates have a wide range of application fields, but currently there is still a lack of reasonable molecular design strategies. Introducing ion&#8208;&#960; interactions into molecules can effectively alter their luminescent properties. However, current research typically focuses on ion localization at luminescent conjugated groups with the strong interaction forces. In this work, we introduce the flexible alkoxy chain spacers between fluorescent conjugated groups and ion&#8208;&#960; interaction sites, and then adjust the fluorescence performance of the molecule by changing the strength of ion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules with strong ion&#8208;&#960; interactions exhibit high and stable fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders under the external stimuli. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules with weak ion&#8208;&#960; interactions have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders, showing variable fluorescence intensities under external stimuli. This demonstrates a new class of responsive organic luminescent solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Ultralow Catalytic Loading for Optimised Electrocatalytic Performance of AuPt Nanoparticles to Produce Hydrogen and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antenna&#8208;reactor nanoparticles (NPs) are at the forefront of plasmonic catalysis. This work demonstrates that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component in gold&#8208;platinum (AuPt) NPs unlock superior catalytic activity and controlled selectivity for hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions under visible&#8208;light excitation. This finding paves the way for designing highly efficient plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions are key to producing green hydrogen and ammonia. Antenna&#8211;reactor nanoparticles hold promise to improve the performances of these transformations under visible&#8208;light excitation, by combining plasmonic and catalytic materials. However, current materials involve compromising either on the catalytic activity or the plasmonic enhancement and also lack control of reaction selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component optimize catalytic activity and selectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Taking Pt&#8722;Au as an example we find that fine&#8208;tuning the Pt content produces a 6&#8208;fold increase in the hydrogen evolution compared to commercial Pt/C as well as a 6.5&#8208;fold increase in the nitrite reduction and a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in the selectivity for producing ammonia under visible light excitation relative to dark conditions. Density functional theory suggests that the catalytic reactions are accelerated by the intimate contact between nanoscale Pt&#8208;rich and Au&#8208;rich regions at the surface, which facilitates the formation of electron&#8208;rich hot&#8208;carrier puddles associated with the Pt&#8208;based active sites. The results provide exciting opportunities to design new materials with improved photocatalytic performance for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Planar Tetranuclear Uranium Hydride Cluster Supported by ansa&#8208;Bis(cyclopentadienyl) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a U4H8 cluster was stabilized by ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligands, representing the largest uranium hydride cluster reported to date. The four uranium centers are arranged in planar rhombic geometry, which differs from the polyhedral geometry observed in previously reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters.







Abstract
Polynuclear metal hydride clusters play important roles in various catalytic processes, with most of the reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters adopting a polyhedral three&#8208;dimensional structure. Herein, we report the first example of a planar tetranuclear uranium hydride cluster [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]4(&#956;2&#8208;H)4(&#956;3&#8208;H)4 (U4H8). It was synthesized by reacting an ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand&#8208;supported uranium chloride precursor [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2 with NaHBEt3. The presence of hydrides in U4H8 was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and its reactivity with phenol and carbon tetrachloride. DFT calculations also facilitated the determination of the hydrides&#8217; positions in U4H8, featuring four bridging &#956;2&#8208;H ligands and four face&#8208;capping &#956;3&#8208;H ligands, with the four U centers arranged in a rhombic geometry. The U4H8 represents not only the first example of planar polynuclear actinide metal hydride cluster but also the uranium hydride cluster with the highest nuclearity reported to date.

         <title>Enable the Domino&#8208;Like Structural Recovering in Bismuth Anode to Achieve Fast and Durable Na/K Storages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk inlaid architecture with bismuth nanospheres enclosed in an N&#8208;doped bulk carbon (BiNC). Such a structure can enable the reversible Na3Bi&#8596;layered Bi phase transition triggered by the compressive stress&#8208;induced &#8220;domino&#8221; effect, thus suppress the irreversible structural evolutions to achieve an extraordinary cyclic stability.







Abstract
Alloying&#8208;type anodes show capacity and density advantages for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs), but they encounter serious structural degradation upon cycling, which cannot be resolved through conventional nanostructuring techniques. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth study to reveal the intrinsic reason for the pulverization of bismuth (Bi) materials upon (de)alloying, and report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk architecture with Bi nanospheres inlaid in the bulk carbon (BiNC) to achieve durable Na/K storage. We simulate the volume&#8208;expansion&#8208;resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction, and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10&#8201;%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a &#8220;domino&#8208;like&#8221; Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for SIBs, 848.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3&#8201;% for SIBs, 96.4&#8201;% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000&#8197;cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015&#8201;% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work provides new insights on the undesirable structural evolution, and proposes basic guidelines for design of the anti&#8208;degradation structure for alloy&#8208;type electrode materials.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from C64 Nanographene Tetraimide by &#960;&#8208;Stacking Complexation with Platinum Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) at the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum is challenging to achieve. Here, we show the sensitization of C64 nanographene tetraimide's triplet state by supramolecular complexation with a platinum porphyrin that exerts an external heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit coupling involving Pt d&#8208;orbitals and nanographene &#960;&#8208;orbitals.







Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at room temperature is challenging to achieve for organic molecules due to negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling and a low energy gap leading to fast non&#8208;radiative transitions. Here, we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to harvest the energy from the low&#8208;lying triplet state of C64 nanographene tetraimide 1. 1H&#8197;NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometric binding of a Pt(II) porphyrin on the two &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1. While the free 1 does not show emission in the NIR, the host&#8211;guest complex solution shows NIR phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. Further, between 860&#8211;1100&#8197;nm, room temperature NIR phosphorescence (&#955;max=900&#8197;nm, &#964;avg=142&#8197;&#956;s) was observed for a solid&#8208;state sample drop&#8208;casted from a preformed complex in solution. Theoretical calculations reveal a non&#8208;zero spin&#8211;orbit coupling between isoenergetic S1 and T3 of &#960;&#8208;stacked [1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pt(II) porphyrin] complex. External heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit coupling along with rigidification and protection from oxygen in the solid&#8208;state promotes both the intersystem crossing from the first excited singlet state into the triplet manifold and the NIR phosphorescence from the lowest triplet state of 1.

         <title>Helically Chiral &#960;&#8208;Expanded Azocines Through Regioselective Beckmann Rearrangement and Their Charged States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allowed for convenient synthesis of negatively curved &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes with integrated azocine units. The helical compounds display high configurational stability and distinct homoenantiomeric &#960;&#8208; &#960; stacking in the solid state. Amphoteric two electron redox chemistry allows for characterization of the charged species with near&#8208;infrared absorption extending over 3000&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report a synthetic approach to &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes incorporating tropone and azocine units in combination with a 5&#8208;membered ring, which exhibit intriguing structural, electronic, and chiroptical properties. The regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allows the isolation of helical scaffolds containing 8&#8208;membered lactam, azocine, and amine units. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the incorporation of tropone or azocine units leads to highly distorted [6]helicene moieties, with distinct packing motifs in the solid state. The compounds exhibit promising optoelectronic properties with considerable photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission wavelengths depending on the relative position of the nitrogen center within the polycyclic framework. Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#8197;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.

         <title>Regulating Spin Density using TEMPOL Molecules for Enhanced CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion by HKUST&#8208;1 Framework Derived Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin density of active Cu sites is regulated by incorporating nitroxide radicals (TEMPOL) in HKUST&#8208;1 frameworks. The formation of localized spin&#8208;ordered phase in the pristine spin&#8208;disordered phase allows for the asymmetric spin configuration on Cu&#8722;Cu sites in TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1. Therefore, its derived electrocatalyst shows a two&#8208;fold spin&#8208;enhanced ethylene selectivity in CO2 reduction compared to HKUST&#8208;1.







Abstract
The selectivity of multicarbon products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the spin alignment of neighboring active sites, which requires a spin catalyst that facilitates electron transfer with antiparallel spins for enhanced C&#8722;C coupling. Here, we design a radical&#8208;contained spin catalyst (TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1) to enhance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion, in which spin&#8208;disordered (SDO) and spin&#8208;ordered (SO) phases co&#8208;exist to construct an asymmetric spin configuration of neighboring active sites. The replacement of axially coordinated H2O molecules with TEMPOL radicals introduces spin&#8208;spin interactions among the Cu(II) centers to form localized SO phases within the original H2O&#8208;mediated SDO phases. Therefore, TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1 derived catalyst exhibited an approximately two&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene selectivity during the CO2RR at &#8722;1.8&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl compared to pristine HKUST&#8208;1. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS spectra indicate that the spin configuration at asymmetric SO/SDO sites significantly reduces the kinetic barrier for *CO intermediate dimerization toward the ethylene product. The performance of the spin catalyst is further improved by spin alignment under a magnetic field, resulting in a maximum ethylene selectivity of more than 50&#8201;%. The exploration of the spin&#8208;polarized kinetics of the CO2RR provides a promising path for the development of novel spin electrocatalysts with superior performance.

         <title>Intrarenal pH&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Diagnosis of Early Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly were developed for highly sensitive and long&#8208;term imaging of different stages of metabolic acidosis induced kidney injury.







Abstract
Metabolic acidosis&#8208;induced kidney injury (MAKI) is asymptomatic and lack of clinical biomarkers in early stage, but rapidly progresses to severe renal fibrosis and ultimately results in end&#8208;stage kidney failure. Therefore, developing rapid and noninvasive strategies direct responsive to renal tubular acidic microenvironment rather than delayed biomarkers are essential for timely renoprotective interventions. Herein, we develop pH&#8208;responsive luminescent gold nanoparticles (p&#8208;AuNPs) in the second near&#8208;infrared emission co&#8208;coated with 2,3&#8208;dimethylaleic anhydride conjugated &#946;&#8208;mercaptoethylamine and cationic 2&#8208;diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride, which showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly for highly sensitive and long&#8208;time (~24&#8197;h) imaging of different stages of MAKI. By integrating advantages of pH&#8208;induced intrarenal self&#8208;assembly and enhanced interactions between pH&#8208;triggered positively charged p&#8208;AuNPs and renal tubular cells, the early&#8208; and late&#8208;stage MAKI could be differentiated rapidly within 10&#8197;min post&#8208;injection (p.i.) with contrast index (CI) of 3.5 and 4.3, respectively. The corresponding maximum CI could reach 5.1 and 9.2 at 12&#8197;h p.i., respectively. Furthermore, p&#8208;AuNPs were demonstrated to effectively real&#8208;time monitor progressive recovery of kidney injury in MAKI mice after therapy, and also exhibit outstanding capabilities for drug screening. This pH&#8208;responsive strategy showed great promise for feedback on kidney dysfunction progression, opening new possibilities for early&#8208;stage diagnosis of pH&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Heavy Pnictogen Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript describes the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted addition of pnictogen&#8208;pnictogen double bonds to a late transition metal. The use of light has been essential to unlock the reactivity of this otherwise unreactive class of compounds.







Abstract
The chemistry of light dipnictenes has been widely investigated in the last century with remarkable achievements especially for azobenzene derivatives. In contrast, distibenes and dibismuthenes are relatively rare and show very limited reactivity. Herein, we have designed a protocol using visible light to enhance the reactivity of heavy dipnictenes. Exploiting the distinctive &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, we have been able to isolate unique examples of dipnictene&#8208;cobalt complexes. The reactivity of the distibene complex was further exploited using red light in the presence of a diazoolefin to access an unusual four&#8208;membered bicyclo[1.1.0]butane analog, containing only a single carbon atom. These findings set the bases to a conceptually new strategy in heavy element double bonds chemistry where visible light is at the front seat of bond activation.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Formation of Sulfurous Acid (H2SO3) in the Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laboratory experiments show the formation of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) from the gas&#8208;phase reaction of OH radicals with CH3S(O)OH for atmospheric reaction conditions with a molar yield of &#8764;50&#8201;%. H2SO3 represents a hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach acid that has never been observed in aqueous solution. In the gas phase, if once formed, it shows a certain kinetic stability with an estimated lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric water vapor conditions.







Abstract
Sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is known to be thermodynamically instable decomposing into SO2 and H2O. All attempts to detect this elusive acid in solution failed up to now. Reported H2SO3 formation from an experiment carried out in a mass spectrometer as well as results from theoretical calculations, however, indicated a possible kinetic stability in the gas phase. Here, it is shown experimentally that H2SO3 is formed in the OH radical&#8208;initiated gas&#8208;phase oxidation of methanesulfinic acid (CH3S(O)OH) at 295&#177;0.5&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar of air with a molar yield of 

53-17+7

 ${{53}_{-17}^{+\ 7}}$



&#8201;%. Further main products are SO2, SO3 and methanesulfonic acid. CH3S(O)OH represents an important intermediate product of dimethyl sulfide oxidation in the atmosphere. Global modeling predicts an annual H2SO3 production of &#8764;8&#8197;million metric tons from the OH+CH3S(O)OH reaction. The investigated H2SO3 depletion in the presence of water vapor results in k(H2O+H2SO3) &lt;3&#215;10&#8722;18&#8197;cm3&#8201;molecule&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which indicates a lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric humidity. This work provides experimental evidence that H2SO3, once formed in the gas phase, is kinetically stable enough to allow its characterization and subsequent reactions.

         <title>Stabilizing Zn/electrolyte Interphasial Chemistry by a Sustained&#8208;Release Drug Inspired Indium&#8208;Chelated Resin Protective Layer for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Zn//V2O5 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer is designed to stabilize the Zn/electrolyte interphasial region. The sustained release of In3+ can provide continuous heterogeneous nucleation sites for Zn deposition and alleviate HER side reactions, meanwhile the anchored resin matrix layer can repel detrimental anions like SO42&#8722; and V10O26(OH)24&#8722;, circumventing serious dendrite growth.







Abstract
For zinc&#8208;metal batteries, the instable chemistry at Zn/electrolyte interphasial region results in severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, significantly impairing Zn anode reversibility. Moreover, an often&#8208;overlooked aspect is this instability can be further exacerbated by the interaction with dissolved cathode species in full batteries. Here, inspired by sustained&#8208;release drug technology, an indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer (Chelex&#8208;In), incorporating a sustained&#8208;release mechanism for indium, is developed on Zn surface, stabilizing the anode/electrolyte interphase to ensure reversible Zn plating/stripping performance throughout the entire lifespan of Zn//V2O5 batteries. The sustained&#8208;release indium onto Zn electrode promotes a persistent anticatalytic effect against HER and fosters uniform heterogeneous Zn nucleation. Meanwhile, on the electrolyte side, the residual resin matrix with immobilized iminodiacetates anions can also repel detrimental anions (SO42&#8722; and polyoxovanadate ions dissolved from V2O5 cathode) outside the electric double layer. This dual synergetic regulation on both electrode and electrolyte sides culminates a more stable interphasial environment, effectively enhancing Zn anode reversibility in practical high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity full battery systems. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired Chelex&#8208;In protective layer enables an ultralong lifespan of Zn anode over 2800&#8197;h, which is also successfully demonstrated in ultrahigh areal capacity Zn//V2O5 full batteries (4.79&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Revealing Hydrogen Bond Effect in Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of quinone&#8208;based small molecules with progressive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) numbers has been rationally designed to reveal the real effects of H&#8208;bond on the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials (OEMs) in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). The appropriate number of H&#8208;bonds in OEM improves its structure stability and utilization of active sites and reduces the battery polarization, contributing to the construction of high&#8208;performance ZOBs.







Abstract
The surrounding hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) interaction around the active sites plays indispensable functions in enabling the organic electrode materials (OEMs) to fulfill their roles as ion reservoirs in aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Despite important, there are still no works could fully shed its real effects light on. Herein, quinone&#8208;based small molecules with a H&#8208;bond evolution model has been rationally selected to disclose the regulation and equilibration of H&#8208;bond interaction between OEMs, and OEM and the electrolyte. It has been found that only a suitable H&#8208;bond interaction could make the OEMs fully liberate their potential performance. Accordingly, the 2,5&#8208;diaminocyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (DABQ) with elaborately designed H&#8208;bond structure exhibits a capacity of 193.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a record&#8208;high mass loading of 66.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, the DABQ//Zn battery also possesses air&#8208;rechargeable ability by utilizing the chemistry redox of proton. Our results put forward a specific pathway to precise utilization of H&#8208;bond to liberate the performance of OEMs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Linked Non&#8208;Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful atroposelective synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers marks a significant milestone in organic synthesis. Unlike conventional atropisomers, these unique molecules display generally lower enantiomerization barriers due to possible concerted bond rotations. Through innovative strategies, chemists have succeeded in controlling the atroposelectivity of these reactions, enabling the construction of original optically active molecular structures.







Abstract
Atropisomers hold significant fascination, not only for their prevalence in natural compounds but also for their biological importance and wide&#8208;ranging applications as chiral materials, ligands, and organocatalysts. While biaryl and heterobiaryl atropisomers are commonly studied, the enantioselective synthesis of less abundant heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers presents a formidable challenge in modern organic synthesis. Unlike classical atropisomers, these molecules allow rotation around two bonds, resulting in low barriers to enantiomerization through concerted bond rotations. In recent years the discovery of new configurationally stable rare non&#8208;biaryl scaffolds such as aryl amines, aryl ethers and aryl sulfones as well as innovative methodologies to control their configuration have been disclosed in the literature and constitute the topic of this minireview.

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Tag&#8208;Generation Proximity Labeling Technology for Recording Cellular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an &#8220;in&#8208;situ&#8208;tag&#8208;generation mechanism&#8221; and develop the GalTag technology based on galactose oxidase (GAO) for recording cellular interactions. GAO mounted on bait cells can in situ generate bio&#8208;orthogonal aldehyde tags as interaction reporters on prey cells. GalTag is unique in that it eliminates the need to add tag molecules, resulting in the ability to record bait footprints in three&#8208;dimensional biological solid regions.







Abstract
Obtaining information about cellular interactions is fundamental to the elucidation of physiological and pathological processes. Proximity labeling technologies have been widely used to report cellular interactions in situ; however, the reliance on addition of tag molecules typically restricts their application to regions where tags can readily diffuse, while the application in, for example, solid tissues, is susceptible. Here, we propose an &#8220;in&#8208;situ&#8208;tag&#8208;generation mechanism&#8221; and develop the GalTag technology based on galactose oxidase (GAO) for recording cellular interactions within three&#8208;dimensional biological solid regions. GAO mounted on bait cells can in situ generate bio&#8208;orthogonal aldehyde tags as interaction reporters on prey cells. Using GalTag, we monitored the dynamics of cellular interactions and assessed the targeting ability of engineered cells. In particular, we recorded, for the first time, the footprints of Bacillus Calmette&#8208;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) invasion into the bladder tissue of living mice, providing a valuable perspective to elucidate the anti&#8208;tumor mechanism of BCG.

         <title>Elucidating the discrepancy between the intrinsic structural instability and the apparent catalytic steadiness of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the widespread investigations on the M&#8208;N&#8208;C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure&#8208;property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well&#8208;designed pH&#8208;dependent metal leaching experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni&#8208;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8208;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8208;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for Efficient and Selective SO2 Capture from CO2&#8208;rich Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capture of a low concentration SO2 is of utmost importance as it is responsible for many health and environmental issues. Herein we unveiled two porous organic polymers encompassing a high content of imidazole pockets to interact preferentially with SO2 vs CO2 which can remove trace amount of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams with almost infinite selectivity and high capacity.







Abstract
The quest for effective technologies to reduce SO2 pollution is crucial due to its adverse effects on the environment and human health. Markedly, removing a ppm level of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing waste gas is a persistent challenge, and current technologies suffer from low SO2/CO2 selectivity and energy&#8208;intensive regeneration processes. Here using the molecular building blocks approach and theoretical calculation, we constructed two porous organic polymers (POPs) encompassing pocket&#8208;like structures with exposed imidazole groups, promoting preferential interactions with SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams. Markedly, the evaluated POPs offer outstanding SO2/CO2 selectivity, high SO2 capacity, and an easy regeneration process, making it one of the best materials for SO2 capture. To gain better structural insights into the notable SO2 selectivity of the POPs, we used dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy (DNP) and molecular modelling to probe the interactions between SO2 and POP adsorbents. The newly developed materials are poised to offer an energy&#8208;efficient and environment&#8208;friendly SO2 separation process while we are obliged to use fossil fuels for our energy needs.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Inducible and Photoactivatable Cellular RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Editing</title>

This study combines the CRISPR/dCas13b and chemical induced proximity (CIP) techniques to develop a small molecule&#8208;induced photo&#8208;controllable m1A demethylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A) as well as an m1A methylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;m1A). These m1A editing tools are able to regulate the biological function of targeted RNAs by modulating m1A modifications, which in turn influences cell functions.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at A8422 of MALAT1 RNA, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylation function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.

         <title>Large Libraries of Structurally Diverse Macrocycles Suitable for Membrane Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles are promising for drug development due to their good binding properties and the potential to cross membranes. A synthetic strategy and chemical building blocks are developed to produce and screen thousands of small, structurally highly diverse peptidic macrocycles. HTS identifies potent thrombin inhibitors with good membrane permeability. The strategy may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.







Abstract
Macrocycles offer an attractive format for drug development due to their good binding properties and potential to cross cell membranes. To efficiently identify macrocyclic ligands for new targets, methods for the synthesis and screening of large combinatorial libraries of small cyclic peptides were developed, many of them using thiol groups for efficient peptide macrocyclization. However, a weakness of these libraries is that invariant thiol&#8208;containing building blocks such as cysteine are used, resulting in a region that does not contribute to library diversity but increases molecule size. Herein, we synthesized a series of structurally diverse thiol&#8208;containing elements and used them for the combinatorial synthesis of a 2,688&#8208;member library of small, structurally diverse peptidic macrocycles with unprecedented skeletal complexity. We then used this library to discover potent thrombin and plasma kallikrein inhibitors, some also demonstrating favorable membrane permeability. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of macrocycle&#8208;target complexes showed that the size and shape of the newly developed thiol elements are key for binding. The strategy and library format presented in this work significantly enhance structural diversity by allowing combinatorial modifications to a previously invariant region of peptide macrocycles, which may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.

Constructing Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 supported intermetallic L10&#8722;PtNi NPs via regulating RMSI between Pt and supports as high&#8208;performing ORR catalysts for PEMFCs







Abstract
Developing efficient and anti&#8208;corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance for the applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we report a novel approach to prepare metal oxides supported intermetallic Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) via the reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) as ORR catalysts, using Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 (Ni/ZrO2) supported L10&#8722;PtNi NPs as a proof of concept. Benefiting from the Ni migration during RMSI, the oxygen vacancy concentrations in the support are increased, leading to an electron enrichment of Pt. The optimal L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI catalyst achieves remarkably low mass activity (MA) loss (17.8&#8201;%) after 400,000 accelerated durability test cycles in a half&#8208;cell and exceptional PEMFC performance (MA=0.76&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=1.52/0.92&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2/&#8722;air, and 18.4&#8201;% MA decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles), representing the best reported Pt&#8208;based ORR catalysts without carbon supports. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI requires a lower energetic barrier for ORR than L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2 (direct loading), which is ascribed to a decreased Bader charge transfer between Pt and *OH, and the improved stability of L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI compared to L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;C can be contributed to the increased adhesion energy and Ni vacancy formation energy within the PtNi alloy.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Dynamic Structural Color in a Host&#8208;Guest System for Time&#8208;Dependent Anticounterfeiting and Double&#8208;Lock Encryption</title>

We report a dynamic structural color induced by the difference in the time required for accomplishing the assembly process. This distinctive result opens a door for countless applications in time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and double&#8208;lock encryption.







Abstract
Manipulation of periodic micro/nanostructures in polymer film is of great importance for academics and industrial applications in anticounterfeiting. However, with the increasing demand on information security, materials with time&#8208;dependent features are urgently required, especially the material where the same information can appear more than once on the time scale. Here, one concise strategy to realize time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption based on a host&#8208;guest system is proposed, with one photoresponsive azopolymer as the host and one liquid&#8208;crystalline molecule as the guest. The system exhibits a tunable mass transport in pre&#8208;designed periodic micro/nanostructures by tailoring the process of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans recovery of azo groups and assembly of mesogenic trans&#8208;isomers, resulting in a dynamic structural color in film. Taking advantage of this extraordinary feature, time&#8208;dependent dynamic anticounterfeiting has been achieved. More importantly, the time of each state's appearance in the whole process can be modulated by changing the host&#8208;guest ratio. Combining the manipulatable process of mass transport with the unique decoding method, the stored information in film can be decrypted correctly. This work provides an unprecedented dynamic approach for advanced anticounterfeiting technology with a higher level of security and high&#8208;end applications in information encryption.

         <title>Detection of Sulfoquinovosidase Activity in Cell Lysates Using Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of activity&#8208;based probes targeting the active site nucleophile of glycoside hydrolase family&#8197;31 sulfoquinovosidases is described. The probes are shown to bind covalently by structural biology, mass spectrometry and Cy5 in&#8208;gel fluorescence, are selective for sulfoquinovosidases in whole bacterial cell lysates, and are used to monitor active levels of enzyme over time.







Abstract
The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, constitutes a major sulfur reserve in the biosphere. Microbial breakdown of SQDG is critical for the biological utilization of its sulfur. This commences through release of the parent sugar, sulfoquinovose (SQ), catalyzed by sulfoquinovosidases (SQases). These vanguard enzymes are encoded in gene clusters that code for diverse SQ catabolic pathways. To identify, visualize and isolate glycoside hydrolase CAZY&#8208;family&#8197;31 (GH31) SQases in complex biological environments, we introduce SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). These ABPs label the active site nucleophile of this enzyme family, consistent with specific recognition of the SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine in the active site, as evidenced in the 3D structure of Bacillus megaterium SQase. A fluorescent Cy5&#8208;probe enables visualization of SQases in crude cell lysates from bacteria harbouring different SQ breakdown pathways, whilst a biotin&#8208;probe enables SQase capture and identification by proteomics. The Cy5&#8208;probe facilitates monitoring of active SQase levels during different stages of bacterial growth which show great contrast to more traditional mRNA analysis obtained by RT&#8208;qPCR. Given the importance of SQases in global sulfur cycling and in human microbiota, these SQase ABPs provide a new tool with which to study SQase occurrence, activity and stability.

         <title>An All&#8208;Rounder for NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostics: Well&#8208;Tailored 1064&#8201;nm&#8208;Excitable Molecule for Photothermal Combating of Orthotopic Breast Cancer</title>

A 1064&#8197;nm&#8208;laser&#8208;excitable molecule with balanced radiative and non&#8208;radiative decay is fabricated by molecular engineering. Further work validated excellent trimodal NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FLI)/NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PAI)/photothermal (PTI) imaging and good NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy (PTT) tumor ablation in orthotopic breast cancer mice models with negligible biotoxicity in vivo.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;activated organic photothermal agent that synchronously enables satisfying NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging is highly warranted yet rather challenging on the basis of the overwhelming nonradiative decay. Herein, such an agent, namely TPABT&#8208;TD, was tactfully designed and constructed via employing benzo[c]thiophene moiety as bulky electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge and tailoring the peripheral molecular rotors. Benefitting from its high electron donor&#8211;acceptor strength and finely modulated intramolecular motion, TPABT&#8208;TD simultaneously exhibits ultralong absorption in NIR&#8208;II region, intense fluorescence emission in the NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) region as nanoaggregates, and high photothermal conversion upon 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Those intrinsic advantages endow TPABT&#8208;TD nanoparticles with prominent fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy against orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor with negligible adverse effect.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;Rich Amines by Aminative Carbofunctionalization of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;rich amines by aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compoundsElectrochemical aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compounds was achieved under mild conditions without stringent exclusion of moisture and air. Complementary to existing photochemical methodologies, this catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive approach involves the coupling of cathodically generated nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radicals with suitable radical acceptors, enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted amines with valuable molecular scaffolds.







Abstract
Alkylamines form the backbone of countless nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules possessing desirable biological properties. Despite advances in amine synthesis through transition metal catalysis and photoredox chemistry, multicomponent reactions that leverage inexpensive materials to transform abundant chemical feedstocks into three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;substituted alkylamines bearing complex substitution patterns remain scarce. Here, we report the design of a catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive manifold that merges amines, carbonyl compounds and carbon&#8208;based radical acceptors under ambient conditions without rigorous exclusion of air and moisture. Key to this aminative carbofunctionalization process is the chemoselective generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radical intermediates that readily couple with electrophilic partners, providing straightforward access to architecturally intricate alkylamines and drug&#8208;like scaffolds which are inaccessible by conventional means.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of Formamides from Amines and Bioderived Formyl Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerobic oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable formyl surrogate derived from biobased feedstocks such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde is achieved over C3N4&#8208;supported single CuN4 sites with 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms and much higher turnover frequency (TOF) than noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
Herein we present a new strategy for the oxidative synthesis of formamides from various types of amines and bioderived formyl sources (DHA, GLA and GLCA) and molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant on g&#8208;C3N4 supported Cu catalysts. Combined characterization data from EPR, XAFS, XRD and XPS revealed the formation of single CuN4 sites on supported Cuphen/C3N4 catalysts. EPR spin trapping experiments disclosed &#8901;OOH radicals as reactive oxygen species and &#8901;NR1R2 radicals being responsible for the initial C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Control experiments and DFT calculations showed that the successive C&#8722;C bond cleavage in DHA proceeds via a reaction mechanism co&#8208;mediated by &#8901;NR1R2 and &#8901;OOH radicals based on the well&#8208;equilibrated CuII and CuI cycle. Our catalyst has much higher activity (TOF) than those based on noble metals.

         <title>Delocalizing Excitation for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;phonon coupling in organic photovoltaic materials (2FBP&#8208;4F) was reduced through a rational fluoro&#8208;substituted strategy, promoting exciton delocalization. Polaron pairs and polarons were observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles, facilitating the generation of free charge. 2FBP&#8208;4F exhibited high photocatalytic performance in both single&#8208;component and heterojunction systems.







Abstract
Localized excitation in traditional organic photocatalysts typically prevents the generation and extraction of photo&#8208;induced free charge carriers, limiting their activity enhancement under illumination. Here, we enhance delocalized photoexcitation of small molecular photovoltaic catalysts by weakening their electron&#8208;phonon coupling via rational fluoro&#8208;substitution.

&lt;p&gt;The electron-phonon coupling in organic photovoltaic materials (2FBP-4F) was reduced through a rational fluoro-substituted strategy, promoting exciton delocalization. Polaron pairs and polarons were observed in 2FBP-4F nanoparticles, facilitating the generation of free charge. 2FBP-4F exhibited high photocatalytic performance in both single-component and heterojunction systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localized excitation in traditional organic photocatalysts typically prevents the generation and extraction of photo-induced free charge carriers, limiting their activity enhancement under illumination. Here, we enhance delocalized photoexcitation of small molecular photovoltaic catalysts by weakening their electron-phonon coupling via rational fluoro-substitution. The optimized 2FBP-4F catalyst we develop here exhibits a minimized Huang&#8211;Rhys factor of 0.35 in solution, high dielectric constant and strong crystallization in the solid state. As a result, the energy barrier for exciton dissociation is decreased, and more importantly, polarons are unusually observed in 2FBP-4F nanoparticles (NPs). With the increased hole transfer efficiency and prolonged charge carrier lifetime highly related to enhanced exciton delocalization, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP-4F heterojunction NPs at varied concentration exhibit much higher optimized photocatalytic activity (207.6&#8211;561.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for hydrogen evolution than the control PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BP-4F and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP-6F NPs, as well as other reported photocatalysts under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyfluorinated Organic Diammonium Induced Lead Iodide Arrangement for Efficient Two&#8208;Step&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are developed by incorporating a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt which cann't generate low&#8208;dimensional perovskites into the lead iodide precursor to change the arrangement of the lead iodide crystals. The resulting high&#8208;quality perovskite film with large grain size boost the efficiencies to 24.70&#8201;% and 21.04&#8201;% for cell (0.06&#8197;cm2) and module (100&#8197;cm2), respectively.







Abstract
The inefficient conversion of lead iodide to perovskite has become one of the major challenges in further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the two&#8208;step method. Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP&#8208;PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP&#8208;PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76&#8201;% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04&#8201;% was achieved in a large&#8208;area perovskite module (100&#8197;cm2). Our work provides a unique insight into the function of organic diammonium additive in boosting photovoltaic performance.

         <title>M&#8722;N3 Configuration on Boron Nitride Boosts Singlet Oxygen Generation via Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites have been constructed via a vacancy control and coordination anchoring strategy, which overcome the difficulties in efficient and universal 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), thus achieving impressive selectivity and conversion rate for the transformation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an essential reactive species responsible for selective oxidation of organic matter, especially in Fenton&#8208;like processes. However, due to the great limitations in synthesizing catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites, the controllable production and practical application of 1O2 remain challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical simulations, a series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) were synthesized to regulate 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). All the fabricated BvBN/M catalysts with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites promoted the self&#8208;decomposition of the two PMS molecules to generate 1O2 with high selectivity, where BvBN/Co possessed moderate adsorption energy and d&#8208;band center exhibited superior catalytic activity. As an outcome, the BvBN/Co&#8208;PMS system coupled with membrane filtration technology could continuously transform aromatic alcohols to aldehydes with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity and conversion rate under mild conditions, suggesting the potential of this novel catalytic system for green organic synthesis.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Caged Rhodamine Generating Nitrosoperoxycarbonate for Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and visible light&#8208;triggered ONOOCO2&#8722; donor (NPCD565) was devised. Its photolysis generated a rhodamine dye along with two mild radicals, e.g., NO and CO2.&#8722;. Their further combination with O2 yields ONOOCO2&#8722;, homolysis of which yields two potent radicals NO2 and CO3.&#8722;, which were harnessed to induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells. In mouse models, ablation of the primary tumor and suppression of the distant tumor were achieved.







Abstract
Photoimmunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment modality. While potent 1&#8208;e&#8722; oxidative species are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), they are also associated with unspecific oxidation and collateral tissue damage. This difficulty may be addressed by post&#8208;generation radical reinforcement. Namely, non&#8208;oxidative radicals are first generated and subsequently activated into powerful oxidative radicals to induce ICD. Here, we developed a photo&#8208;triggered molecular donor (NPCD565) of nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2&#8722;), the first of its class to our knowledge, and further evaluated its feasibility for immunotherapy. Upon irradiation of NPCD565 by light within a broad spectral region from ultraviolet to red, ONOOCO2&#8722; is released along with a bright rhodamine dye (RD565), whose fluorescence is a reliable and convenient build&#8208;in reporter for the localization, kinetics, and dose of ONOOCO2&#8722; generation. Upon photolysis of NPCD565 in 4T1 cells, damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of ICD were observed and confirmed to exhibit immunogenicity by induced maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo studies with a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model showcased the potent tumor&#8208;killing capability of NPCD565 of the primary tumors and growth suppression of the distant tumors. This work unveils the potent immunogenicity of ONOOCO2&#8722;, and its donor (NPCD565) has broad potential for photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>Single Crystal and Pentatwinned Gold Nanorods Result in Chiral Nanocrystals with Reverse Handedness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

The handedness of chiral gold nanorods synthesized by seeded growth typically follows that of the organic chiral inducer, being right&#8208;handed when templated by S&#8208;BINAMINE micelles or induced by L&#8208;cystine (L&#8208;2cys). Our results demonstrate that a change in the achiral seed, from single crystalline to pentatwinned, can reverse the sign of circular dichroism (CD) measurements, adding a new effect to guide the chirality of gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Handedness is an essential attribute of chiral nanocrystals, having a major influence on their properties. During chemical growth, the handedness of nanocrystals is usually tuned by selecting the corresponding enantiomer of chiral molecules involved in asymmetric growth, often known as chiral inducers. We report that, even using the same chiral inducer enantiomer, the handedness of chiral gold nanocrystals can be reversed by using Au nanorod seeds with either single crystalline or pentatwinned structure. This effect holds for chiral growth induced both by amino acids and by chiral micelles. Although it was challenging to discern the morphological handedness for L&#8208;cystine&#8208;directed particles, even using electron tomography, both cases showed circular dichroism bands of opposite sign, with nearly mirrored chiroptical signatures for chiral micelle&#8208;directed growth, along with quasi&#8208;helical wrinkles of inverted handedness. These results expand the chiral growth toolbox with an effect that might be exploited to yield a host of interesting morphologies with tunable optical properties.

         <title>An Expedient Radical Approach for the Decarboxylative Synthesis of Stereodefined All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>

         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;based, photo&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative formation of stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins is reported using various &#945;&#8208;amino radical precursors and heterocycles as substrates. This user&#8208;friendly protocol combines a wide structural scope, easy drug and postsynthetic manipulations, and variation in both reaction partners. The mechanistic studies reveal a key CO2 extrusion step to enable the overall transformation.







Abstract
We report a user&#8208;friendly approach for the decarboxylative formation of stereodefined and complex tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted olefins from vinyl cyclic carbonates and amines as radical precursors. The protocol relies on easy photo&#8208;initiated &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;radical formation followed by addition onto the double bond of the substrate resulting in a sequence involving carbonate ring&#8208;opening, double bond relay, CO2 extrusion and finally O&#8208;protonation. The developed protocol is efficient for both mismatched and matched polarity substrate combinations, and the scope of elaborate stereodefined olefins that can be forged including drug&#8208;functionalized derivatives is wide, diverse and further extendable to other types of heterocyclic and radical precursors. Mechanistic control reactions show that the decarboxylation step is a key driving force towards product formation, with the initial radical addition under steric control.

         <title>Efficient Ultraviolet Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Cerium Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance UV&#8208;CPL is proposed by constructing Ce3+&#8208;based 0D chiral HMHs. R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 show large |glum| values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2 and FM values of (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which is superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL active materials. The UV CP light from the fabricated CP&#8208;LEDs can trigger enantioselective photopolymerizations of diacetylene and yield polymerized products with anisotropy factors of CD up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2.







Abstract
Ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (UV&#8208;CPL) with high photon energy shows great potential in polarized light sources and stereoselective photopolymerization. However, developing luminescent materials with high UV&#8208;CPL performance remains challenging. Here, we report a pair of rare earth Ce3+&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7, which exhibits characteristic UV emissions derived from the Ce 5d&#8211;4f transition. The compounds show simultaneously high photoluminescent quantum yields of (32&#8211;39)% and large luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum|) values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2. Thus, the figures of merits of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 are calculated to be (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which are superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL emissive materials. Additionally, nearly 91&#8201;% of their PL intensities at 300&#8197;K can be well preserved at 380&#8197;K (LED operating temperature) without phase transition or decomposition, demonstrating the excellent structural and optical thermal stabilities of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7. Based on these enantiomers, the fabricated UV&#8208;emitting CP&#8208;LEDs exhibit high polarization degrees of &#177;1.0&#8201;%. Notably, the UV&#8208;CPL generated from the devices can significantly trigger the enantioselective photopolymerization of diacetylene with remarkable stereoselectivity, and consequently yield polymerized products with the anisotropy factors of circular dichroism (gCD) up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2, outperforming other UV&#8208;CPL materials and demonstrating their great potential as UV&#8208;polarized light sources.

         <title>Isothermal Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals Driven by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal phase transitions via dynamic covalent chemistry have been unlocked in nematic arrays. A nematic aldehyde was on&#8208;surface treated with various amines, triggering diverse phase transitions driven by imination reactions. The unlocking of these new adaptable liquid crystal systems paves the way for the conception of programmable structural pathways and new materials capable of evolving by chemical stimuli and temperature modulation.







Abstract
The dynamic nature of calamitic liquid crystals is exploited to perform isothermal phase transitions driven by dynamic covalent chemistry. For this purpose, nematic (N) arrays based on aldehyde 1 were treated with different amines (A&#8211;E) in an on&#8208;surface process, which resulted in different isothermal phase transitions. These phase transformations were caused by in situ imination reactions and are dependent on the nature of the added amine. Transitions from the N to crystal (1A, 1E), isotropic (1B), and smectic (Sm) (1C, 1D) phases were achieved, while the resulting materials feature thermotropic liquid crystal behavior. A sequential transformation from the N 1 to the Sm 1C and then to the N 1B was achieved by coupling an imination to a transimination processes and adjusting the temperature. All of these processes were well characterized by microscopic, spectroscopic, and X&#8208;ray techniques, unlocking not only the constitutional but also the structural aspects of the phase transitions. This work provides new insights into designing constitutionally and structurally adaptable liquid crystal systems, paving the way toward the conception of programable evolutive pathways and adaptive materials.

         <title>Discovery of (&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes Reveals an Unusual Indole Ring Cleavage Pathway Catalyzed by P450 Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel enantiomeric natural indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton were isolated from a mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus. The cytochrome P450 enzyme was identified to catalyze the C2&#8722;C3 double bond cleavage of indole ring to generate products with two keto groups during the biosynthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactam indole terpenoids. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase.

(&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes A&#8722;D (1&#8211;4), the first representatives of indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton, were isolated from the mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus Penicillium brocae MA&#8208;231. Our bioactivity tests revealed their potent antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The biosynthetic reactions by the five enzymes PbaABCDE leading to &#947;&#8208;lactam ring formation were identified with heterologous expression and in vitro enzymatic assays. Remarkably, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PbaB and its homolog in Aspergillus oryzae catalyzed the 2,3&#8208;cleavage of the indole ring to generate two keto groups in 1. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase. In addition, rare secondary amide bond formation by the glutamine synthetase&#8208;like enzyme PbaD was reported. These findings will contribute to the engineered biosynthesis of unnatural, bioactive indole terpenoids.

&lt;p&gt;Novel enantiomeric natural indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;-lactam skeleton were isolated from a mangrove-derived endophytic fungus. The cytochrome P450 enzyme was identified to catalyze the C2&#8722;C3 double bond cleavage of indole ring to generate products with two keto groups during the biosynthesis of &#947;-lactam indole terpenoids. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Crystal Structures of Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals through Trace Cadmium(II) Doping for Efficient Color&#8208;Saturated Green LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace Cd2+ doping into FAPbBr3 nanocrystals leads to the increase of exciton effective mass due to the slight perovskite octahedra distortion. Benefiting from enhanced exciton binding energy and almost unchanged Auger recombination rate, a highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% and 534&#8197;nm emission wavelength has been obtained.







Abstract
Decreasing perovskite nanocrystal size increases radiative recombination due to the quantum confinement effect, but also increases the Auger recombination rate which leads to carrier imbalance in the emitting layers of electroluminescent devices. Here, we overcome this trade&#8208;off by increasing the exciton effective mass without affecting the size, which is realized through the trace Cd2+ doping of formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals. We observe an ~2.7&#8197;times increase in the exciton binding energy benefiting from a slight distortion of the [BX6]4&#8722; octahedra caused by doping in the case of that the Auger recombination rate is almost unchanged. As a result, bright color&#8208;saturated green emitting perovskite nanocrystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are obtained. Cd2+ doping also shifts up the energy levels of the nanocrystals, relative to the Fermi level so that heavily n&#8208;doped emitters convert into only slightly n&#8208;doped ones; this boosts the charge injection efficiency of the corresponding light&#8208;emitting diodes. The light&#8208;emitting devices based on those nanocrystals reached a high external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% corresponding to a current efficiency of 123&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and showed dramatically improved device lifetime, with a narrow bandwidth of 22&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage coordinates of (0.20, 0.76) for color&#8208;saturated green emission for the electroluminescence peak centered at 534&#8197;nm, thus being fully compliant with the latest standard for wide color gamut displays.

         <title>Rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery for hydrogen storage and production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop process for H2 storage and production using Zn as an electron carrier to combine a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery to generate H2 and an alkaline electrolyzer to regenerate Zn. The Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using cheap renewable energy and produce H2 on demand more than 600&#8197;times.







Abstract
Reactive metals hydrolysis offers significant advantages for hydrogen storage and production. However, the regeneration of common reactive metals (e.g., Mg, Al, etc.) is energy&#8208;intensive and produces unwanted byproducts such as CO2 and Cl2. Herein, we employ Zn as a reactive mediator that can be easily regenerated by electrolysis of ZnO in an alkaline solution with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. H2 is produced in the same electrolyte by constructing a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery consisting of a Zn anode and a Raney&#8208;Ni cathode to unlock the Zn&#8208;H2O reaction. The entire two&#8208;step water splitting reaction with a net energy efficiency of 70.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using renewable energy to produce H2 on demand and runs for 600 cycles only sacrificing 3.76&#8201;% energy efficiency. DFT calculations reveal that the desorption of H* on Raney&#8208;Ni (&#8722;0.30&#8197;eV) is closer to zero compared with that on Zn (&#8722;0.87&#8197;eV), indicating a faster desorption of H* at low overpotential. Further, a 24&#8197;Ah electrolyzer is demonstrated to produce H2 with a net energy efficiency of 65.5&#8201;%, which holds promise for its real application.

         <title>Unprecedented POSS&#8208;Linked 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with 2&#8208;Fold Interpenetrated scu or sqc Topology Regulated by Porphyrin Center for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topology of unprecedented POSS&#8208;linked 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been revealed to show dependence on the central ions of porphyrin building block. Central metal ions of Co(II) and Zn(II) in porphyrin building block result in the formation of POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with scu topology, while metal free and Ni central ions lead to POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with symmetric sqc topology. The well&#8208;distributed porphyrin units in these COFs endow them with enhanced performance in both photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and photocatalytic production of artemisinin.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of porphyrin center regulated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated scu or sqc topology have been investigated. These COFs exhibit unique structural features and properties, making them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications in CO2 reduction and artemisinin synthesis. The porphyrin center serves as an anchor for metal ions, allowing precise control over structures and functions of the frameworks. Furthermore, the metal coordination within the framework imparts desirable catalytic properties, enabling their potential use in photocatalytic reactions. Overall, these porphyrin center regulated metal&#8208;controlled COFs offer exciting opportunities for the development of advanced materials with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Ratiometric Afterglow Luminescent Imaging of Matrix Metalloproteinase&#8208;2 Activity via an Energy Diversion Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MMP&#8208;2&#8208;activated and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;targeting ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) nanoprobe RAG&#8208;RGD is reported, which is constructed in adoption of energy diversion (ED) of excited&#8208;state afterglow substrate (AG&#8208;8*) and cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process.







Abstract
Ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) probes are attractive for in vivo imaging due to their high sensitivity and signal self&#8208;calibration function. However, there are currently few ratiometric AGL probes available for imaging enzymatic activity in living organisms. Here, we present an energy diversion (ED) strategy that enables the design of an enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric AGL probe (RAG&#8208;RGD) for in vivo afterglow imaging. The ED process provides RAG&#8208;RGD with a radiative transition for an &#8216;always on&#8217; 520&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL520) and a cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process for an &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; 710&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL710) in response to a specific enzyme. Using matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) as an example, RAG&#8208;RGD shows a significant ~11&#8208;fold increase in AGL710/AGL520 toward MMP&#8208;2. This can sensitively detect U87MG brain tumors through ratiometric afterglow imaging of MMP&#8208;2 activity, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep imaging depth. Furthermore, by utilizing the self&#8208;calibration effect of ratiometric imaging, RAG&#8208;RGD demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the AGL710/AGL520 value and the size of orthotopic U87MG tumor, enabling accurate monitoring of orthotopic glioma growth in vivo. This ED process may be applied for the design of other enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric afterglow probes for sensitive afterglow imaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) probes are attractive for in vivo imaging due to their high sensitivity and signal self-calibration function. However, there are currently few ratiometric AGL probes available for imaging enzymatic activity in living organisms. Here, we present an energy diversion (ED) strategy that enables the design of an enzyme-activated ratiometric AGL probe (RAG-RGD) for in vivo afterglow imaging. The ED process provides RAG-RGD with a radiative transition for an &#8216;always on&#8217; 520-nm AGL signal (AGL&lt;sub&gt;520&lt;/sub&gt;) and a cascade three-step energy transfer (ET) process for an &#8216;off-on&#8217; 710-nm AGL signal (AGL&lt;sub&gt;710&lt;/sub&gt;) in response to a specific enzyme. Using matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) as an example, RAG-RGD shows a significant ~11-fold increase in AGL&lt;sub&gt;710&lt;/sub&gt;/AGL&lt;sub&gt;520&lt;/sub&gt; toward MMP-2. This can sensitively detect U87MG brain tumors through ratiometric afterglow imaging of MMP-2 activity, with a high signal-to-background ratio and deep imaging depth. Furthermore, by utilizing the self-calibration effect of ratiometric imaging, RAG-RGD demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the AGL&lt;sub&gt;710&lt;/sub&gt;/AGL&lt;sub&gt;520&lt;/sub&gt; value and the size of orthotopic U87MG tumor, enabling accurate monitoring of orthotopic glioma growth in vivo. This ED process may be applied for the design of other enzyme-activated ratiometric afterglow probes for sensitive afterglow imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cascade Dearomatization of Indoles via a Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Bisfunctionalization of Butadienes</title>

Herein, a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes has been disclosed. This process delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er).







Abstract
Photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed bisfunctionalization of butadienes with a readily available organic halide and a nucleophile represents an emerging and attractive method to assemble versatile alkenes bearing various functional groups at the allylic position. However, enantiocontrol and/or diastereocontrol in the C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bond&#8208;formation step have not been solved due to the open&#8208;shell process. Herein, we present a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoexcited Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes, wherein asymmetric control on both the nucleophile and electrophile part is achieved for the first time in photoinduced bisfunctionalization of butadienes. This method delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Experimental and computational studies of the mechanism have confirmed a radical pathway involving excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. The alignment and non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and the catalyst were found to be essential for stereocontrol.

         <title>Self&#8208;Inclusion Complexation of Electron&#8208;Accepting Guest into Electron&#8208;Donating Cyclic Host by Photoexcitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

Pillar[5]arene bearing a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety exhibited dual locally excited and exciplex emissions from out&#8208;state and in&#8208;state, respectively, in the excited state. The addition of guest molecules suppressed formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state, resulting in observation of the single locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state.







Abstract
Self&#8208;inclusion complexes consisting of host&#8208;guest conjugates are one of the unique supramolecular structures because they form in&#8208;state and out&#8208;state depending on the external stimuli. Despite many reports of the stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;inclusion complex formation, study of the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation has been unexplored. Herein, we report that an electron&#8208;donating host and an electron&#8208;accepting guest conjugate exhibits the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation. Formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state resulted in exciplex emission along with the locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state. Moreover, this structural relaxation by photoexcitation was suppressed not only by temperature, but also by the presence of guest molecules, resulting in changes in the ratio of the dual emission intensities.

Selective synthesis of C=N and C&#8722;N bonds was facilely achieved by manipulating the solvents via hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated transfer hydrogenation process over CdS photocatalyst.







Abstract
Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds and nitro compounds represents a straightforward way to attain imines or secondary amines, but it is difficult to control the product selectivity. Herein, we report the selective formation of C&#8722;N or C=N bond readily manipulated through a solvent&#8208;induced hydrogen bond bridge, facilitating the swift photocatalytic reductive coupling process. The reductive&#8208;coupling of nitro compounds with carbonyl compounds using formic acid and sodium formate as the hydrogen donors over CdS nanosheets selectively generates imines with C=N bonds in acetonitrile solvent; while taking methanol as solvent, the C=N bonds are readily hydrogenated to the C&#8722;N bonds via hydrogen&#8208;bonding activation. Experimental and theoretical study reveals that the building of the hydrogen&#8208;bond bridge between the hydroxyl groups in methanol and the N atoms of the C=N motifs in imines facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms from CdS surface to the N atoms in imines upon illumination, resulting in the rapid hydrogenation of the C=N bonds to give rise to the secondary amines with C&#8722;N bonds. Our method provides a simple way to control product selectivity by altering the solvents in photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Enables Flexible&#8208;Robust Porosity for Highly Efficient Purification of Natural Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel flexible&#8208;robust HOF material with abundant supramolecular entanglements by weak intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds, enabling the construction of flexible&#8208;robust porosity to be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules for notably improving the C3H8/CH4 and n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 separation performance.







Abstract
The development of porous materials with flexible&#8208;robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a) with flexible&#8208;robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a features a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure with dia topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could not only stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility due to its weak intermolecular interactions (so&#8208;called flexible&#8208;robust framework). The flexible&#8208;robust porosity of ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a was exclusively confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules rather by C2H6 and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6 over CH4 under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 selectivities. The gas&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n&#8208;C4H10 can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n&#8208;C4H10 uptake and selectivity, while not for C2H6 adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible&#8208;robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.

&lt;p&gt;We reported a novel flexible-robust HOF material with abundant supramolecular entanglements by weak intermolecular hydrogen-bonds, enabling the construction of flexible-robust porosity to be opened by C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; molecules for notably improving the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of porous materials with flexible-robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl-based hydrogen-bonded organic framework (ZJU-HOF-8a) with flexible-robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU-HOF-8a features a four-fold interpenetrated structure with &lt;i&gt;dia&lt;/i&gt; topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could not only stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility due to its weak intermolecular interactions (so-called flexible-robust framework). The flexible-robust porosity of ZJU-HOF-8a was exclusively confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; molecules rather by C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This leads to notably higher C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivities. The gas-loaded single-crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and selectivity, while not for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible-robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Iminium stencil. A cyclometallated imide exhibits a unique mode of action serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines. A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop the most selective and active catalysts described to date for the direct hydrogenation of this challenging class of substrates with up to 99&#8201;% ee and 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF.







Abstract
A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop overall the most selective catalyst for the direct hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl imines described to date. Iridium catalysts with a cyclometallated cyclic imide group provide selectivity of up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Computational studies show that the selectivity results from the combined effect of H&#8208;bonding of the imide C=O with the substrate iminium ion and a stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with the cyclometallated ligand. The cyclometallated ligand thus exhibits a unique mode of action, serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate which results in enhanced selectivity. The catalyst (2) has been synthesized and isolated as a crystalline air&#8208;stable solid. X&#8208;ray analysis of 2 confirmed the structure of the catalyst and the correct position of the imide C=O groups to engage in an H&#8208;bond with the substrate. 19F&#8197;NMR real&#8208;time monitoring showed the hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines catalyzed by 2 is very fast, with a TOF of approx. 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Micelles Cascade Assembly to Tandem Porous Catalyst for Waste Plastics Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle cascade assembly strategy is developed for synthesizing a tandem porous catalyst with hierarchical porous and acidic structures, which mimics natural protease catalytic clefts, exhibiting a high catalytic activity, selectivity and resistance to coking for the catalytic cracking of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) at a low temperature.







Abstract
Catalytic upcycling of polyolefins into high&#8208;value chemicals represents the direction in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization, but poses great challenges. Here, we report the synthesis of a tandem porous catalyst via a micelle cascade assembly strategy for selectively catalytic cracking of polyethylene into olefins at a low temperature. A hierarchically porous silica layer from mesopore to macropore is constructed on the surface of microporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanosheets through cascade assembly of dynamic micelles. The outer macropore arrays can adsorb bulky polyolefins quickly by the capillary and hydrophobic effects, enhancing the diffusion and access to active sites. The middle mesopores present a nanoconfinement space, pre&#8208;cracking polyolefins into intermediates by weak acid sites, which then transport into zeolites micropores for further cracking by strong Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The hierarchically porous and acidic structures, mimicking biomimetic protease catalytic clefts, ideally match the tandem cracking steps of polyolefins, thus suppressing coke formation and facilitating product escape. As a result, light hydrocarbons (C1&#8208;C7) are produced with a yield of 443&#8197;mmol&#8201;gZSM&#8208;5&#8722;1, where 74.3&#8201;% of them are C3&#8208;C6 olefins, much superior to ZSM&#8208;5 and porous silica catalysts. This tandem porous catalyst exemplifies a superstructure design of catalytic cracking catalysts for industrial and economical upcycling of plastic wastes.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with a Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Topology and High Electrical Conductance</title>

         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D conductive MOFs (named M&#8211;DHHBTN, M=Co, Ni, and Cu) with a unique ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring topology has been successfully constructed by using a highly branched and conjugated dodechydroxyhexabenzotrinaphthylene ligand, which offers the first example simultaneously achieving high electron conductivity and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;pore structure in 2D MOFs.







Abstract
Electrically conducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable structural tunability and outstanding electrical properties. However, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials face challenges due to the limited availability of specific ligands and pore structures. In this study, we have employed a novel highly branched D3h symmetrical planar conjugated ligand, dodechydroxylhexabenzotrinaphthylene (DHHBTN) to fabricate a series of 2D conductive MOFs, named M&#8211;DHHBTN (M=Co, Ni, and Cu). This new family of MOFs offers two distinct types of pores, elevating the structural complexity of 2D conductive MOFs to a more advanced level. The intricate tessellation patterns of the M&#8211;DHHBTN are elucidated through comprehensive analyses involving powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical simulations, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope. Optical&#8208;pump terahertz&#8208;probe spectroscopic measurements unveiled carrier mobility in DHHBTN&#8208;based 2D MOFs spanning from 0.69 to 3.10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Among M&#8211;DHHBTN famility, Cu&#8208;DHHBTN displayed high electrical conductivity reaching 0.21&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K with thermal activation behavior. This work leverages the &#8220;branched conjugation&#8221; of the ligand to encode heteroporosity into highly conductive 2D MOFs, underscoring the significant potential of heterogeneous double&#8208;pore structures for future applications.

Single crystals of a functional covalent organic polymer (COP, CityU&#8208;25) containing dative B&#8592;N bonds have been successfully prepared and their structure has been solved through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. CityU&#8208;25 as an anode in rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries displayed an excellent performance, evidenced by an impressive capacity of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g.







Abstract
Inspired by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds proven to be the promising dynamic linkage for the construction of crystalline covalent organic polymers/frameworks (COPs/COFs), we employed 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) benzene (BACT) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (DPNTCDI) as the corresponding building blocks to construct a functional COP (named as CityU&#8208;25), which had been employed as an anode in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. CityU&#8208;25 displayed an excellent reversible lithium storage capability of 455&#8197;mAh/g after 170 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A/g, and an impressive one of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g. These findings suggest that CityU&#8208;25 is a standout candidate for advanced battery technologies, highlighting the potential application of this type of materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient One&#8208;pot Electrosynthesis of Oxime Ethers from NOx over Ultrafine MgO Nanoparticles Derived from Mg&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

A novel tandem electrochemical system for converting exhaust NOx into oxime ether is proposed and presents great efficiency over a developed MgO derived from MOF anchoring in nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance of NOx valorization to synthesize organonitrogen drug molecules in a sustainable and mild way.







Abstract
Oxime ethers are attractive compounds in medicinal scaffolds due to the biological and pharmaceutical properties, however, the crucial and widespread step of industrial oxime formation using explosive hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is insecure and troublesome. Herein, we present a convenient method of oxime ether synthesis in a one&#8208;pot tandem electrochemical system using magnesium based metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived magnesium oxide anchoring in self&#8208;supporting carbon nanofiber membrane catalyst (MgO&#8208;SCM), the in situ produced NH2OH from nitrogen oxides electrocatalytic reduction coupled with aldehyde to produce 4&#8208;cyanobenzaldoxime with a selectivity of 93&#8201;% and Faraday efficiency up to 65.1&#8201;%, which further reacted with benzyl bromide to directly give oxime ether precipitate with a purity of 97&#8201;% by convenient filtering separation. The high efficiency was attributed to the ultrafine MgO nanoparticles in MgO&#8208;SCM, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerating the production of NH2OH, which rapidly attacked carbonyl of aldehydes to form oximes, but hardly crossed the hydrogenation barrier of forming amines, thus leading to a high yield of oxime ether when coupling benzyl bromide nucleophilic reaction. This work highlights the importance of kinetic control in complex electrosynthetic organonitrogen system and demonstrates a green and safe alternative method for synthesis of organic nitrogen drug molecules.

         <title>Cyclodextrin &#8216;Chaperones&#8217; Enable Quasi&#8208;Ideal Supramolecular Network Formation and Enhanced Photodimerization of Hydrophobic, Red&#8208;shifted Photoswitches in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrines serve as chaperones to solubilize and pre&#8208;order hydrophobic photoswitches with red&#8208;shifted activation wavelength in water, providing unique access to higher reactivity on a molecular scale and quasi&#8208;ideal hydrogel networks without phase segregation on the macroscale.







Abstract
Precision&#8208;engineered light&#8208;triggered hydrogels are important for a diversity of applications. However, fields such as biomaterials require wavelength outside the harsh UV regime to prevent photodamage, typically requiring chromophores with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation that suffer from poor water solubility. Herein, we demonstrate how cyclodextrins can be used as auxiliary agents to not only solubilize such chromophores, but even to preorganize them in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest inclusion complex to facilitate photodimerization. We apply our concept to styrylpyrene&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized star&#8208;shaped polyethylene glycols (sPEGs). We initially unravel details of the host&#8208;guest inclusion complex using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to give clear evidence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the resultant supramolecularly linked hydrogels conform to theories of supramolecular quasi&#8208;ideal model networks, and derive details on their association dynamics using in&#8208;depth rheological measurements and kinetic models. By comparing sPEGs of different arm length, we further elucidate the model network topology and the accessible mechanical property space. The photo&#8208;mediated dimerization proceeds smoothly, allowing to transform the supramolecular model networks into covalent ones. We submit that our strategy opens avenues for executing hydrophobic photochemistry in aqueous environments with enhanced control over reactivity, hydrogel topology or programmable mechanical properties.

         <title>Linker Mediated Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Conjugated Organic Polymers Enabling Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A viable linker engineering strategy is developed to construct a series of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers wrapped onto CNTs (CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) as pyrolysis&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By altering the electronic properties of organic linkers, the optimal CNTs@bTDA&#8208;CoPc&#8208;CPs confers outstanding performance for the ORR and zinc&#8208;air batteries, representing the high performance among reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts to date.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers with tailorable composition and microarchitecture are propitious for modulating catalytic properties and deciphering inherent structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we report a facile linker engineering strategy to manipulate the electronic states of metallophthalocyanine conjugated polymers and uncover the vital role of organic linkers in facilitating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, a set of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers (CoPc&#8208;CPs) wrapped onto carbon nanotubes (denoted CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) are judiciously crafted via in situ assembling square&#8208;planar cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoPc(NH2)4) with different linear aromatic dialdehyde&#8208;based organic linkers in the presence of CNTs. Intriguingly, upon varying the electronic characteristic of organic linkers from terephthalaldehyde (TA) to 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxaldehyde (TDA) and then to thieno/thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxaldehyde (bTDA), their corresponding CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs exhibit gradually improved electrocatalytic ORR performance. More importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer from CoPc units to electron&#8208;withdrawing linkers (i.e., TDA and bTDA) drives the delocalization of Co d&#8208;orbital electrons, thereby downshifting the Co d&#8208;band energy level. Accordingly, the active Co centers with more positive valence state exhibit optimized binding energy toward ORR&#8208;relevant intermediates and thus a balanced adsorption/desorption pathway that endows significant enhancement in electrocatalytic ORR. This work demonstrates a molecular&#8208;level engineering route for rationally designing efficient polymer catalysts and gaining insightful understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms.

         <title>An Integrative Chemical Recycling Approach for Catalytic Oxidation of Epoxy Resin and in situ Separation of Degraded Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new recycling strategy integrating catalytic oxidation of epoxy resin and in situ separation of degraded products is developed, where the interaction between iron catalyst and reaction solvent makes the degradation under mild condition, while the supramolecular interactions between degraded products and iron catalyst contribute to the separation of mixed degraded products, which provides new ideas for upcycling of mixed plastic wastes.







Abstract
Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on FeIV=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl2 with reaction reagents. As the FeIV=O radicals attacked the C&#8722;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the FeIV=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high&#8208;value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.

&lt;p&gt;A new recycling strategy integrating catalytic oxidation of epoxy resin and in situ separation of degraded products is developed, where the interaction between iron catalyst and reaction solvent makes the degradation under mild condition, while the supramolecular interactions between degraded products and iron catalyst contribute to the separation of mixed degraded products, which provides new ideas for upcycling of mixed plastic wastes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with reaction reagents. As the Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O radicals attacked the C&#8722;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high-value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields via Molecular Symmetry Modulation in Supramolecular Photocatalysts for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the power of symmetry breaking, our supramolecular photocatalyst showcases outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and quantum yield. Our study not only positions SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ among the top performers in organic semiconductor photocatalysts but also demonstrates the method's effectiveness in boosting the efficiency of other catalysts, contributing to the advancement of solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are attractive photocatalysts, but their quantum yields are limited by poor charge separation and transportation. A promising strategy for efficient charge transfer is to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field by symmetry breaking. Herein, an unsymmetric protonation, N&#8208;heterocyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ was developed. The unsymmetric protonation breaks the initial structural symmetry of DADK, resulting in ca. 50&#8208;fold increase in the molecular dipole, and facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer within SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+. The protonation process also creates numerous active sites for H2O adsorption, and serves as crucial proton relays, significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency. Remarkably, SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ exhibits an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 278.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm, placing it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances in organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, the versatility of the unsymmetric protonation approach has been successfully applied to four other photocatalysts, enhancing their photocatalytic performance by 39 to 533&#8197;times. These findings highlight the considerable potential of unsymmetric protonation induced symmetry breaking strategy in tailoring supramolecular photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel production.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamidation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Azides: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic protocol to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under mild conditions. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) pathway in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical.







Abstract
The construction of C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds via direct N&#8208;centered radical addition with olefins under benign conditions is a desirable but challenging strategy. Herein, we describe an organo&#8208;photocatalytic approach to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. A broad range of substrates, including both activated and unactivated alkenes, are suitable for this protocol, providing a convenient and practical method to construct sulfonylamide derivatives. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests that the additive, Hantzsch ester (HE), might undergo a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer manner to achieve photosensitization by the organo&#8208;photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Next, the resulted triplet excited state 3HE* could lead to a homolytic cleavage of C4&#8722;H bond, which triggers a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) style in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical. Subsequently, the addition of the amidyl radical to alkene followed by HAT from p&#8208;toluenethiol could proceed to afford the desired anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation product. It is worth noting that mechanistic pathway bifurcation could be possible for this reaction. A feasible radical chain propagation mechanistic pathway is also proposed to rationalize the high efficiency of this reaction.

         <title>Coral&#8208;Inspired Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Bi&#8208;Stealth Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative coral&#8208;structure inspired multi&#8208;scale composite foam has been successfully fabricated, pioneering the development of terahertz&#8208;infrared bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin. This bi&#8208;stealth system exhibits intelligent electromagnetic protection through autonomous perception, adapting to diverse operational environments and task demands with real&#8208;time responsiveness. Concurrently, it achieves infrared stealth with dynamic ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The development of electronic skin with dual stealth functionality is crucial for enabling devices to operate effectively in dynamic electromagnetic environments, thereby facilitating intelligent electromagnetic protection for autonomous perception. However, achieving compatibility between terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) stealth technologies remains largely unexplored due to their inherent contradictions. Herein, inspired by natural corals, a novel coral&#8208;like multi&#8208;scale composite foam (CMSF) was proposed that ingeniously reconciles these contradictions. The design capitalizes on the conductive network and heat insulation properties of the foam skeleton, the loss effects and low infrared emission of metal particles, and the infrared transparency of magneto&#8208;optical materials. This approach leads to the realization of a THz&#8208;IR bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin concept. The CMSF exhibits a maximum reflection loss of 84.8&#8197;dB in the terahertz band, while its infrared stealth capability ensures environmental adaptability under varying temperatures. Furthermore, the electronic skin exhibits exceptional sensitivity and reliability as a wearable device for perceiving environmental changes. This advanced material, combining multispectral stealth with sensing capabilities, holds immense potential for applications ranging from camouflage technology to smart wearables.

         <title>Desulfurdioxidative N&#8208;N Coupling of N&#8208;Arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;Sulfinylanilines: Reaction Development and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a novel and practical strategy for N&#8722;N bond construction. The strategy involves an unprecedented intermolecular cascade O&#8208;sulfination and desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling (via stepwise retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition, supported by quantum chemistry calculations) from readily available N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines under metal and oxidant free conditions.







Abstract
A highly efficient and chemoselective approach for the divergent assembling of unsymmetrical hydrazines through an unprecedented intermolecular desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling is developed. This metal free protocol employs readily accessible N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines to provide highly valuable hydrazine products with good reaction yields and excellent functional group tolerance under simple conditions. Computational studies suggest that the in situ generated O&#8208;sulfenylated arylhydroxylamine intermediate undergoes a retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition via a stepwise diradical mechanism to form the N&#8722;N bond and release SO2.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Unconventional Phase Alloy Nanobranches for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize unconventional phase Ir&#8208;based alloy nanostrucrtures. Notably, hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi nanobranches demonstrate superior catalytic performance towards ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrite over the conventional phase counterpart. Mechanism studies reveal that Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to the highly selective formation of ammonia.







Abstract
The controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials with unconventional phases is of significant importance to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for various applications. However, it remains challenging to modulate the atomic arrangements of metal nanomaterials, especially the alloy nanostructures that involve different metals with distinct redox potentials. Here we report the general one&#8208;pot synthesis of IrNi, IrRhNi and IrFeNi alloy nanobranches with unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase. Notably, the as&#8208;synthesized hcp IrNi nanobranches demonstrate excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR), with superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.2&#8201;% and 34.6&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (75.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1) at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to a stronger reaction trend of NO2RR by greatly reducing energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining step.

Enantiopure irida[6]helicenes combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment are obtained by dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile [4]helicenic ligands. These compounds exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals, as described by Carlos M. Cruz, Fernando P. Coss&#237;o, Zoraida Freixa, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202406663).

         <title>Quantitative Factors Introduced in the Feasibility Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Sensitive Triggers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Success of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) triggered prodrug activation relies on two key functions: (1) sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and the intended site of delivery, (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of payload release. Herein, we examine ROS concentrations under various pathophysiological conditions and critically analyze ROS&#8208;triggered prodrug.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for cellular signaling. Various pathophysiological conditions are also associated with elevated levels of ROS. Hence, ROS&#8208;sensitive triggers have been extensively used for selective payload delivery. Such applications are predicated on two key functions: (1) a sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and intended sites and (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity for payload release. Further, ROS refers to a group of species with varying reactivity, which should not be viewed as a uniform group. In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS&#8208;sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS&#8208;triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.

         <title>Reaction Environment Regulation for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes, focusing on engineering reaction environments. It discusses strategies for electrocatalyst design, electrode modification, and electrolyte optimization to enhance CO2RR while suppressing hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.

         <title>The 18F&#8208;Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

This Minireview summarises the progress radiochemists have made to access the difluoromethyl group in radiolabelled form. Particular attention is given to challenges they have faced, as well as the strategies employed to access this new radiochemical space.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user&#8208;friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access 18F&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on 18F&#8208;fluorination. A second approach consists of a 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation process, which uses 18F&#8208;labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [18F]CF2H radical or [18F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [18F]CF2H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.

Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorination. A second approach consists of a &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-difluoromethylation process, which uses &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H radical or [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Chemistry has the potential to drive global sustainability efforts, but how to ensure its optimal impact is not always obvious. Through analysis of green, circular, and sustainable chemistry concepts, this Scientific Perspective identifies unified triple&#8197;E priorities, covering environmental, economic, and equity pillars, and categorizes associated metrics. Case studies illustrate how these can be used to guide research and decisions.







Abstract
Chemistry, a vital tool for sustainable development, faces a challenge due to the lack of clear guidance on actionable steps, hindering the optimal adoption of sustainability practices across its diverse facets from discovery to implementation. This Scientific Perspective explores established frameworks and principles, proposing a conciliated set of triple&#8197;E priorities anchored on Environmental, Economic, and Equity pillars for research and decision making. We outline associated metrics, crucial for quantifying impacts, classifying them according to their focus areas and scales tackled. Emphasizing catalysis as a key driver of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and materials, we exemplify how triple&#8197;E priorities can practically guide the development and implementation of processes from renewables conversions to complex customized products. We summarize by proposing a roadmap for the community aimed at raising awareness, fostering academia&#8211;industry collaboration, and stimulating further advances in sustainable chemical technologies across their broad scope.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation En Route to N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazones with internal alkynes is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N atropisomers were synthesized with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reactions triggered by the extrusion of small gaseous molecules have emerged as a powerful strategy for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds. However, their use in asymmetric synthesis remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by the denitrogenative transannulation of benzotriazones with alkynes. A broad range of N&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity control.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Secretoglobin 3A2 Covalent Homodimer and Photocaged Monomeric Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a small, secreted protein present only in mammals. Despite its unique self&#8208;assembly driven by disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization, current understanding of its physiology relies solely on in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures. SCGB3A2 chemical synthesis using KAHA ligation now enables access to monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues for studying its self&#8208;assembly behavior.







Abstract
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 belongs to an intriguing family of small, secreted proteins present only in mammals. Although members of the SCGB protein family have distinct amino acid sequences, they share structural similarities. Of particularly interest is the not yet fully understood self&#8208;assembly ability of SCGBs, which arise from covalent disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization. Recently, SCGB3A2 has attracted attention for its singular expression profile in airways. However, the knowledge on SCGB3A2 (patho)physiology derives exclusively from in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures, which hampers characterization of the mechanisms driving SCGB3A2 structural behavior. Herein, we document the chemical synthesis of SCGB3A2 in multi&#8208;milligram quantities. Key to access both monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues was the use of KAHA ligation and enabled masking of the cysteine residue. The synthetic proteins were used to investigate the SCGB3A2 self&#8208;assembly profile, confirming their high propensity to dimerization even in the absence of the key Cys residue.

         <title>DOTA&#8208;Based Plectin&#8208;1 Targeted Contrast Agent Enables Detection of Pancreatic Cancer in Human Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest survival rates which is related to the lack of diagnostic tools for early detection. In this study, we developed a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 that significantly improves imaging of PDAC in human tissue and in vivo. These results demonstrate the great potential of the probe to enable early PDAC diagnosis.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy with extremely poor patient survival rates. A key reason for the poor prognosis is the lack of effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at curable, premetastatic stages. Tumor surgical resection is PDAC's first&#8208;line treatment, however distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissue with current imaging tools remains a challenge. In this work, we report a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 for imaging PDAC with high specificity. To enable heterogeneous functionalization of the DOTA&#8208;core with multiple targeting peptide units and the fluorophore, a novel, fully clickable synthetic route that proceeds in one pot was developed. Extensive validation of the probe set the stage for PDAC detection in mice and human tissue. Altogether, these findings may pave the way for improved clinical understanding and early detection of PDAC progression as well as more accurate resection criteria.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;Stage Incorporation of N&#8208;Aryl Triazoles and Tetrazoles with Sulfonium Salts via C&#8722;H Activation</title>

The unprecedented ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage functionalization with easily accessible sulfonium salts enabled the C&#8722;H arylation of medicinally relevant N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles.







Abstract
The late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients is a key challenge in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles are important structural motifs with the potential to boost the activity of diverse drug molecules. Using easily accessible dibenzothiophenium salts for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, these scaffolds were introduced into a variety of bioactive compounds. Our methodology uses cost&#8208;efficient ruthenium, KOAc as a mild base and gives access to a plethora of highly decorated triazole and tetrazole containing drug derivatives.

Using easily accessible dibenzothiophenium salts for the ruthenium-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, these scaffolds were introduced into a variety of bioactive compounds. Our methodology uses cost-efficient ruthenium, KOAc as a mild base and gives access to a plethora of highly decorated triazole and tetrazole containing drug derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accessing Z&#8208;Enynes via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective propargylic dehydrogenation is described. Alkynes and allenes are transformed to 1,3&#8208;enynes with moderate Z&#8208;selectivity. Deprotonation is identified as rate&#8208;limiting, and the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect.







Abstract
Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. Z&#8208;alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of E&#8208;alkenes compared to Z&#8208;alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form Z&#8208;alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a Z&#8208;selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3&#8208;enynes through the invention of a Co&#8208;catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the Z&#8208;selectivity is included.

         <title>Photogeneration of Chlorine Radical from a Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorous 4CzIPN&#8226;Chloride Complex: Application in C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorous photoredox catalyst 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN (Rf8=C8F17) forms a supramolecular complex with chloride ions with high affinity. Integrating fluorous chains on the parent dye greatly enhances both the ion&#8208;binding affinity, as well as the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Efficient photooxidation of the chloride was observed, generating the chlorine HAT reagent, which was tested in the redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reaction.







Abstract
The chlorine radical is a strong HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) agent that is very useful for the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Albeit highly attractive, its generation from the poorly oxidizable chloride ion mediated by an excited photoredox catalyst is a difficult task. We now report that 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN, an electron&#8208;deficient fluorous derivative of the benchmark 4CzIPN photoredox catalyst belonging to the donor&#8208;acceptor carbazole&#8208;cyanoarene family, is not only a better photooxidant than 4CzIPN, but also becomes an excellent host for the chloride ion. Combining these two properties ultimately makes the self&#8208;assembled 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN&#8226;Cl&#8722; dual catalyst highly reactive in redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reactions promoted by the chlorine radical. Additionally, because of its fluorous character, the efficient separation/recovery of 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN could be envisioned.

         <title>The CF3 Group as a Synthon of the CF+ Unit in Palladium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

Pulling fluorine off: The unusually high activity of the C&#8722;F bond found in the homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; is correlated to the very low fluoride&#8208;ion affinity of the conjugate difluorocarbene complex [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722;, which is experimentally detected. Selective single, double or triple defluorination of a CF3 group is achieved under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; (1) is shown to be highly active towards amines. Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH2, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF3 ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CNR)]&#8722; (R=aryl). In this process the original CF3 group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of 1 with secondary amines R2NH proceeds with loss of just two F&#8208;substituents, whereby the Fischer&#8208;type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CFNR2)]&#8722; are formed (R=Et, Ph). The reaction of 1 with diamines affords different [(CF3)3Pd(NHC)]&#8722; complexes containing sterically non&#8208;demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene rings as well as the expanded&#8208;ring perimidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. This metal&#8208;tailored synthetic route, where a CF3 group acts as a pre&#8208;carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC&#8208;chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non&#8208;isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722; is experimentally detected.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Sensor Based on Steric Hindrance Regulated Molecular Packing for In Vivo Epilepsy Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescence sensing mechanism is presented by using steric hindrance quenchers to regulate the molecular packing state of fluorophores. The ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice brain is visualized by the SHINE sensor.







Abstract
Fluorescence sensing is crucial to studying biological processes and diagnosing diseases, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window with reduced background signals. However, it's still a great challenge to construct &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensors when the sensing wavelength extends into the NIR&#8208;II region to obtain higher imaging contrast, mainly due to the difficult synthesis of spectral overlapped quencher. Here, we present a new fluorescence quenching strategy, which utilizes steric hindrance quencher (SHQ) to tune the molecular packing state of fluorophores and suppress the emission signal. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that large SHQs can competitively pack with fluorophores and prevent their self&#8208;aggregation. Based on this quenching mechanism, a novel activatable &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensing method is achieved via bio&#8208;analyte responsive invalidation of SHQ, namely the Steric Hindrance Invalidation geNerated Emission (SHINE) strategy. As a proof of concept, the ClO&#8722;&#8208;sensitive SHQ lead to the bright NIR&#8208;II signal release in epileptic mouse hippocampus under the skull and high photon scattering brain tissue, providing the real&#8208;time visualization of ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice.

Here, we present a new fluorescence quenching strategy, which utilizes steric hindrance quencher (SHQ) to tune the molecular packing state of fluorophores and suppress the emission signal. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that large SHQs can competitively pack with fluorophores and prevent their self-aggregation. Based on this quenching mechanism, a novel activatable &#8220;off-on&#8221; sensing method is achieved via bio-analyte responsive invalidation of SHQ, namely the Steric Hindrance Invalidation geNerated Emission (SHINE) strategy. As a proof of concept, the ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive SHQ lead to the bright NIR-II signal release in epileptic mouse hippocampus under the skull and high photon scattering brain tissue, providing the real-time visualization of ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generation process in living epileptic mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Umbrella&#8208;Shaped Amphiphiles: Internal Alkylation of an Aromatic Micelle and Its Impact on Cavity Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internally multi&#8208;alkylated aromatic micelles are assembled in water from umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles featuring a linear alkyl chain flanked by two polyaromatic panels. The alkylation strongly enhances the stability of the novel micelles against dilution and heat. Notably, thanks to the softness of the fully alkyl&#8208;filled cavity, efficient uptake of large metallodyes and pseudorotaxane&#8208;like binding of cycloparaphenylenes is achieved.







Abstract
To develop new hybrid micelles with alkyl/polyaromatic core&#8211;shell structures, we synthesized umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles bearing a bent anthracene dimer with a linear alkyl chain (i.e., octyl and hexadecyl groups). The amphiphiles quantitatively assemble into spherical micelles (~2&#8211;3&#8197;nm in core diameter), possessing an alkylated cavity surrounded by a polyaromatic framework, in water. The alkylation significantly enhances the stability of the micellar structures against dilution (up to 9&#8197;&#956;M) and heat (up to &gt;120&#8201;&#176;C). The highly condensed hexadecyl core of the hybrid micelle, as indicated by solvatochromic guest probes, displays increased uptake ability toward large alkylated metallodyes. Interestingly, efficient uptake of aromatic macrocycles (i.e., [n]cycloparaphenylenes) by the present micelle provides pseudorotaxane&#8208;shaped host&#8211;guest composites with high emissivity (&#934;F=up to 35&#8201;%). Internal multi&#8208;alkylation of an aromatic micelle can thus successfully enhance its assembly stability/guest uptake functions.

         <title>Organometallic Chirality Sensing via &#8220;Click&#8221;&#8208;Like &#951;6&#8208;Arene Coordination with an Achiral Cp*Ru(II) Piano Stool Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with a readily available ruthenium piano stool complex and its use in an optical CD/UV relay assay allow time&#8208;efficient chromatography&#8208;free stereochemical analysis of a broad range of challenging molecules.







Abstract
Piano stool complexes have been studied over many years and found widespread applications in organic synthesis, catalysis, materials and drug development. We now report the first examples of quantitative chiroptical molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with readily available half sandwich complexes. This conceptually new approach to chirality sensing is based on irreversible acetonitrile displacement of [Cp*Ru(CH3CN)3]PF6 by an aromatic target molecule, a process that is fast and complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The metal coordination coincides with characteristic circular dichroism inductions that can be easily correlated to the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio of the bound molecule. A relay assay that decouples the determination of the enantiomeric composition and of the total sample amount by a practical CD/UV measurement protocol was developed and successfully tested. The introduction of piano stool complexes to the chiroptical sensing realm is mechanistically unique and extends the scope of currently known methods with small&#8208;molecule probes that require the presence of amino, alcohol, carboxylate or other privileged functional groups for binding of the target compound. A broad application range including pharmaceutically relevant multifunctional molecules and the use in chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis are also demonstrated.

         <title>Linkage Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic C2H4 Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are constructed by linkage engineering to efficiently catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalytic array structure composed of sp3 N sites in the aminal linkages promotes CO2 capture and enhances the reaction kinetics for C2H4 production, thus showing a much higher Faraday efficiency of C2H4 than imine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal&#8208;free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high&#8208;density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal&#8208;linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1&#8201;%, which is stand out in all reported metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine&#8208;linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.

         <title>Blocking Interfacial Proton Transport via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) for HER&#8208;free zinc anodes by anchoring ionic liquid (BMIM+) cations on Ti3C2Tx (MXene) substrate. The BMIM+ with a high coordination number of water molecules can significantly reduce the interfacial densities of H2O molecules. Therefore, the SAM can disrupt the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and hinder proton transport at the interface, suppressing HER.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, yet suffer from the issues of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and intricate side reactions on the Zn anode surface. The hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond networks play a critical role in interfacial proton transport that may closely relate to HER but are rarely investigated. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy which is constructed by anchoring ionic liquid cations on Ti3C2Tx substrate for HER&#8208;free Zn anode. Molecule dynamics simulations reveal that the rationally designed SAM with a high coordination number of water molecules (25&#8211;27, 4&#8211;6 for Zn2+) largely reduces the interfacial densities of H2O molecules, therefore breaking the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and blocking proton transport on the interface, by which the HER is suppressed. Then, a series of in situ characterizations demonstrate that negligible amounts of H2 gas are collected from the Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene anode. Consequently, the symmetric cell enables a long&#8208;cycling life of 3000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the stable Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene films are successfully used for coin full cells showing high&#8208;capacity retention of over 94&#8201;% after 1000 cycles and large&#8208;area (10&#215;5&#8197;cm2) pouch cells with desired performance.

Consequently, the symmetric cell enables a long-cycling life of 3000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. More significantly, the stable Zn@SAM-MXene films are successfully used for coin full cells showing high-capacity retention of over 94&#8201;% after 1000 cycles and large-area (10&#215;5&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) pouch cells with desired performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expedient Access to 18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes via Deaminative Radiofluorination of Aniline&#8208;Derived Pyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes find wide application as radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Here, we present a deaminative radiosynthetic approach via pyridinium tetrafluoroborates that facilitates radiofluorination of 33 structurally diverse heteroarenes in up to 98&#8201;% RCY (radiochemical yield). This method was also amenable to automation and was successfully translated to an automated synthesiser.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that pyridinium salts derived from abundant (hetero)anilines represent a novel precursor class for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions with [18F]fluoride. The value of this new 18F&#8208;fluorodeamination is demonstrated with the synthesis of over 30 structurally diverse and complex heteroaryl 18F&#8208;fluorides, several derived from scaffolds that were yet to be labelled with fluorine&#8208;18. The protocol tolerates heteroarenes and functionalities commonly found in drug discovery libraries, and is amenable to scale&#8208;up and automation on a commercial radiosynthesiser.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Selective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyridines and Isoquinolines through Dearomatized Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated pyridines are prepared via bench stable oxazino pyridine intermediates with unsymmetrical iodonium salts using Cu&#8208;catalysis. The strategy can be applied for meta&#8208;alkenylation upon simply switching to the corresponding alkenyl I(III) reagents and both C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalizations also work on isoquinolines.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization offers an efficient strategy for the synthesis of various elaborated N&#8208;containing heteroarenes. Along these lines, oxazino pyridines that can be readily prepared from pyridines, have been introduced as powerful substrates in radical&#8208; and ionic&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. However, the regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines remains a great challenge. Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines and isoquinolines through bench&#8208;stable dearomatized intermediates is reported. Electrophilic aryl&#8208;Cu(III) species, generated from readily accessible aryl I(III) reagents, enable the efficient meta&#8208;arylation of a broad range of pyridines and isoquinolines. The method also allows the meta&#8208;selective alkenylation of these heteroarenes using the corresponding alkenyl I(III)&#8208;reagents. Late&#8208;stage arylation of drug&#8208;derived pyridines and larger&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential of this synthetic methodology.

         <title>One&#8208;Component Cationic Lipids for Systemic mRNA Delivery to Splenic T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that predominantly target the liver and possess complex constituents, we designed simplified one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipid/mRNA nanoparticles (CLNs) for extrahepatic mRNA delivery. These CLNs facilitated mRNA expression in the spleen and T cells, demonstrating substantial potential for immunotherapy applications.







Abstract
Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non&#8208;liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine&#8208;based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications. This straightforward strategy extends the utility of lipid family for extrahepatic mRNA delivery, offering new insights into vector development beyond LNPs to further the field of precise mRNA therapy.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Boosted Hydronium Intercalation: A Paradigm Shift in Aluminum&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets are rich in oxygen defects, which tilt the adsorption effect of Al3+ and effectively inhibit further insertion/diffusion of Al3+. This phenomenon leaves space for H3O+ insertion, allowing it to insert into the lattice smoothly.







Abstract
In aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the insertion/extraction chemistry of Al3+ often leads to poor kinetics, whereas the rapid diffusion kinetics of hydronium ions (H3O+) may offer the solution. However, the presence of considerable Al3+ in the electrolyte hinders the insertion reaction of H3O+. Herein, we report how oxygen&#8208;deficient &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets unlock selective H3O+ insertion in a mild aluminum&#8208;ion electrolyte. The abundant oxygen defects impede the insertion of Al3+ due to excessively strong adsorption, while allowing H3O+ to be inserted/diffused through the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. This research advances our understanding of the mechanism behind selective H3O+ insertion in mild electrolytes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Inward Isomerization Hydroaminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization and hydraminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides has been developed. The combination isomerization&#8208;responsible catalyst and hydrocarbonylation&#8208;responsible catalyst was found to be a highly effective strategy to render the reaction feasible. The reaction shows highly functional group compatibility and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
In contrast to the kinetically favored outward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, the disfavored inward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes remains an important challenge. Herein, we have developed a novel and effective palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes and aniline hydrochlorides for the formation of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides in high yields and high site&#8208;selectivities. The high efficiency of the reaction is attributed to a relay catalysis strategy, in which the Markovnikov&#8208;favored [PdH]&#8208;PtBu3 catalyst is responsible for inward isomerization, while the [PdH]&#8208;Ruphos catalyst is responsible for hydroaminocarbonylation of the resulting conjugated aryl alkenes. The reaction exhibits highly functional group tolerance and provides a new method for formal carbonylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond.

&lt;p&gt;A novel palladium-catalyzed inward isomerization and hydraminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of &#945;-aryl carboxylic amides has been developed. The combination isomerization-responsible catalyst and hydrocarbonylation-responsible catalyst was found to be a highly effective strategy to render the reaction feasible. The reaction shows highly functional group compatibility and site-selectivity.

         <title>Enantiopure [6]&#8208;Azairidahelicene by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of a Configurationally Labile [4]&#8208;Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes, combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment, are readily accessible by an effective dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand. The two isolated enantiomers exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals.







Abstract
A pair of enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes incorporating chirality at the metal center and on the helicenic ligand were synthesized by dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand (4&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;benzo[g]phenanthrene, L1H) using bis&#8208;cyclometalated chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal only iridium(III) precursors as chiral inductors. The origin of the observed dkr is attributed to the different conformation and stability of diastereomeric reaction intermediates formed during the cyclometalation process. The isolated enantiomers exhibited circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), with |gphos| values of 1.8&#215;10&#8722;3.

         <title>Identification and characterization of thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyases with an unusual CDG motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical GDG(X)24&#8208;27N sequence, is highly conserved among ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We investigated a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE from Janthinobacterium sp. HH01) with an unusual cysteine (C458) replacing the first glycine of this motif. We found that JanthE has a high substrate promiscuity accepting long aliphatic &#945;&#8208;keto acids as donors. Sterically hindered aromatic aldehydes or non&#8208;activated ketones are acceptor substrates, giving access to a variety of secondary and tertiary alcohols as carboligation products. The crystal structure solved at a resolution of 1.9 &#197; reveals that C458 is not primarily involved in the cofactor binding as previously thought for the canonical glycine. Instead, it coordinates methionine 406, thus ensuring the integrity of the active site and the enzyme activity. We further determined the long&#8208;sought genuine tetrahedral intermediates formed with pyruvate and 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;butyrate in the pre&#8208;decarboxylation states and unravel atomic details for their stabilization in the active site. Collectively, we unravel an unexpected role for the first residue of the ThDP&#8208;binding motif and unlock a family of lyases able to perform valuable carboligation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Formal C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylations via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling with Versatile Arylsulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation via the dibenzothiophenylation/nickel&#8208;catalyzed eXEC sequence is presented. The first activation step selectively gives aryldibenzothiophenium salts, which are subsequently engaged in electroreductive nickel catalysis. The method provides various C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) linkages with high sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon contents. The demonstration of one&#8208;pot alkylations further reinforces the practicality of our approach.







Abstract
Producing sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon&#8208;enriched molecules is of particular interest due to their high success rate in clinical trials. The installation of aliphatic chains onto aromatic scaffolds was accomplished by nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with arylsulfonium salts. Thus, simple non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes could be alkylated through the formation of aryldibenzothiophenium salts. The reaction employs an electrochemical approach to avoid potentially hazardous chemical redox agents, and importantly, the one&#8208;pot alkylation proved also viable, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed 1,12&#8208;addition of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates to alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols furnished a wide range of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in high yields with good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of quinone methides formed in situ has been flourishing in recent years. In sharp contrast, the development and utilization of biphenyl quinone methides are rare. In this study, we achieved a remote stereocontrolled 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition of biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ for the first time. In the presence of a suitable chiral phosphoric acid, alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides were generated from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols, followed by enantioselective 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition with indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates. The strategy enabled the alcohols to serve as efficient allenylation reagents, providing practical access to a broad range of axially chiral allenes bearing a (1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;ol unit, which were previously less accessible. Combined with control experiments, density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism, indicating that enantioselectivity originates from the nucleophilic addition of alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides. Notably, not only the presence of biphenyl quinone methides as versatile intermediates was confirmed but also organocatalytic enantioselective 1,12&#8208;addition was established.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Ultrafast Construction of Zinc Tungstate Interface Layer for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zincophilic ZnWO4 layer has been ultrafast in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (ZWO@Zn) by a facile solution reaction. The ZWO@Zn can effectively eliminate the zinc dendrites and side reactions by regulating interfacial electric field distribution and promoting the uniform zinc deposition.







Abstract
Constructing artificial solid electrolyte interface on the Zn anode surface is recognized as an appealing method to inhibit zinc dendrites and side reactions, whereas the current techniques are complex and time&#8208;consuming. Here, a robust and zincophilic zinc tungstate (ZnWO4) layer has been in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (denoted as ZWO@Zn) by an ultrafast chemical solution reaction. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ZWO layer can effectively modulate the interfacial electric field distribution and promote the Zn2+ uniform diffusion, thus facilitating the uniform Zn2+ nucleation and suppressing zinc dendrites. Besides, ZWO layer can prevent direct contact between the Zn/water and increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential to eliminate side reactions. Consequently, the in situ constructed ZWO layer facilitates remarkable reversibility in the ZWO@Zn||Ti battery, achieving an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.36&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, unprecedented cycling lifespan exceeding 1800&#8197;h under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in ZWO@Zn||ZWO@Zn battery, and a steady and reliable operation of the overall ZWO@Zn||VS2 battery. The work provides a simple, low cost, and ultrafast pathway to crafting protective layers for driving advancements in aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Dependent Dual&#8208;Phosphorescent Cu4 Nanocluster with Remarkable Piezochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrostatic pressure, for the first time, was introduced into the atomically precise coinage metal copper(&#1030;) nanocluster [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) with intrinsic dual emission (DE) behavior to investigate the origin of DE phenomena. We observed interesting pressure&#8208;dependent optical variations and obvious piezochromism. High&#8208;pressure characterization and first&#8208;principles calculations revealed that the structural source of the DE behavior is the C=C stretching vibration on the benzene ring. The pressure effect will lead to the formation and strengthening of hydrogen bonds between clusters, thereby weakening the C=C vibration and causing the disappearance of Peak 1. This research provides a theoretical reference for designing novel DE materials in the future.







Abstract
The dual emission (DE) characteristics of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) are of significant theoretical and practical interest. Despite this, the underlying mechanism driving DE in Cu NCs remains elusive, primarily due to the complexities of excited state processes. Herein, a novel [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) NC, shielded by alkynyl and exhibiting DE, was synthesized. Hydrostatic pressure was applied to Cu4, for the first time, to investigate the mechanism of DE. With increasing pressure, the higher&#8208;energy emission peak of Cu4 gradually disappeared, leaving the lower&#8208;energy emission peak as the dominant emission. Additionally, the Cu4 crystal exhibited notable piezochromism transitioning from cyan to orange. Angle&#8208;dispersive synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction results revealed that the reduced inter&#8208;cluster distances under pressure brought the peripheral ligands closer, leading to the formation of new C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds in Cu4. It is proposed that these strengthened hydrogen bond interactions limit the ligands&#8242; vibration, resulting in the vanishing of the higher&#8208;energy peak. In situ high&#8208;pressure Raman and vibrationally resolved emission spectra demonstrated that the benzene ring C=C stretching vibration is the structural source of the DE in Cu4.

         <title>Giant ab&#8208;Plane Birefringence in Quasi&#8208;1D Fibrous Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Kramers&#8208;Kronig analysis was employed to determine the complex refractive index of fibrous red phosphorus, revealing a notable birefringence of 0.642@475&#8197;nm. This remarkable performance can be ascribed to the large electronic dipole polarizability inherent in phosphorus, alongside the anisotropic distribution of electron density and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pairs (SCALP) induced by the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional structure.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) van der Waals crystal fibrous red phosphorus (RP) exhibits pronounced in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy, positioning it as a potential candidate for polarization&#8208;related micro&#8208;nano devices. Unfortunately, a comprehensive investigation into the complex refractive index of fibrous RP and the structure&#8211;activity relationship connecting the distinctive quasi&#8208;1D structure with optical anisotropy is currently deficient. Herein, we have collectively determined the complex refractive index of the fibrous RP flakes within the ab&#8208;plane through Kramers&#8211;Kronig (KK) analysis and theoretical calculation. Notably, the maximum birefringence of fibrous RP reaches 0.642@475&#8197;nm with an absolute extinction coefficient of only 0.08, superior to the reported traditional optical crystals and the emerging low&#8208;dimensional materials as well. The remarkable birefringence can be attributed to the synergistic influence of the large electronic dipole polarizability, anisotropic electron density distribution and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP). This work demonstrates the potential of fibrous RP for polarization&#8208;sensitive devices, illuminating possibilities to exploit novel giant birefringent crystals based on the structure&#8211;activity relationship.

         <title>Synthetic Sialosides Terminated with 8&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted Sialic Acid as Selective Substrates for Sialidases from Bacteria and Influenza Viruses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing challenging C8&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;containing sialosides have been developed. High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies demonstrate that C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, bacteria, and influenza A and B viruses. The sialosides can be potentially used for diagnostic detection of sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.







Abstract
Sialosides containing C8&#8208;modified sialic acids are challenging synthetic targets but potentially useful probes for diagnostic substrate profiling of sialidases and elucidating the binding specificity of sialic acid&#8208;interacting proteins. Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing para&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;tagged &#945;2&#8211;3&#8208; and &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;linked sialyl galactosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido, C8&#8208;azido, or C8&#8208;amino derivatized N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies showed that the C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, various bacteria, and different influenza A and B viruses. Sialosides carrying Neu5Ac with a C8&#8208;azido modification were generally well tolerated by all the sialidases we tested, whereas sialosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were only cleaved by selective bacterial sialidases. In contrast, sialosides with C8&#8208;amino&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were cleaved by a combination of selective bacterial and influenza A virus sialidases. These results indicate that sialosides terminated with a C8&#8208;amino or C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid can be used with other sialosides for diagnostic profiling of disease&#8208;causing sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing challenging C8-modified sialic acid-containing sialosides have been developed. High-throughput substrate specificity studies demonstrate that C8-modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, bacteria, and influenza A and B viruses. The sialosides can be potentially used for diagnostic detection of sialidase-producing pathogens.

&lt;p&gt;Sialosides containing C8-modified sialic acids are challenging synthetic targets but potentially useful probes for diagnostic substrate profiling of sialidases and elucidating the binding specificity of sialic acid-interacting proteins. Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenol-tagged &#945;2&#8211;3- and &#945;2&#8211;6-linked sialyl galactosides containing C8-acetamido, C8-azido, or C8-amino derivatized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac).

         <title>Deep Red Light Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Heterojunction Polymer Dots for Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact heterojunction polymer dots act as a remarkable H2&#8208;production system in response to deep red light illumination. Hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) at the inflammatory tissues were selectively scavenged by H2, therefore accelerating the healing process of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
We describe small heterojunction polymer dots (Pdots) with deep&#8208;red light catalyzed H2 generation for diabetic skin wound healing. The Pdots with donor/acceptor heterojunctions showed remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to the donor or acceptor nanoparticles alone. We encapsulate the Pdots and ascorbic acid into liposomes to form Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors, which selectively scavenge &#8901;OH radicals in live cells and tissues under 650&#8197;nm light illumination. The antioxidant capacity of the heterojunction Pdots is ~10&#8197;times higher than that of the single&#8208;component Pdots described previously. Under a total light dose of 360&#8197;J/cm2, the Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors effectively scavenged &#8901;OH radicals and suppressed the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in skin tissues, thereby accelerating the healing of skin wounds in diabetic mice. This study provides a feasible solution for safe and effective treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

         <title>Tailoring Electric Double Layer by Cation Specific Adsorption for High&#8208;Voltage Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively&#8208;charged polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is constructed by the preferential adsorption of 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations on high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process.







Abstract
The interfacial instability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxides severely plagues practical application of high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a uniform and highly oxidation&#8208;resistant polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is engineered by in situ polymerizing 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations preferentially adsorbed on LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM83) surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the copolymerization of [VEIM][BF4] and vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC) endows P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer with the positively&#8208;charged imidazolium moieties, providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process. Consequently, the Li||NCM83 cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V exhibit excellent reversible capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C and considerable discharge capacity of 134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 without capacity decay after 100&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides deep understanding on tailoring electric double layer by cation specific adsorption for high&#8208;voltage quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Unlocking the NIR&#8208;II AIEgen for High Brightness through Intramolecular Electrostatic Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkylthio side chain on the thiophene bridge affords sulfur&#8212;nitrogen electrostatic lock, substantially improving the fluorescent brightness of the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained NIR&#8208;II AIEgen shows high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging and high sensitivity in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging and biosensing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for non&#8208;invasive, radiation&#8208;free, and rapid&#8208;response clinical diagnosis. However, it's still challenging to develop bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. In this study, we report a new strategy to enhance the brightness of NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking. By introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains of the thiophene bridge in TSEH molecule, the molecular motion of the conjugated backbone can be locked through intramolecular interactions between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This leads to enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescent emission of TSEH in both solution and aggregation states. Notably, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) of TSEH show enhanced brightness, which is 2.6&#8208;fold higher than TEH NPs with alkyl side chains. The in vivo experiments reveal the feasibility of TSEH NPs in vascular and tumor imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and precise resection for tiny tumors. In addition, polystyrene nanospheres encapsulated with TSEH are utilized for antigen detection in lateral flow assays, showing a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio 1.9&#8208;fold higher than the TEH counterpart in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens. This work highlights the potential for developing bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking and their potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.

         <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Solid&#8208;State Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;like capabilities of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are exhibited through a thermal response. They arise from the unique rigidity of composite building units (CBUs). The resulting flexible ZIF mechanics resemble the slider&#8208;crank mechanism, they are regulated by chemical functionality and give rise to anisotropic mechanical properties.







Abstract
Machines have continually developed with the needs of daily life and industrial applications. While the careful design of molecular&#8208;scale devices often displays enhanced properties along with mechanical movements, controlling mechanics within solid&#8208;state molecular structures remains a significant challenge. Here, we explore the distinct mechanical properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)&#8212;frameworks that contain hidden mechanical components. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we uncover the machine&#8208;like capabilities of ZIFs, wherein connected composite building units operate similarly to a mechanical linkage system. Importantly, this research suggests that certain ZIF subunits act as core mechanical components, paving an innovative view for the future design of solid&#8208;state molecular machines.

         <title>Size and Polarizability of Boron Cluster Carriers Modulate Chaotropic Membrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic closo&#8208;borates have been systematically studied to identify the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos through lipid bilayers and living cells. By modifying the size of the cluster core and the halogen substituent, we found that the polarizability, a factor that determines their chaotropicity, may serve as a predictor of their transport activity and cytotoxicity for the rational design of permeable drugs







Abstract
Perhalogenated closo&#8208;borates represent a new class of membrane carriers. They owe this activity to their chaotropicity, which enables the transport of hydrophilic molecules across model membranes and into living cells. The transport efficiency of this new class of cluster carriers depends on a careful balance between their affinity to membranes and cargo, which varies with chaotropicity. However, the structure&#8211;activity parameters that define chaotropic transport remain to be elucidated. Here, we have studied the modulation of chaotropic transport by decoupling the halogen composition from the boron core size. The binding affinity between perhalogenated decaborate and dodecaborate clusters carriers was quantified with different hydrophilic model cargos, namely a neutral and a cationic peptide, phalloidin and (KLAKLAK)2. The transport efficiency, membrane&#8208;lytic properties, and cellular toxicity, as obtained from different vesicle and cell assays, increased with the size and polarizability of the clusters. These results validate the chaotropic effect as the driving force behind the membrane transport propensity of boron clusters. This work advances our understanding of the structural features of boron cluster carriers and establishes the first set of rational design principles for chaotropic membrane transporters.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cyclotrimerization: A Versatile Tool to Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Stacking Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents, for the first time, the mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles. Utilizing Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and a ball mill, both small molecules and large organic frameworks could be obtained. Screening the reaction of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene by various parameters, such as reaction time, frequency, or temperature, significant impacts on the porosity of the polymer and its crystallinity were revealed.







Abstract
We introduce the first mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles, a facile strategy for synthesizing triazine&#8208;containing molecules and materials, overcoming challenges related to carbonization and solubility. Conducting this solid&#8208;state approach in a mixer ball mill with 4&#8208;Methylbenzonitrile, we synthesize Tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine quantitatively in as little as 90&#8197;minutes. Just as fast, this mechanochemical method facilitates the synthesis of the covalent triazine framework CTF&#8208;1 using 1,4&#8197;Dicyanobenzene. Material characterization confirms its porous (650&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and crystalline nature. Adjusting the induced mechanical energy allows control over the obtained stacking conformation of the resulting CTFs &#8208; from a staggered AB arrangement to an eclipsed AA stacking conformation. Finally, a substrate scope demonstrates the versatility of this approach, successfully yielding various CTFs.

         <title>Stabilizing Few&#8208;Atom Platinum Clusters by Zinc Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Glue for Efficient Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;step strategy for the efficient and accurate synthesis of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters by predeposition of Zn1 single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue on MgO supports (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO). The Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO catalyst exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% and a high activity with a TOF of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs.







Abstract
Few&#8208;atom metal clusters (FAMCs) exhibit superior performance in catalyzing complex molecular transformations due to their special spatial environments and electronic states, compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, achieving the efficient and accurate synthesis of FAMCs while avoiding the formation of other species, such as nanoparticles and SACs, still remains challenges. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy for synthesis of few&#8208;atom platinum (Pt) clusters by predeposition of zinc single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue (Zn1) on MgO nanosheets (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO), where FAMCs can be obtained over a wide range of Pt contents (0.09 to 1.45&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Zn atoms can act as Lewis acidic sites to allow electron transfer between Zn and Pt through bridging O atoms, which play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters. Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation. Moreover, an excellent activity with a turnover frequency of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs. Further theoretical studies revealed that the Pt atoms in Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO possess moderate steric hindrance, which enables high selectivity and activity for hydrosilylation. This work presents some guidelines for utilizing atomic&#8208;scale species to increase the synthesis efficiency and precision of FAMCs.

         <title>Development of Stable Water&#8208;Soluble Supratomic Silver Clusters Utilizing A Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Protected Strategy: Giant Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type Ag8@Nb162 Fluorescent Nanocluster</title>

         <dc:description>
A polyoxoniobate&#8208;protected approach has been introduced for the first time, aiming to synthesize stable and water&#8208;soluble silver nanoclusters. Employing this method, we have successfully synthesized a giant Ag8@Nb162 core&#8211;shell nanocluster exhibiting reversible temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence responses. Leveraging these fluorescence features, we have demonstrated a sophisticated multiple optical encryption mode with potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit technology.







Abstract
Atomically precise low&#8208;nuclearity (n&lt;10) silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have garnered significant interest due to their size&#8208;dependent optical properties and diverse applications. However, their synthesis has remained challenging, primarily due to their inherent instability. The present study introduces a new feasible approach for clustering silver ions utilizing highly negative and redox&#8208;inert polyoxoniobates (PONbs) as all&#8208;inorganic ligands. This strategy not only enables the creation of novel Ag&#8208;PONb composite nanoclusters but also facilitates the synthesis of stable low&#8208;nuclearity AgNCs. Using this method, we have successfully synthesized a small octanuclear rhombic [Ag8]6+ AgNC stabilized by six highly negative [LiNb27O75]14&#8722; polyoxoanions. This marks the first PONb&#8208;protected superatomic AgNC, designated as {Ag8@(LiNb27O75)6} (Ag8@Nb162), with an aesthetically spherical core&#8211;shell structure. The crystalline Ag8@Nb162 is stable under ambient conditions, What's more, it is water&#8208;soluble and able to maintain its molecular cluster structure intact in water. Further, the stable small [Ag8]6+ AgNC has interesting temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent reversible fluorescence response, based on which a multiple optical encryption mode for anti&#8208;counterfeit technology was demonstrated. This work offers a promising avenue for the synthesis of fascinating and stable PONb&#8208;protected AgNCs and sheds light on the development of new&#8208;type optical functional materials.

Further studies suggested that benefiting from boosted electron push&#8208;pull interactions, thereby facilitating charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Despite the pivotal role of molecular oxygen (O2) activation in artificial photosynthesis, the activation efficiency is often restricted by sluggish exciton dissociation and charge transfer kinetics within polymer photocatalysts. Herein, we propose two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)&#8208;based imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF and TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF, to promote O2 activation. Because of enhanced electron push&#8208;pull interactions that facilitated charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited superior photocatalytic activity in electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions over TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF under visible light irradiation, including the photosynthesis of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;thiocyano&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds and H2O2. These findings highlight the significant potential of the rational design of COFs with D&#8211;A configurations as suitable candidates for advanced photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Nonflammable Phosphate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Safe and Stable Potassium Batteries Enabled by Optimized Solvation Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The safety and lifespan of energy storage devices have always been a challenge for the development of batteries, and potassium&#8208;ion batteries are no exception. In this work, we present an advanced non&#8208;flammable electrolyte achieved by carefully manipulating the solvation capability of a family of phosphate solvents. The customized electrolyte enables safe and stable cycling of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Current potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are limited in safety and lifetime owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. To address these issues, herein, we report an innovative non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design strategy that leverages an optimal moderate solvation phosphate&#8208;based solvent which strikes a balance between solvation capability and salt dissociation ability, leading to superior electrochemical performance. The formulated electrolyte simultaneously exhibits the advantages of low salt concentration (only 0.6&#8197;M), low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high oxidative stability, and safety. Our electrolyte also promotes the formation of self&#8208;limiting inorganic&#8208;rich interphases at the anode surface, alongside robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase on iron&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues, mitigating electrode/electrolyte side reactions and preventing Fe dissolution. Notably, the PIBs employing our electrolyte exhibit exceptional durability, with 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 2,000&#8197;cycles at high&#8208;voltage of 4.2&#8197;V in a coin cell. Impressively, in a larger scale pouch cell, it maintains over 81&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1,400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C&#8208;rate with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. This work represents a significant advancement toward the realization of safe, sustainable, and high&#8208;performance PIBs.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch at the Heterojunction of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch is crucial for the efficiency and lifetime of perovskite solar cells because it affects interfacial charge behavior and perovskite degradation. This review discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, carrier dynamics, and detailed characterizations. It also exposes challenges to mitigate mismatch as well as a solution and outlook to promote renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;technology advancements.







Abstract
Lattice mismatch significantly influences microscopic transport in semiconducting devices, affecting interfacial charge behavior and device efficacy. This atomic&#8208;level disordering, often overlooked in previous research, is crucial for device efficiency and lifetime. Recent studies have highlighted emerging challenges related to lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells, especially at heterojunctions, revealing issues like severe tensile stress, increased ion migration, and reduced carrier mobility. This review systematically discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, and carrier dynamics. It also includes detailed characterizations of these phenomena and summarizes current strategies including epitaxial growth and buffer layer, as well as explores future solutions to mitigate mismatch&#8208;induced issues. We also provide the challenges and prospects for lattice mismatch, aiming to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, and contribute to renewable energy technology advancements.

         <title>Achieving a Deeply Desodiated Stabilized Cathode Material by the High Entropy Strategy for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy strategy is applied to design a new P2 phase cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, aiming to improve stability in deeply desodiated states. This material exhibits superior reversibility with 0.61 Na extracted, attributed to triggered lattice&#8208;oxygen redox reaction activity and facilitated Na+ migration. As a result, it demonstrates excellent initial Coulombic efficiency, high energy density, and lengthened cycling performance.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based layered oxides are currently of significant interest as cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low toxicity and high specific capacity. However, the practical applications are impeded by sluggish intrinsic Na+ migration and poor structure stability as a result of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and complicated phase transition. In this study, a high&#8208;entropy strategy is proposed to enhance the high&#8208;voltage capacity and cycling stability. The designed P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.6Cu0.08Ni0.09Fe0.18Ti0.05O2 achieves a deeply desodiation and delivers charging capacity of 158.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 corresponding to 0.61 Na with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.2&#8201;%. The charge compensation is attributed to the cationic and anionic redox reactions conjunctively. Moreover, the crystal structure is effectively stabilized, leading to a slight variation of lattice parameters. This research carries implications for the expedited development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Aggregation Enhanced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence through Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented a novel approach focused on modifying the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process by influencing dynamic processes in excited states through the aggregation effect. The results demonstrated that restricting molecular rotation and vibration is beneficial for enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST).







Abstract
Integrating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters holds great promise for the advancement of highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Despite recent advancements, a thorough comprehension of the underlying mechanisms remains imperative for the practical application of such materials. In this work, we introduce a novel approach aimed at modulating the TADF process by manipulating dynamic processes in excited states through aggregation effect. Our findings reveal that aggregation not only enhances both prompt and delayed fluorescence simultaneously but also imposes constraints on molecular reorientation. This constraint reinforces spin&#8208;orbit coupling and reduces the energy gap between singlets and triplets. These insights deepen our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the aggregation effect on TADF materials and provide valuable guidance for the design of high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescent materials.

Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer reactions have a century&#8208;old history in organic chemistry and are a primary method for the synthesis of cyclopropanes. Much of the work in this field has focused on the use of diazo compounds and related precursors, which can transfer a carbene fragment to a catalyst with concomitant loss of a stable byproduct. Despite the utility of this approach, there are persistent limitations in the scope of viable carbenes, most notably those lacking stabilizing substituents. By coupling carbene transfer chemistry with two&#8208;electron redox cycles, it is possible to expand the available starting materials that can be used as carbene precursors. In this Minireview, we discuss emerging catalytic reductive cyclopropanation reactions using either gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes or carbonyl compounds. This strategy is inspired by classic stoichiometric transformations, such as the Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and the Clemmensen reduction, but instead entails the formation of a catalytically generated transition metal carbene or carbenoid. We also present recent efforts to generate carbenes directly from methylene (CR2H2) groups via a formal 1,1&#8208;dehydrogenation. These reactions are currently restricted to substrates containing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which serve to facilitate deprotonation and subsequent oxidation of the anion.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfones via Ligand&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled nickel catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclic sulfolene has been developed. A range of structrally diverse and enantioenriched C2 or C3 substituted cyclic sulfones are conveniently synthesized by this method. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Cyclic sulfones have demonstrated important applications in drug discovery. However, the catalytic and enantioselective synthesis of chiral cyclic sulfones remains challenging. Herein, we develop nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of sulfolenes to streamline the synthesis of chiral alkyl cyclic sulfones. The method has broad scope and high functional group tolerance. The regioselectivity can be controlled by ligands only. A neutral PYROX ligand favors C3&#8208;alkylation whereas an anionic BOX ligand favors C2&#8208;alkylation. This control is kinetic in origin as the C2&#8208;bound Ni intermediates are always thermodynamically more stable. Reactivity study of a wide range of relevant Ni intermediates reveal a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle with a NiII&#8722;H species as the resting state. The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining step is the insertion of this NiII&#8722;H species into 2&#8208;sulfolene. This work provides an efficient catalytic method for the synthesis of an important class of organic compounds and enhances the mechanistic understanding of Ni&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective hydroalkylation.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Approach to the Enantioselective Construction of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Alcohols by Radical Epoxide Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate an operationally simple approach towards &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in good to excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios in two steps from diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins. Our method relies on an unprecedented, radical, intramolecular syn&#8208;allyl transfer to intermediate &#946;&#8208;titanoxy radicals resulting from an Cp2TiIIIallyl&#8208;induced fragmentation of epoxide precursors.







Abstract
We describe a highly stereoconvergent radical epoxide allylation towards diastereomerically and enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in two steps from olefins. Our approach combines the stereospecifity and enantioselectivity of the Shi epoxidation with the unprecedented Ti(III)&#8208;promoted intramolecular radical group transfer allylation of epoxides. A directional isomerization step via configurationally labile radical intermediates enables the selective preparation of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in a unique fashion.

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Amination Reactions Mediated by Visible Light and a Chiral Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron porphyrin that is linked via an ethynyl unit to a chiral octahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoisoindol&#8208;1&#8208;one scaffold serves as a potent catalyst for the enantioselective, visible light&#8208;mediated intermolecular amination of 3&#8208;arylmethyl&#8208;substituted quinolones and pyridones. A two&#8208;point hydrogen bonding interaction is responsible for the exquisite site&#8208; and enantioselectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a chiral iron porphyrin catalyst, various 3&#8208;arylmethyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones and 2&#8208;pyridones underwent an enantioselective amination reaction (20&#8197;examples; 93&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The substrates were used as the limiting reagents, and fluorinated aryl azides (1.5&#8197;equivalents) served as nitrene precursors. The reaction is triggered by visible light which allows a facile dediazotation at ambient temperature. The selectivity of the reaction is governed by a two&#8208;point hydrogen bond interaction between the ligand of the iron catalyst and the substrate. Hydrogen bonding directs the amination to a specific hydrogen atom within the substrate that is displaced by the nitrogen substituent either in a concerted fashion or by a rebound mechanism.

         <title>Electrochemically Mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Driven by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces alternating current (AC) electrolysis in ATRP using a symmetrical Cu/Cu electrode pair to generate the CuI activator complex and drive the polymerization. Square and sinusoidal waves at 0.1&#8197;Hz from an AC generator were used to polymerize many monomers (including functionals) in organic solvent, water, and bulk. The same electrode pair and the same AC current value were used for all polymerizations and block copolymerizations.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) and pulsed electrolysis are gaining traction in electro(organic) synthesis due to their advantageous characteristics. We employed AC electrolysis in electrochemically mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (eATRP) to facilitate the regeneration of the activator CuI complex on Cu0 electrodes. Additionally, Cu0 served as a slow supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA ATRP), enabling the activation of alkyl halides and the regeneration of the CuI activator through a comproportionation reaction. We harnessed the distinct properties of Cu0 dual regeneration, both chemical and electrochemical, by employing sinusoidal, triangular, and square&#8208;wave AC electrolysis alongside some of the most active ATRP catalysts available. Compared to linear waveform (DC electrolysis) or SARA ATRP (without electrolysis), pulsed and AC electrolysis facilitated slightly faster and more controlled polymerizations of acrylates. The same AC electrolysis conditions could successfully polymerize eleven different monomers across different mediums, from water to bulk. Moreover, it proved effective across a spectrum of catalyst activity, from low&#8208;activity Cu/2,2&#8208;bipyridine to highly active Cu complexes with substituted tripodal amine ligands. Chain extension experiments confirmed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of the produced polymers, yielding functional and high molecular&#8208;weight block copolymers. SEM analysis indicated the robustness of the Cu0 electrodes, sustaining at least 15 consecutive polymerizations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of molecular heterostructures increases the molecular dipole moment and extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Moreover, the interchain covalent bond (C=C) at its junction provides a channel for rapid electron transfer, leading to improved H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation without sacrificial agent.







Abstract
As an alternative to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by complex anthraquinone oxidation process, photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen without sacrificial agents is highly demanded. Herein, a covalently connected molecular heterostructure is synthesized via sequential C&#8722;H arylation and Knoevenagel polymerization reactions for visible&#8208;light and sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 synthesis. The subsequent copolymerization of the electron&#8208;deficient benzodithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione (BTD) and the electron&#8208;rich biphenyl (B) and p&#8208;phenylenediacetonitrile (CN) not only expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated domain but also increases the molecular dipole moment, which largely promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers. The optimal heterostructured BTDB&#8208;CN0.2 manifested an impressive photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 1920&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 2.2 and 11.6&#8197;times that of BTDB and BTDCN. As revealed by the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) and theoretical calculations, the linkage serves as a channel for the rapid transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. Further, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) uncovers that the oxygen reduction reaction occurs through the step one&#8208;electron pathway and the mutual conversion between C=O and C&#8722;OH with the anchoring of H+ during the catalysis favored the formation of H2O2. This work provides a novel perspective for the design of efficient organic photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The construction of molecular heterostructures increases the molecular dipole moment and extends the &#960;-conjugated system. Moreover, the interchain covalent bond (C=C) at its junction provides a channel for rapid electron transfer, leading to improved H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production under visible-light irradiation without sacrificial agent.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Phenethylamine Synthesis: N&#8208;Pyridinium Aziridines as Latent Dual Electrophiles</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines serve as latent dual electrophiles for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines. Ni&#8208;catalyzed aziridine ring opening with organozinc nucleophiles affords a diverse family of &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts which upon reductive N&#8722;N cleavage provides access to rapid and modular molecular assembly of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Phenethylamines are widely represented in biologically and pharmacologically active organic small molecules. Here, we introduce N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines as latent dual electrophiles for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines. Bromide&#8208;promoted ring opening generates &#946;&#8208;halopyridinium amines. Selective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling between organozinc nucleophiles and the benzylic C&#8722;Br electrophile affords a diverse family of &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts, and coupling is stereoconvergent in the presence of chiral ligands. Subsequent Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive N&#8722;N bond activation within the &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts furnishes the products of formal olefin carboamination. Other reductive N&#8722;N cleavage reactions are demonstrated to provide access to free primary amines, alkylated amines, heterocycles, and products derived from N&#8208;centered radical chemistry. The developed reaction sequence can be implemented in the context of complex molecules and natural product derivatives. Together, the described results provide a general and modular synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines and significantly expand the utility of N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines as linchpins in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Metal Ions Trigger the Gelation of Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptide&#8208;Appended Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three FeII4L4 metal&#8208;organic cages were fabricated via a L&#8722;D&#8722;L&#8208;tripeptide ligand with different sequences. The cages could form gels triggered by coordinating thiol groups of peripheral peptides around metal vertices to the second metal ion. This strategy might allow for the modular and conventional design of other recyclable and functional cage&#8208;gel materials.







Abstract
We report a series of coordination cages that incorporate peptide chains at their vertices, prepared through subcomponent self&#8208;assembly. Three distinct heterochiral tripeptide subcomponents were incorporated, each exhibiting an L&#8722;D&#8722;L stereoconfiguration. Through this approach, we prepared and characterized three tetrahedral metal&#8208;peptide cages that incorporate thiol and methylthio groups. The gelation of these cages was probed through the binding of additional metal ions, with the metal&#8208;peptide cages acting as junctions, owing to the presence of sulfur atoms on the peripheral peptides. Gels were obtained with cages bearing cysteine at the C&#8208;terminus. Our strategy for developing functional metal&#8208;coordinated supramolecular gels with a modular design may result in the development of materials useful for chemical separations or drug delivery.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyses Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from Taxus x media cell cultures, is functionally characterized to efficiently catalyze oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate&#8208;feeding and isotope labelling experiments together with density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from Taxus&#215;media cell cultures, has been functionally characterized to efficiently catalyse the formation of the oxetane ring in tetracyclic taxoids. Transient expression of TmCYP1 in Nicotiana benthamiana using 2&#945;,5&#945;,7&#946;,9&#945;,10&#946;,13&#945;&#8208;hexaacetoxytaxa&#8208;4(20),11(12)&#8208;diene (1) as a substrate led to the production of a major oxetane derivative, 1&#946;&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1&#8201;a), and a minor 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide derivative, baccatin I (1&#8201;b). However, feeding the substrate decinnamoyltaxinine J (2), a 5&#8208;deacetylated derivative of 1, yielded only 5&#945;&#8208;deacetylbaccatin I (2&#8201;b), a 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate&#8208;feeding, 2H and 18O isotope labelling experiments, and density functional theory calculations. This reaction could be an intramolecular oxidation&#8208;acetoxyl rearrangement and the construction of the oxetane ring may occur through a concerted process; however, the 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide might be a shunt product. In this process, the C5&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group in substrate is crucial for the oxetane ring formation but not for the 4(20)&#8208;epoxy ring formation by TmCYP1. These findings provide a better understanding of the enzymatic formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
Table of Contents: The integration of BINOL derivatives into the supramolecular architectures of chiral macrocycles and cages offers distinct advantages in applications such as circularly polarized luminescence, enantiomer separation, biological transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Chirality, a fundamental principle in chemistry, biology, and medicine, is prevalent in nature and in organisms. Chiral molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are crucial in biomolecular synthesis, as well as in the development of functional materials. Among these, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL) stands out for its stable chiral configuration, versatile functionality, and commercial availability. BINOL is widely employed in asymmetric catalysis and chiral materials. This review mainly focuses on recent research over the past five years concerning the use of BINOL derivatives for constructing chiral macrocycles and cages. Their contributions to chiral luminescence, enantiomeric separation, transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis were examined.

&lt;p&gt;Table of Contents: The integration of BINOL derivatives into the supramolecular architectures of chiral macrocycles and cages offers distinct advantages in applications such as circularly polarized luminescence, enantiomer separation, biological transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality, a fundamental principle in chemistry, biology, and medicine, is prevalent in nature and in organisms. Chiral molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are crucial in biomolecular synthesis, as well as in the development of functional materials. Among these, 1,1&#8242;-binaphthyl-2,2&#8242;-diol (BINOL) stands out for its stable chiral configuration, versatile functionality, and commercial availability. BINOL is widely employed in asymmetric catalysis and chiral materials. This review mainly focuses on recent research over the past five years concerning the use of BINOL derivatives for constructing chiral macrocycles and cages. Their contributions to chiral luminescence, enantiomeric separation, transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis were examined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes electrochemiluminescence (ECL) from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in ECL microscopy, emphasizing original configurations which enable the mapping of the (electro)chemical reactivity and the imaging of biological entities. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging single ECL photons or molecules.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is rapidly evolving from an analytical method into an optical microscopy. The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes it from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques, owing to its near&#8208;zero background, remarkable sensitivity, and absence of photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in ECL imaging technology, emphasizing original configurations which enable the imaging of biological entities and the improvement of the analytical properties by increasing the complexity and multiplexing of bioassays. Additionally, mapping the (electro)chemical reactivity in space provides valuable information on nanomaterials and facilitates deciphering ECL mechanisms for improving their performances in diagnostics and (electro)catalysis. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging at the ultimate limits of single molecules, single photons or single chemical reactions, and the current challenges to translate the ECL imaging advances to other fields such as material science, catalysis and biology.

         <title>Phase Engineering of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeCuNiAlTi high entropy alloy with uniform intermetallic nanoparticles shows enhanced electrochemical performance of nitrate reduction to ammonia in terms of NH3 yield (0.52&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE (95.23&#8201;%) due to increased electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer efficiency. Density functional theory calculations confirm the multi&#8208;site including Fe, Co and Ni catalysis with the lowest energy barrier on Co sites for nitrate reduction.







Abstract
Directly electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an efficient and environmentally friendly technology for ammonia (NH3) production but is challenged by highly selective electrocatalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique properties are attractive materials in catalysis, particularly for multi&#8208;step reactions. Herein, we first reported the application of HEA (FeCoNiAlTi) for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 (NRA). The bulk HEA is active for NRA but limited by the unsatisfied NH3 yield of 0.36&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.66&#8201;%. Through an effective phase engineering strategy, uniform intermetallic nanoparticles are introduced on the bulk HEA to increase electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer efficiency. The resulting nanostructured HEA (n&#8208;HEA) delivers enhanced electrochemical NRA performance in terms of NH3 yield (0.52&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE (95.23&#8201;%). Further experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the multi&#8208;active sites (Fe, Co, and Ni) dominated electrocatalysis for NRA over the n&#8208;HEA. Notably, the typical Co sites exhibit the lowest energy barrier for NRA with *NH2 to *NH3as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen&#8208;Depleted and Unitary Ti3C2T x  Surface Terminals by Molten Salt Electrochemical Etching Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene materials, with metal&#8208;like conductivities and versatile terminals, have been considered to be promising surface modification materials for Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, the oxygen&#8208;rich and hybridized terminations caused by conventional methods limit their advantages in inhibiting zinc dendrite growth and reducing corrosion&#8208;related side reactions. Herein, &#8722;O&#8208;depleted, &#8722;Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx was precisely fabricated by the molten salt electrochemical etching of Ti3AlC2, and controlled in&#8208;situ terminal replacement from &#8722;Cl to unitary &#8722;S or &#8722;Se was achieved. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;O&#8208;depleted and unitary&#8208;terminal Ti3C2Tx as Zn anode coatings provided excellent hydrophobicity and enriched zinc&#8208;ionophilic sites, facilitating Zn2+ horizontal transport for homogeneous deposition and effectively suppressing water&#8208;induced side reactions. The as&#8208;assembled Ti3C2Sx@Zn symmetric cell achieved a cycle life of up to 4200 h at a current density and areal capacity of 2 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively, with an impressive cumulative capacity of up to 7.25 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 // 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. These findings provide an effective electrochemical strategy for tailoring &#8722;O&#8208;depleted and unitary Ti3C2Tx surface terminals and advancing the understanding of the role of specific Ti3C2Tx surface chemistry in regulating the plating/stripping behaviors of metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Optimization of Azacryptands for Targeting Three&#8208;Way DNA Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transient melting of the duplex&#8208;DNA (B&#8208;DNA) during DNA transactions allows repeated sequences to fold into non&#8208;B DNA structures, including DNA junctions and G&#8208;quadruplexes. These noncanonical structures can act as impediments to DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, thereby triggering DNA damage and ultimately jeopardizing genomic stability. Their stabilization by ad hoc ligands is currently being explored as a putative anticancer strategy since it might represent an efficient way to inflict toxic DNA damage specifically to rapidly dividing cancer cells. The relevance of this strategy is only emerging for three&#8208;way DNA junctions (TWJs) and, to date, no molecule has been recognized as a reference TWJ ligand, featuring both high affinity and selectivity. Herein, we characterize such reference ligands through a combination of in vitro techniques comprising affinity and selectivity assays (competitive FRET&#8208;melting and TWJ Screen assays), functional tests (qPCR and Taq stop assays), and structural analyses (molecular dynamics and NMR investigations). We identify novel azacryptands TrisNP&#8208;amphi and TrisNP&#8208;ana as the most promising ligands, interacting with TWJs with high affinity and selectivity. These ligands represent new molecular tools to investigate the cellular roles of TWJs and explore how they can be exploited in innovative anticancer therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Nanotechnology Targeting Mitochondria: From Subcellular Molecular Imaging to Tailor&#8208;Made Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria, one of the most important organelles, represent a crucial subcellular target for fundamental research and biomedical applications. Despite significant advances in the design of DNA nanotechnologies for a variety of bio&#8208;applications, the dearth of strategies that enable mitochondria targeting for subcellular molecular imaging and therapy remains an outstanding challenge in this field. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progresses on the emerging design and application of DNA nanotechnology for mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular imaging and tumor treatment. We first highlight the engineering of mitochondria&#8208;localized DNA nanosensors for in situ detection and imaging of diverse key molecules that are essential to maintain mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial DNA and microRNA, enzymes, small molecules, and metal ions. Then, we compile the developments of DNA nanotechnologies for mitochondria&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;tumor therapy, including modularly designed DNA nanodevices for subcellular delivery of therapeutic agents, and programmed DNA assembly for mitochondrial interference. We will place an emphasis on clarification of the chemical principles of how DNA nanobiotechnology can be designed to target mitochondria for various biomedical applications. Finally, the remaining challenges and future directions in this emerging field will be discussed, hoping to inspire further development of advanced DNA toolkits for both academic and clinical research regarding mitochondria.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Mechanochemical Glass Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glasses, known for their potential in gas separation, optics, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, benefit from the processability of their (supercooled) liquid state. Traditionally, MOF glasses are produced by heating MOF crystals to their melting point and then cooling the liquid MOF to room temperature under an inert atmosphere. While effective, this melt&#8208;quenching technique requires high energy due to the high temperatures involved. It also limits the scope of new material development by restricting the compositional range to only those combinations of metal ions and linkers that are highly thermally stable. An alternative, mechanical milling at room temperature, has demonstrated its capability to transform MOF crystals into amorphous phases. However, the specific conditions under which these amorphous phases exhibit glass&#8208;like behavior remain uncharted. In this study, we explore the mechanochemical amorphization and vitrification of a variety of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with diverse linkers and different metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+&#160;and Cu2+) at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate that ZIFs capable of melting can be successfully converted into glasses through ball&#8208;milling. Remarkably, some non&#8208;meltable ZIFs can also be vitrified using the ball&#8208;milling technique, as highlighted by the preparation of the first Cu2+&#8208;based ZIF glass.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Phenothiazine&#8208;based Pd2L4&#8208;type Coordination Cage and Its Isolable Crystalline Polyradical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyradical cages are of great interest because they show very fascinating physical and chemical properties, but many challenges remain, especially for their synthesis and characterization. Herein, we present the synthesis of a polyradical cation cage 14&#8226;+ through post&#8208;synthetic oxidation of a redox&#8208;active phenothiazine&#8208;based Pd2L4&#8208;type coordination cage 1. It's worth noting that 1 exhibits excellent&#160;reversible electrochemical and chemical redox activity due to the introduction of a bulky 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl substituent. The generation of 14&#8226;+ through reversible electrochemical oxidation is investigated by in situ UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Meanwhile, chemical oxidation of 1 can also produce 14&#8226;+ which can be reversibly reduced back to the original cage 1, and the process is monitored by EPR and NMR spectroscopies. Eventually, we succeed in the isolation and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 14&#8226;+, whose electronic structure and conformation are distinct to original 1. The magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the predominantly antiferromagnetic interactions between the four phenothiazine radical cations in 14&#8226;+. We believe that our study including the facile synthesis methodology and in situ spectroelectrochemistry will shed some light on the synthesis and characterization of novel polyradical systems, opening more perspectives for developing functional supramolecular cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Bilateral Chemical Linking at NiOx Buried Interface Enables Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted NiOx&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit considerable potential because of their low&#8208;temperature processing and outstanding excellent stability, while is challenged by the carriers transfer at buried interface owing to the inherent low carrier mobility and abundant surface defects that directly deteriorates the overall device fill factor. Present work demonstrates a chemical linker with the capability of simultaneously grasping NiOx&#160;and perovskite crystals by forming a Ni&#8208;S&#8208;Pb bridge at buried interface to significantly boost the carriers transfer, based on a rationally selected molecule of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;thione (NCS). The constructed buried interface not only reduces the pinholes and needle&#8208;like residual PbI2&#160;at the buried interface, but also deepens the work function and valence band maximum positions of NiOx, resulting in a smaller VBM offset between NiOx&#160;and perovskite film. Consequently, the modulated PSCs achieved a high fill factor up to 86.24%, which is as far as we know the highest value in records of NiOx&#8208;based inverted PSCs. The NCS custom&#8208;tailored PSCs and minimodules (active area of 18 cm2) exhibited a champion efficiency of 25.05% and 21.16%, respectively. The unencapsulated devices remains over 90% of their initial efficiency at maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1700 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneously Strengthening and Toughening All&#8208;Natural Structural Materials via 3D Nanofiber Network Interfacial Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing structural materials from sustainable raw materials is considered an efficient way to reduce the potential threat posed by plastics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding combining excellent mechanical and thermal properties, especially the balance of strength and toughness. Here, we report a 3D nanofiber network interfacial design strategy to strengthen and toughen all&#8208;natural structural materials simultaneously. The introduced protonated chitosan at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose forms the interfacial interlocking structure of nanonetworks, achieving a robust physical connection and providing enough physical contact sites for chemical crosslinking. The obtained sustainable structural material successfully integrates excellent mechanical and thermal properties on the nanoscale of cellulose nanofibers, such as light weight, high strength, and superior thermal expansion coefficient. The relationship between structural design and comprehensive mechanical property improvement is analyzed in detail, providing a universal perspective to design sustainable high&#8208;performance structural materials from nanoscale building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchored Weakly&#8208;Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes endowed with high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, fast Li&#8208;ion desolvation process and decent ionic conductivity over wide temperature region are known critical for low temperature and fast&#8208;charging performance of energy&#8208;dense batteries, yet these characteristics are rarely satisfied simultaneously. Here, we report anchored weakly&#8208;solvated electrolytes (AWSEs), that are designed by extending the chain length of polyoxymethylene ether electrolyte solvent, can achieve the above merits at moderate salt concentrations. The &#8208;O&#8208;CH2&#8208;O&#8208; segment in solvent enables the weak four&#8208;membered ring Li+ coordination structure and the increased number of segments can anchor the solvent by Li+ without largely sacrificing the ionic dissociation ability. Therefore, the single salt/single solvent AWSEs enable solvent co&#8208;intercalation&#8208;free behavior towards graphite (Gr) anode and high oxidation stability towards high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;NCM811), as well as the formation of inorganic rich electrode/electrolyte interphase on both of them due to the anion&#8208;rich solvation shells. The capacity retention of Gr||NCM811 Ah&#8208;class pouch cell can reach 70.85% for 1000 cycles at room&#8208;temperature and 75.86% for 400 cycles at &#8208;20 &#176;C. This work points out a promising path toward the molecular design of electrolyte solvents for high&#8208;energy/power battery systems that are adaptive for extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequentially Regulating Potential&#8208;Determining Step for Lowering CO2 Electroreduction Overpotential over Te&#8208;Doped Bi Nanotips</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into formate is recognized an economically&#8208;viable route to upgrade CO2, but requires high overpotential to realize the high selectivity owing to high energy barrier for driving the involved proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and serious ignorance of the second PCET. Herein, we surmount the challenge through sequential regulation of the potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) over Te&#8208;doped Bi (TeBi) nanotips. Computational studies unravel the incorporation of Te heteroatoms alters the PDS from the first PCET to the second one by substantially lowering the formation barrier for *OCHO intermediate, and the high&#8208;curvature nanotips induce enhanced electric field that can steer the formation of asymmetric *HCOOH. In this scenario, the thermodynamic barrier for *OCHO and *HCOOH can be sequentially decreased, thus enabling a high formate selectivity at low overpotential. Experimentally, distinct TeBi nanostructures are obtained via controlling Te content in the precursor and TeBi nanotips achieve &gt;90% of Faradaic efficiency for formate production over a comparatively positive potential window (&#8208;0.57 V to &#8208;1.08 V). The strong Bi&#8208;Te covalent bonds also afford a robust stability. In an optimized membrane electrode assembly device, the formate production rate at 3.2 V reaches 10.1 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, demonstrating great potential for practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8208;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic module for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8208;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8208;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100 mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5 mM) in &gt;90% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6 g&#183;L &#8208;1&#160;&#183;h &#8208;1&#160;,&#160;which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over previously reported values.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Capture and Low Energy Release of NH3 by Azophenol Decorated Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In NH3 capture technologies, the desorption process is usually driven by high temperature and low pressure (such as 150&#8208;200&#176;C under vacuum), which accounts for intensive energy consumption and CO2 emission. Developing light responsive adsorbent is promising in this regard but remains a great challenge. Here, we for the first time designed and synthesized a light responsive azophenol&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF), COF&#8208;HNU38, to address this challenge. We found that at 25 &#176;C and 1.0 bar the cis &#8208;COF exhibited a NH3 uptake capacity of 7.7 mmol g&#8208;1 and a NH3/N2 selectivity of 158. In the adsorbed NH3, about 29.0% could be removed by vis&#8208;light irradiated cis&#8208;trans isomerization at 25 &#176;C, and the remaining NH3 might be released at 25 &#176;C under vacuum. Almost no decrease in adsorption capacity was observed after eight adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. As such, an efficient NH3 capture and low energy release strategy was established thanks to the multiple hydrogen bond interactions (which are strong in total but weak in individuals) between NH3 and the smart COF, and the increase in polarity and in number of hydrogen bond sites after the trans&#8208;cis isomerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Group Transposition via Iridium&#8208;Nitrenoid Leading to Amidative Inner&#8208;Sphere Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a fundamental mechanistic investigation into photochemical metal&#8208;nitrenoid generation and inner&#8208;sphere transposition reactivity using organometallic photoprecursors. By designing Cp*Ir(hydroxamate)(Ar) complexes, we induced photo&#8208;initiated ligand activation, allowing us to explore the amidative &#963;(Ir&#8211;aryl) migration reactivity. A combination of experimental mechanistic studies, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations revealed that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer enables the &#963;(N&#8211;O) cleavage, followed by Ir&#8208;acylnitrenoid generation. The final inner&#8208;sphere &#963;(Ir&#8211;aryl) group migration results in a net amidative group transposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Solid&#8208;Additive Strategy for Achieving Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells with Over 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition of active layers in organic solar cells (OSCs) offers immense potential for optimizing performance through precise tailoring of each layer. However, achieving high&#8208;performance LbL OSCs with distinct solid additives in each layer remains challenging. In this study, we explore a novel approach that strategically incorporates different solid additives into specific layers of LbL devices. To this end, we introduce FeCl3 into the lower donor (D18) layer as a p&#8208;type dopant to enhance hole concentration and mobility. Concurrently, we incorporate the wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer poly(9,9&#8208;di&#8208;n&#8208;octylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl) (PFO) into the upper acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) layer to improve the morphology and prolong exciton lifetime. Unlike previous studies, our approach combines these two strategies to achieve higher and more balanced electron and hole mobility without affecting device open&#8208;circuit voltage, while also suppressing charge recombination. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO device increases to 18.12%, while the D18/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device attains a PCE of 18.79%. These values represent substantial improvements over the control device's PCE of 17.59%. Notably, when both FeCl3 and PFO are incorporated, the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.17%. In summary, our research results demonstrate the effectiveness of the layered solid additive strategy in improving OSC performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the diverse electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces (EEIs) is a critical challenge to developing more efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. Establishing a predictive molecular&#8208;level understanding of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) is challenging due to the presence of multiple intertwined chemical and electrochemical processes occurring at battery electrodes. Similarly, chemical conversions in reactive electrochemical systems are often influenced by the heterogeneous distribution of active sites, surface defects, and catalyst particle sizes. In this mini review, we highlight an emerging field of interfacial science that isolates the impact of specific chemical species by preparing precisely&#8208;defined EEIs and visualizing the reactivity of their individual components using single&#8208;entity characterization techniques. We highlight the broad applicability and versatility of these methods, along with current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art instrumentation and future opportunities for these approaches to address key scientific challenges related to batteries, chemical separations, and fuel cells. We establish that controlled preparation of well&#8208;defined electrodes combined with single entity characterization will be crucial to filling key knowledge gaps and advancing the theories used to describe and predict chemical and physical processes occurring at EEIs and accelerating new materials discovery for energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Overall Kinetics by Se&#8208;Br Chemistry in Rechargeable Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries severely impedes the application in extreme conditions. Bridging the electrodes, the electrolyte plays a crucial role in regulating kinetic behaviors of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we report a multifunctional electrolyte additive of phenyl selenium bromide (PhSeBr) to simultaneously exert positive influences on both electrodes and the electrolyte. For the cathode, an ideal conversion routine with lower energy barrier can be attained by the redox mediator and homogenous catalyst derived from PhSeBr, thus improving the reaction kinetics and utilization of sulfur. Meanwhile, the presence of Se&#8208;Br bond helps to reconstruct a loose solvation sheath of lithium ions and a robust bilayer SEI with excellent ionic conductivity. The Li&#8208;S battery with PhSeBr displays superior long cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 1164.7 mAh g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C rate. And the pouch cell exhibits a maximum capacity of 845.3 mAh and a capacity retention of 94.8 % after 50 cycles. Excellent electrochemical properties are also obtained in extreme conditions of high sulfur loadings and low temperature of &#8208;20 &#176;C. This work demonstrates the versatility and practicability of the special additive, striking out an efficient but simple method to design advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3,5&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Functionalized Benzene Molecular Cage: An Environmentally Responsive Scaffold that Supports Hierarchical Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New stimulus responsive scaffolds are of interest as constituents of hierarchical supramolecular ensembles. 1,3,5&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Functionalized, facially segregated benzene moieties have a time&#8208;honored role as building blocks for host molecules. However, their user as switchable motifs in the construction of multi&#8208;component supramolecular structures remains poorly explored. Here, we report a molecular cage 1, which consists of a bent anthracene dimer 3 paired with 1,3,5&#8208;tris(aminomethyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene 2. As the result of the pH&#8208;induced ababab &#8596; bababa isomerization of the constituent functionalized benzene units derived from 2, this cage can reversibly convert between an open state and a closed form, both in solution and in the solid state. Cage 1 was used to create stimuli&#8208;responsive hierarchical superstructures, viz. Russian doll&#8208;like complexes with [K&#8834;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8834;1]+ and [K&#8834;cryptand&#8208;222&#8834;1]+. The reversible assembly and disassembly of these superstructures could be induced by switching cage 1 from its open to closed form. The present study thus provides an unusual example where pH&#8208;triggered conformation motion within a cage&#8208;like scaffold is used to control the formation and disassociation of hierarchical ensembles.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Dienyl End&#8208;Capping of Ruthenium Catalyzed Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Allyl Compounds through Base&#8208;Promoted Metallacyclobutane Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate an effective and facile end&#8208;capping technique for ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) using readily available allyl compounds as a new type of terminating agents. This new type of end&#8208;capping reactions, which are based on the basepromoted decomposition of ruthenocyclobutane intermediates, introduce diene moiety onto the chain end of ROMP polymers while simultaneously deactivating the ruthenium complex. These termination reactions are highly efficient, typically completing within 1 minute at 0 oC with &gt;95% end&#8208;capping fidelity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strong Supramolecular Mechanophore with Controlled Mechanical Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular mechanophores typically exhibit much lower mechanical strengths than covalent counterparts, with strengths usually around 100 pN, which is significantly lower than the nN&#8208;scale strength of covalent bonds. Inspired by the slow dissociation kinetics of the cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline (HIQ) complex, we discovered that charge&#8208;dipole repulsion can be utilized to create strong supramolecular mechanophores. When activated at its &#8208;COO&#8208; state, the CB[7]&#8208;HIQ complex exhibits a high mechanical strength of ~700 pN, comparable to weak covalent bonds such as Au&#8208;S bonds or a thiol&#8208;maleimide adducts. The strength of the CB[7]&#8208;HIQ complex can also be tuned with pH in a gradual manner, with a minimum value of ~150 pN at its &#8208;COOH state, similar to an ordinary supramolecular conjugate. This research may pave the way for the development of supramolecular architectures that combine the advantages of covalent and supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Heat&#8208;Resistant Carbon&#8208;Coated Potassium Magnesium Hexacyanoferrate Nanoplates for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of their low cost and high energy density. However, the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;remove [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and crystal water lead to structural instability and capacity deterioration as well as the stereotype of poor thermostability of conventional HCFs. Herein, we report (100) face&#8208;oriented potassium magnesium hexacyanoferrate (KMgHCF) nanoplates with low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and high crystallinity, enabling thermostability up to 550 &#176;C, high&#8208;temperature carbon coating and crystal water elimination. The as&#8208;obtained KMgHCF/C nanoplates exhibit superior potassium storage properties, including a large reversible capacity of 84.6 mAh g&#8722;1, a high voltage plateau of 3.87 V, excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance over 15000 cycles and high rate capability at 5 A g&#8722;1. The unprecedented cycling stability of KMgHCF/C is attributed to the synergistic effect of a highly reversible two&#8208;phase reaction, low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and no crystal water, a specially exposed steady (100) surface, and a protective carbon coating. This work provides a new material selection and modification strategy for the practical application of HCFs in PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Structure Facilitates High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Utilization Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zinc&#8208;iodine aqueous battery is a promising energy storage device, but the conventional two&#8208;electron reaction potential and energy density of the iodine cathode are far from meeting practical application requirements. Given that iodine is rich in redox reactions, activating the high&#8208;valence iodine cathode reaction has become a promising research direction for developing high&#8208;voltage zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this work, by designing a multifunctional electrolyte additive trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH), a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer I&#8208;/I2/I+ reactions with a high theoretical specific capacity is achieved through a unique amine group, Cl bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. Characterization techniques such as synchrotron radiation, in&#8208;situ Raman spectra, and DFT calculations are used to verify the mechanism of the stable bidentate structure. This electrolyte additive stabilizes the zinc anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling the zinc anode to cycle steadily at a maximum areal capacity of 57 mAh cm&#8208;2 with 97% zinc utilization rate. Finally, the four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5. The unique bidentate coordination structure contributes to the further development of high&#8208;valence and high capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>BF2&#8208;Bridged Azafulvene Dimer&#8208;Based 1064 nm Laser&#8208;Driven Superior Photothermal Agent for Deep&#8208;Seated Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic photothermal reagents (PTAs) with absorption bands located in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) window are highly desirable for effectively combating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, the rarely reported NIR&#8208;II absorbing PTAs still suffer from a low molar extinction coefficient (MEC, &#949;), inadequate chemostability and photostability, as well as the high light power density required during the therapeutic process. Herein, we developed a series of boron difluoride bridged azafulvene dimer acceptor&#8208;integrated small organic PTAs. The B&#8208;N coordination bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated azafulvene dimer backbone endow it the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, facilitating the vigorous donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) structure PTAs with NIR&#8208;II absorption. Notably, the PTAs namely OTTBF shows high MEC (7.21&#215; 104 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1), ultrahigh chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. After encapsulated into water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticles, OTTBF NPs can achieve remarkable photothermal conversion effect under 1064 nm irradiation with a light density as low as 0.7 W cm&#8208;2, which is the lowest reported NIR&#8208;II light power used in PTT process as we know. Furthermore, OTTBF NPs have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo deep&#8208;seated cancer treatments under 1064 nm laser. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D&#8208;A&#8208;D structured NIR&#8208;II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>para&#8208;Aminoazobenzenes &#8211; Bipolar Redox&#8208;Active Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzenes (ABs) are versatile compounds featured in numerous applications for energy storage systems, such as solar thermal storages or phase change materials. Additionally, the reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of these diazenes to the nitrogen&#8208;based anion radical has been used in battery applications. Although the oxidation of ABs is normally irreversible, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diamino substitution allows a reversible 2e&#8211; oxidation, which is attributed to the formation of a stable bis&#8208;quinoidal structure. Herein, we present a system that shows a bipolar redox behaviour. In this way, ABs can serve not only as anolytes, but also as catholytes. The resulting redox potentials can be tailored by suitable amine&#8208; and ring&#8208;substitution. For the first time, the solid&#8208;state structure of the oxidized form could be characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonreducing Sugar Scaffold Enables the Development of Immunomodulatory TLR4&#8208;specific LPS Mimetics with Picomolar Potency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Innate immune defense mechanisms against infection and cancer encompass the modulation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)&#8208;mediated inflammation, including upregulation of various transcription factors and the activation of pro&#8208;inflammatory pathways important for immune surveillance. Dysfunction of PRRs&#8208;mediated signaling has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases, while the overactivation of PRRs&#8208;driven responses during infection can lead to devastating consequences such as acute lung injury or sepsis. We used crystal structure&#8208;based design to develop immunomodulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mimetics targeting one of the ubiquitous PRRs, toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4). Taking advantage of an exo&#8208;anomeric conformation and specific molecular shape of synthetic nonreducing &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diglucosamine, which was investigated by NMR, we developed two sets of Lipid A mimicking glycolipids capable of either potently activating innate immune responses or inhibiting pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling. Stereoselective 1,1'&#8208;glycosylation towards fully orthogonally protected nonreducing GlcN&#946;(1&#8596;1')&#946;GlcN followed by stepwise assembly of differently functionalised phosphorylated glycolipids provided biologically active molecules that were evaluated for their ability to trigger or to inhibit cellular innate immune responses. Two LPS mimetics, identified as potent TLR4&#8208;specific inducers of the intracellular signaling pathways, serve as vaccine adjuvant&#8208; and immunotherapy candidates, while anionic glycolipids with TLR4&#8208;inhibitory potential hold therapeutic promise for the management of acute or chronic inflammation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating reconstruction&#8208;engineered active sites for accelerated electrocatalytic conversion of urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reconstruction&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts with enriched high active Ni species for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) have recently become promising candidates for energy conversion. However, to inhibit the over&#8208;oxidation of urea brought by the high valence state of Ni, tremendous efforts are devoted to obtaining low&#8208;value products of nitrogen gas to avoid toxic nitrite formation, undesirably causing inefficient utilization of the nitrogen cycle. Herein, we proposed a mediation engineering strategy to significantly boost high&#8208;value nitrite formation to help close a loop for the employment of a nitrogen economy. Specifically, platinum&#8208;loaded nickel phosphides (Pt&#8208;Ni2P) catalysts exhibit a promising nitrite production rate (0.82 mol kWh&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2), high stability over 66 h of Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery operation, and 135 h of co&#8208;production of nitrite and hydrogen under 200 mA cm&#8208;2 in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system. The in situ spectroscopic characterizations and computational calculations demonstrated that the urea oxidation kinetics is facilitated by enriched dynamic Ni3+ active sites, thus augmenting the &#8220;cyanate&#8221; UOR pathway. The *NOO desorption was further verified as the rate&#8208;determining step for nitrite generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Birds with One Stone: Multifunctional TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs Network as Sulfur/Lithium Host for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inevitable shuttling and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) as well as the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites have strongly limited the practical applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). To address these issues, we have innovatively constructed the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulated Co nanoparticles in situ grown on TiN&#8208;MXene nanosheets, denoted as TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs, which could serve simultaneously as both sulfur/Li host to kill &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; to (1) efficiently capture soluble LiPSs and expedite their redox conversion, (2) accelerate nucleation/decomposition of solid Li2S, and (3) induce homogeneous Li deposition. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs/S cathode with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm&#8722;2 could show a high reversible specific capacity of 1129.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, and ultralong cycle life over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. More importantly, it even achieves a high areal capacity of 6.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 50 cycles under a sulfur loading as high as 8.9 mg cm&#8722;2 and a low E/S ratio of 5.0 &#181;L mg&#8722;1. Besides, TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs as Li host could deliver a stable Li plating/striping behavior over 1000 h.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>M&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrode materials for many electro&#8208;reduction reactions. However, their stability is far from practical applications, and their deactivation mechanism has been rarely investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the structural degradation of M&#8211;N&#8211;C (M=Co, Ni, and Fe) at industrial&#8208;grade current density for long&#8208;term electro&#8208;reduction. Both M&#8211;N and N&#8211;C bonds are broken, resulting in the gradual hydrogenation and dissolution of N in the form of ammonia. The residual M is finally converted to M&#8208;containing core&#8208;shell nanoparticles after sequential dissolution, redeposition, and electro&#8208;reduction. The destruction of the M&#8211;N&#8211;C structure and the formation of nanoparticles greatly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Our work highlights the structural degradation and deactivation mechanism of M&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8208;type SACs under strong reductive conditions and provides useful information for inspiring researchers to develop new strategies to improve the electrocatalytic stability of similar types of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrodeuteroalkylation of Unactivated Olefins Using Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isotopically labeled alkanes play a crucial role in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. While some deuterated methylating agents are readily available, the limited accessibility of other deuteroalkyl reagents has hindered the synthesis of corresponding products. In this study, we introduce a nickel&#8208;catalyzed system that facilitates the synthesis of various deuterium&#8208;labeled alkanes through the hydrodeuteroalkylation of d2&#8208;labeled alkyl TT salts with unactivated alkenes. Diverging from traditional deuterated alkyl reagents, alkyl thianthrenium (TT) salts can effectively and selectively introduce deuterium at &#945; position of alkyl chains using D2O as the deuterium source via a single&#8208;step pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE). Our method allows for high deuterium incorporation, and offers precise control over the site of deuterium insertion within an alkyl chain. This technique proves to be invaluable for the synthesis of various deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds, especially those of pharmaceutical relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Confined Growth of Highly Ordered Metal Atomic Arrays for Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal atom catalysts have been among the most important research objects due to their specific physical and chemical properties. However, precise control of the anchoring of metal atoms is still challenging to achieve. Cobalt and iridium atomic arrays formed sequentially ordered stable arrays in graphdiyne (GDY) triangular cavities depending on their intrinsic chemical properties and interactions. The success of this method was attributed to multifunctional integration of GDY, enabling selective growth from one to several atoms and various atomic densities. The bimetallic atom arrays show several advantages resulting from reducibility of acetylene bonds, space limiting effect, incomplete charge transfer between GDY and metal atoms, and sp&#8208;C hybridized triple bond skeleton. This well&#8208;designed system exhibits unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a mass activity of 2.6 A mgcat.&#8211;1 at a low overpotential of 300 mV, which is 216.6 times higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IrO2 catalyst, and long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Understanding Hydroxide Diffusion Mechanism in Anion Exchange Membranes during Electrochemical Processes with RDAnalyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the understanding of hydroxide transport mechanisms in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is beneficial for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs in the renewable energy system. However, the high complexity and lack of adequate analytic tools make it challenging to clarify different mechanisms unambiguously. Herein, we developed an in&#8208;house toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to conduct an effective analysis of hydroxide diffusion mechanisms from ReaxFF molecular dynamic simulations. Using the experimentally well&#8208;synthesized T20NC6NC5N as a model system, we successfully decoupled the hydroxide diffusion mechanisms into free Vehicular and free Grotthuss, as well as associated Vehicular and associated Grotthuss, which was not yet achieved previously. Meanwhile, RDAnalyzer managed to specifically identify the drift length of hydroxide species for each mechanism under the electric field, which worked as an ideal variable for calculating the conductivity of AEMs. Our theoretically predicted conductivity for T20NC6NC5N agrees reasonably with experimental results, indicating the reliability of RDAnalyzer. This work not only provides a rational understanding of the complex hydroxide diffusion mechanisms in AEMs but also holds the potential to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs with computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Dual Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Chiral Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored through&#8208;space conjugated chiral foldamers exhibiting switchable dual circularly polarized luminescence with opposite signs at different emission wavelengths are successfully realized, which are attributed to the two transformable secondary structures of opposite chirality.







Abstract
Organic materials with switchable dual circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are highly desired because they can not only directly radiate tunable circularly polarized light themselves but also induce CPL for guests by providing a chiral environment in self&#8208;assembled structures or serving as the hosts for energy transfer systems. However, most organic molecules only exhibit single CPL and it remains challenging to develop organic molecules with dual CPL. Herein, novel through&#8208;space conjugated chiral foldamers are constructed by attaching two biphenyl arms to the 9,10&#8208;positions of phenanthrene, and switchable dual CPL with opposite signs at different emission wavelengths are successfully realized in the foldamers containing high&#8208;polarizability substitutes (cyano, methylthiol and methylsulfonyl). The combined experimental and computational results demonstrate that the intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation has significant contributions to stabilizing the folded conformations. Upon photoexcitation in high&#8208;polar solvents, strong interactions between the biphenyl arms substituted with cyano, methylthio or methylsulfonyl and the polar environment induce conformation transformation for the foldamers, resulting in two transformable secondary structures of opposite chirality, accounting for the dual CPL with opposite signs. These findings highlight the important influence of the secondary structures on the chiroptical property of the foldamers and pave a new avenue towards efficient and tunable dual CPL materials.

         <title>Type&#8197;I Photoinitiator Based on Sustainable Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable carbon dots (CDs) comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as Type&#8197;I photoinitiators (PI) for traditional free radical photopolymerization. The polymer networks obtained exhibit less inhomogeneity compared to traditional phosphine oxide photoinitiators. The remarkably lower migration rate of the CD based PIs gives hope to solve toxicological issues arising with some traditional PIs.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as photoinitiators for traditional free radical photopolymerization. Carbon dots were made following a solvothermal procedure from sustainable furfural available from lignocellulose. Surficial aldehyde moieties reacted with hydroxylamine to the respective oxime while reaction with benzoyl chloride resulted in a biobased Type&#8197;I photoinitiator comprising sustainable carbon dot (CD&#8208;PI). Photoinitiating ability was compared with the traditional photoinitiator (PI) ethyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl benzoyl) phenyl phosphinate (TPO&#8208;L) by real&#8208;time FTIR with UV exposure at 365&#8197;nm. Photopolymer composition based on a mixture of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) resulted in a similar final conversion of about 70&#8201;% using either CD&#8208;PI or TPO&#8208;L. Nevertheless, it appeared homogeneous in the case of compositions processed with CD&#8208;PI, while those made with TPO&#8208;L were heterogeneous as shown by two glass transition temperatures. Moreover, the migration rate of CD&#8208;PI in the cured samples was lower in comparison with those samples using TPO&#8208;L as PI.

         <title>Stereoselective Entry into &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Oxepane Scaffolds through a Chalcogen Bonding Catalyzed Strain&#8208;Release C&#8208;Septanosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting chalcogen bonding catalysis, a rare thermodynamically favored strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation approach was developed to access the biologically relevant &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane scaffold. Besides tolerating a broad selection of substrates, this strategy taps upon an unknown steric guided intramolecular aglycone transposition pathway via a pentavalent silicon intermediate to achieve the excellent stereoselectivity outcome.







Abstract
The utility of unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) such as chalcogen bonding has lately emerged as a robust platform to access synthetically difficult glycosides stereoselectively. Herein, we disclose the versatility of a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst to facilitate access into the challenging, but biologically interesting 7&#8208;membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane core through an &#945;&#8208;selective strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation. Methodically, this strategy represents a switch from more common but entropically less desired macrocyclizations to a thermodynamically favored ring&#8208;expansion approach. In light of the general lack of stereoselective methods to access C&#8208;septanosides, a remarkable palette of silyl&#8208;based nucleophiles can be reliably employed in our method. This include a broad variety of useful synthons, such as easily available silyl&#8208;allyl, silyl&#8208;enol ether, silyl&#8208;ketene acetal, vinylogous silyl&#8208;ketene acetal, silyl&#8208;alkyne and silylazide reagents. Mechanistic investigations suggest that a mechanistic shift towards an intramolecular aglycone transposition involving a pentacoordinate silicon intermediate is likely responsible in steering the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Sucrose&#8208;Powered Liposome Nanosensors for Urinary Glucometer&#8208;Based Monitoring of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer presents a tremendous opportunity to enhance prognostic outcomes, and there is an increasing desire for sensitive and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection tools. We present a liposome nanosensor for sensitive urinalysis&#8208;based cancer monitoring by using sucrose to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into a glucose meter&#8208;compatible readout.

Abstract
Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer holds immense potential in enhancing prognostic outcomes. There is an increasing desire for versatile tools to enable simple, sensitive, and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection. By exploiting the extraintestinal metabolic inertness and efficiency renal clearance of sucrose, we designed a liposome nanosensor using sucrose as a messenger to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into glucose meter readout, enabling economical and sensitive urinalysis for cancer detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT). Our results demonstrate that the nanosensors exhibited significant signal differences between tumor&#8208;bearing and healthy mice in both orthotopic and metastatic tumor models. Additionally, efficient elimination of the nanosensors through the hepatobiliary pathway was observed with no significant toxicity. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic modality significantly assists in personalized pharmacological treatment and follow&#8208;up efficacy assessment. We envision that this modular liposome nanosensor platform might be applied for economically detecting diverse diseases via a simple urinary test.

         <title>Modifying Proton Relay into Bioinspired Dye&#8208;based Coordination Polymer for Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) imparts an energetic advantage over solo electron transfer in activating inert substances. Natural PCET enzyme catalysis generally requires tripartite preorganization of proton relay, substrate&#8208;bound active center, and redox mediator, making the processes efficient and precluding side reactions. Inspired by this, a heterogeneous photocatalytic PCET system was established to achieve higher PCET driving forces by modifying proton relays into anthraquinone&#8208;based anionic coordination polymers. The proximally separated proton relays and photoredox&#8208;mediating anthraquinone moiety allowed pre&#8208;assembly of inert substrate between them, merging proton and electron into unsaturated bond by photoreductive PCET, which enhanced reaction kinetics than the counter catalyst without proton relay. This photocatalytic PCET method was applied to a broad&#8208;scoped reduction of aryl ketones, unsaturated carbonyls, and aromatic compounds. The distinctive regioselectivities for the reduction of isoquinoline derivatives were found to occur on the carbon&#8208;ring sides. PCET&#8208;hydrogenated radical intermediate of quinoline could be trapped by alkene for proton relay&#8208;assisted Minisci addition, forming the pharmaceutical aza&#8208;acenaphthene scaffold within one step. When using heteroatom(X)&#8211;H/C&#8211;H compounds as proton&#8208;electron donors, this protocol could activate these inert bonds through photooxidative PCET to afford radicals and trap them by electron&#8208;deficient unsaturated compounds, furnishing the direct X&#8211;H/C&#8211;H functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual S = 1 Four&#8208;Coordinate Fe(IV) Complexes Supported by Bisamide Ligands: Syntheses, Characterization, and Electronic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic relevance of Fe(IV) species in non&#8208;heme iron catalysis has motivated synthetic advances in well&#8208;defined five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate Fe(IV) complexes for a better understanding of their fundamental electronic structures and reactivities. Herein, we report the syntheses of FeDipp2 and FeMes2, a pair of unusual four&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme formally Fe(IV) complexes with S = 1 ground states supported by strongly donating bisamide ligands. By combining spectroscopic characterization and computational modeling, we found that small variations in ligand aryl substituents resulted in substantial changes in both structures and bonding. This work highlights the strong donor capabilities and modularity of the bisamide ligand set. More broadly, it is a critical contribution to the utilization of ligand design to modulate molecular geometries and electronic structures of low&#8208;coordinate, high&#8208;valent iron complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Interpretable Data&#8208;Driven Descriptors for Establishing the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Through an artificial&#8208;intelligence (AI) data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d&#8208;band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3&#8208;5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF&#8208;based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Hydride in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries as a&#160;Pulverization Accelerator of Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a highly promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;specific capacity anode, the industrial&#8208;scale utilization of micron silicon has been hindered by the issue of pulverization during cycling. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of regulating the inorganic components of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in improving pulverization, the evolution of most key inorganic components in the SEI and their correlation with silicon failure mechanisms remain ambiguous. This study provides a clear and direct correlation between the lithium hydride (LiH) in the SEI and the degree of micron silicon pulverization in the battery system. The reverse lithiation behavior of LiH on micron silicon during de&#8208;lithiation exacerbates the localized stress in silicon particles and contributes to particle pulverization. This work successfully proposes a novel approach to decouple the SEI from electrochemical performance, which can be significant to decipher the evolution of critical SEI components at varied battery anode interfaces and analyze their corresponding failure mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Functional Groups Regulate Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Molecular Electrocatalyst for Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor represents a promising approach to industrial&#8208;level H2O2 production, while it is hampered by the lack of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts in acidic medium. Herein, we present a strategy for the specific oxygen functional group (OFG) regulation to promote the H2O2 selectivity up to 92% in acid on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular assembled with reduced graphene oxide. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray adsorption spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy combined with theoretical calculation unravel that different OFGs exert distinctive regulation effects on the electronic structure of Co center through either remote (carboxyl and epoxy) or vicinal (hydroxyl) interaction manners, thus leading to the opposite influences on the promotion in 2e&#8208; ORR selectivity. As a consequence, the PEM electrolyzer integrated with the optimized catalyst can continuously and stably produce the high&#8208;concentration of ca. 7 wt% pure H2O2 aqueous solution at 400 mA cm&#8208;2 over 200 h with a cell voltage as low as ca. 2.1 V, suggesting the&#160;application potential in industrial&#8208;scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Polymer Electrolyte Blocking Lattice Oxygen Evolution from High&#8208;Voltage Nickel&#8208;rich Cathodes for Ultra&#8208;Thermal Stabile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li&#8208;ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2&#8208; species in Ni&#8208;rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel&#8208;like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA&#8208;Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C&#8208;F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self&#8208;assemble on Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+&#8594;Co4+) at high volt (&gt;4.2V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA&#8208;F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97 Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200 times at 4.7V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120&#8451; without short circuits or explosions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ni-rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li-ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2- species in Ni-rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel-like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA-Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C-F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self-assemble on Ni-rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+&#8594;Co4+) at high volt (&amp;gt;4.2V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA-F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97 Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200 times at 4.7V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120&#8451; without short circuits or explosions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collective and Diverted Total Synthesis of the Strasseriolides: A Family of Macrolides Endowed with Potent Antiplasmodial and AntitrypanosomalActivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strasseriolide macrolides show promising in vitro and in vivo activities against P. falciparum and T. cruzi, the parasites causing malaria and Chagas disease, respectively. However, the as yet poor understanding of structure/activity relationships and the fact that one family member proved systemically toxic for unknown reasons render a more detailed assessment of these potential lead compounds difficult. To help overcome these issues, a collective total synthesis was devised. The key steps consisted of a ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) reaction to forge a common macrocyclic intermediate followed by a hydroxy&#8208;directed ruthenium catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation of the propargyl alcohol site thus formed. The resulting alkenyltin derivative served as the central node of the synthesis blueprint, which could be elaborated into the natural products themselves as well as into a set of non&#8208;natural analogues according to the concept of diverted total synthesis. The recorded biological data confirmed the potency of the compounds and showed the lack of noticeable cytotoxicity. The &#8220;northern&#8221; allylic alcohol subunit was recognized as an integral part of the pharmacophore, yet it provides opportunities for chemical modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Relay Coupling of Perfluoroalkyl and Vinylogous Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Chiral carboxylic acids and their derivatives are highly valuable structural motifs in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, the introduction of a sterically demanding sidechain to the &#946;&#8208;carbon, such as an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, remains a significant challenge in classical polar processes. Recently, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) mediated coupling reactions involving persistent ketyl radicals have emerged as a promising strategy to assemble highly crowded carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Nevertheless, achieving enantioselectivity in these reactions remains highly challenging. In this work, we report our recent progress in controlling enantioselectivity for relay coupling of perfluoroalkyl and persistent vinylogous ketyl radicals. We developed a chiral bifunctional NHC&#8208;squaramide catalyst that achieves high facial selectivity in a critical bond&#8208;forming event involving the coupling of a congested tertiary carbon radical and vinylogous ketyl radical. Chiral carboxylates bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at the &#946;&#8208;position can be prepared in good yield and excellent enantiomeric excess. Results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments indicate that the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl squaramide motif adopts an unusual syn&#8208;syn conformation, enabling hydrogen bonding interactions with the enolate oxygen, thereby rigidifying the overall conformation of the transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Light and Guest&#160;Responsive Behavior in a Porous Coordination Network Enabled by Reversible [2 + 2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents that undergo reversible structural transformations induced by external stimuli (e.g. light, guests, or heat) offer the promise of utility in gas storage and separation. Whereas reports on guest or light&#8208;responsive sorbents have increased in recent years, we are unaware of reports on sorbents that exhibit both light and guest&#8208;induced structural transformations. Herein, we report that the square lattice, sql, topology coordination network Zn(fba)(bis)&#1632;2DMF (sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;a, 5 = trans&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)stilbene = bis, 6 = 2,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane = H2fba) underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation (SCSC) upon activation, affording nonporous sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;b. Parallel alignment at 3.23 &#197; of olefinic moieties on adjacent bis ligands in sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;a enabled SCSC [2 + 2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV light (365 nm) or sunlight. sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945; thereby transformed to mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945;, which was subsequently activated to the narrow pore phase mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;b. sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;b and mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;b both exhibited S&#8208;shaped adsorption isotherms characteristic of guest&#8208;induced structural changes when exposed to CO2 at 195 K (type&#8208;F&#8208;IV and type F&#8208;I, respectively). Cycling experiments conducted upon sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;b reduced particle size after cycle 1 and induced transformation into a rare example of a shape memory coordination network, sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;g.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Constructing High&#8208;Performance Polymer Electrolytes via Anion Modification and Click Chemistry for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes play a crucial role in advancing rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) owing to their exceptional characteristics, including high flexibility, superior interface compatibility, broad electrochemical stability window, and enhanced safety features. Despite these advantages, research in this domain remains nascent, plagued by single preparation approaches and challenges associated with the compatibility between polymer electrolytes and Mg metal anode. In this study, we present a novel synthesis strategy to fabricate a glycerol &#945;,&#945;'&#8208;diallyl ether&#8208;3,6&#8208;dioxa&#8208;1,8&#8208;octanedithiol&#8208;based polymer electrolyte supported by glass fiber substrate (GDT@GF) through anion modification and thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry polymerization. The developed route exhibits novelty and high efficiency, leading to the production of GDT@GF membranes featuring exceptional mechanical properties, heightened ionic conductivity, elevated Mg2+ transference number, and commendable compatibility with Mg anode. The assembled modified Mo6S8||GDT@GF||Mg cells exhibit outstanding performance across a wide temperature range and address critical safety concerns, showcasing the potential for applications under extreme conditions. Our innovative preparation strategy offers a promising avenue for the advancement of polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;performance rechargeable magnesium batteries, while also opens up possibilities for future large&#8208;scale applications and the development of flexible electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Multiple Sites Boosts Anti&#8208;Poisoning Hydrogen Electrooxidation Reaction with Ultrasmall     (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V    Ternary Intermetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity and poisoning tolerance of electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cell. However, it is severely hindered by the scaling relations among different intermediates. Herein, lattice&#8208;contracted Pt&#8208;Rh in ultrasmall ternary L12&#8208;(Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V intermetallic nanoparticles (~2.2 nm) were fabricated to promote the HOR performances through an oxides self&#8208;confined growth strategy. The prepared (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V displayed 5.5/3.7 times promotion in HOR mass/specific activity than Pt/C in pure H2 and dramatically limited activity attenuation in 1000 ppm CO/H2 mixture. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra tracked the superior anti&#8208;CO* capability as a result of compressive strained Pt, and the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing species was promoted due to the dual&#8208;functional effect. Further assisted by density functional theory calculations, both the adsorption of H* and CO* on (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V were reduced compared with that of Pt due to lattice contraction, while the adsorption of OH* was enhanced by introducing oxyphilic Rh sites. This work provides an effective tactic to stimulate the electrocatalytic performances by optimizing the adsorption of different intermediates severally.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Acid Enabled Comprehensive Training of Poly (Sodium Acrylate) Hydrogel NetworksStrong Acid Enabled Comprehensive Training of Poly (Sodium Acrylate) Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of admire hydrogel networks is of both practical and fundamental importance for diverse applications of hydrogels. Herein a general strategy of acid&#8208;assisted training is designed to enable multiple improvement of conventional poly (sodium acrylate) networks for hydrogels. Hydrophobic homogeneous crosslinked poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels are prepared to verify the strategy. The acid&#8208;assisted training is simply achieved by immersing the hydrogel networks into 4 M H2SO4 solutions. The introduced acids would induce transformation of poly (sodium acrylate) into poly (acrylic acid) at hydrogel surface, which constructs dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions to tighten the network. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, and show mechanical improvement. The internal poly (sodium acrylate) of the pristine acid&#8208;containing hydrogels is further fully transformed via acid&#8208;infiltration after following cyclic stretch/release training to significantly improve the mechanical performance. The Young&#8217;s modulus, stress, and toughness of the fully&#8208;trained hydrogels are 187.6 times, 35.6 times, and 5.4 times enhanced, respectively. The polymeric networks retain isotropic in fully&#8208;trained hydrogels to ensure superior stretchability of 8.6. The acid&#8208;assisted training performance of the hydrogels can be reversibly recovered by NaOH neutralization. The acid&#8208;assisted training strategy here is general for poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Miscibility of Polymer Donor and Polymer Acceptor by Reducing Chain Entanglement for Realizing 18.64% Efficiency All Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells have experienced rapid development in recent years by the emergence of polymerized small molecular acceptors (PSMAs). However, the strong chain entanglements of polymer donors (PDs) and polymer acceptors (PAs) decrease the miscibility of the resulting polymer mixtures, making it challenging to optimize the blend morphology. Herein, we designed three PAs, namely PBTPICm&#8208;BDD, PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD, by smartly using a BDD unit as the polymerized unit to copolymerize with different Y&#8208;typed non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs), thus achieving a certain degree of distortion and giving the polymer system enough internal space to reduce the entanglements of the polymer chains. Such effects increase the chances of the PD being interspersed into the acceptor material, which improve the solubility between the PD and PA. The PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD displayed better miscibility with PBQx&#8208;TCl, leading to a well optimized morphology. As a result, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.50% and 17.17% were achieved for PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBTPICF&#8208;BDD devices, respectively. With the addition of PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o as the third component into PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD blend to further extend the absorption spectral coverage and finely tune microstructures of the blend morphology, a remarkable PCE of 18.64% was realized finally.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Molecular Engineering for Fully Textured Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing large&#8208;scale monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on industrial Czochralski silicon wafers will likely have to adopt double&#8208;side textured architecture, given their optical benefits and low manufacturing costs. However, the surface engineering strategies that are widely used in solution&#8208;processed perovskites to regulate the interface properties are not directly applicable to micrometric textures. Here, we devise a surface passivation strategy by dynamic spray coating (DSC) &#64258;uorinated thiophenethylammonium ligands, combining the advantages of providing conformal coverage and suppressing phase conversion on textured surfaces. From the viewpoint of molecular engineering, theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that introducing trifluoromethyl group provide more effective surface passivation through strong interaction and energy alignment by forming a  dipole layer. Consequently, the DSC treatment of this bifunctional molecule enables the tandem cells based on industrial silicon wafers to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 30.89%. In addition, encapsulated devices display excellent operational stability by retaining over 97% of their initial performance after 600&#8201;h continuous illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Single Atom/Nanoparticle Ensemble for Efficient Photochemical Cascade Synthesis of Ethylene from Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis presents a promising approach for the activation and conversion of methane (CH4) into  high value&#8208;added chemicals under ambient conditions. However, the high C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy of CH4 and the absence of well&#8208;defined C&#8722;H activation sites on catalysts significantly limit the highly efficient conversion of CH4 toward multicarbon (C2+) hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene (C2H4). Herein, we demonstrate a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade conversion of CH4 into C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs, upon effecting key bond&#8208;breaking and &#8208;forming events, lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation. This work offers a novel perspective on the advancement of photocatalytic directional CH4 conversion toward high value&#8208;added C2+ hydrocarbons through the subtle design of bimetallic cascade catalyst strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Silver(I)&#8208;Containing i&#8208;Motif DNA Hybrid Catalyst for Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherent chiral structures of DNA serve as attractive scaffolds to construct DNA hybrid catalysts for valuable enantioselective transformations. Duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis has made great progress, yet novel design strategies of DNA hybrid catalysts are highly demanding and atomistic analysis of active centers is still challenging. DNA i&#8208;motif structures could be finely tuned by different cytosine&#8208;cytosine base pairs, providing a new platform to design DNA catalysts. Herein, we found that a human telomeric i&#8208;motif DNA containing cytosine&#8208;silver(I)&#8208;cytosine (C&#8208;Ag+&#8208;C) base pairs interacting with Cu(II) ions (i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+) could catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with full conversions and up to 95% enantiomeric excess. As characterized by various physicochemical techniques, the presence of Ag+ is proved to replace the protons in hemiprotonated cytosine&#8208;cytosine (C:C+) base pairs and stabilize the DNA i&#8208;motif to allow the acceptance of Cu(II) ions. The i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+ catalyst shows about 8&#8208;fold rate acceleration compared with DNA and Cu2+. Based on DNA mutation experiments, thermodynamic studies and density function theory calculations, the catalytic center of Cu(II) ion is proposed to be located in a specific loop region via binding to one nitrogen&#8208;7 atom of an unpaired adenine and two phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms from nearby deoxythymidine monophosphate and deoxyadenosine monophosphate, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Supramolecular Assembly of Simple Monomers Enabled by Confinement: Towards Aqueous Phase Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of supramolecular assembly (SA) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous phase has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields. However, using simple molecules with crystalline RTP to construct SA with aqueous phase RTP is hardly possible from the standpoint of forces. The reason lies in that the transition from crystal to SA involves a structure transformation from highly stable to more dynamic state, leading to increased non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathways and silent RTP signal. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple molecules (benzene derivatives) can successfully form metastable SA with aqueous phase RTP. The maximum of RTP lifetime and efficiency can reach 654.87 ms and 5.02%, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal the LDH energy trap can strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional monomer, facilitating the development of SAs with aqueous phase RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridazine&#8208;Promoted Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Exceptional Capability of Stepwise Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we successfully developed two novel vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine through Knoevenagel condensation. These COFs featured finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;scale pore sizes, high surface areas and stable non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages. Finely resolved powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns demonstrated highly crystalline structures with a hexagonal lattice in the AA layer stacking. The resulting one&#8208;dimensional channels possess strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting sites arising from the decorated cis&#8208;azo/azine units with two pairs of fully exposed lone pair electrons, endowing the as&#8208;prepared COFs with exceptional water absorption properties. The g&#8208;DZPH&#8208;COF exhibited successive steep water uptake steps starting from low relative pressures (P/PSTA = 0.1), with the remarkable water uptake capacity of 0.26 g/g at P/PSTA = 0.2 (25&#176;C), which is the optimal value recorded among the reported COFs. Dynamic vapour sorption measurements revealed the fast kinetics of these COFs, even in the cluster formation process. Water uptake and release cycling tests demonstrated their outstanding hydrolytic stability, durability, and adsorption&#8211;desorption retention ability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we successfully developed two novel vinylene-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using 2-connected 3,6-dimethylpyridazine through Knoevenagel condensation.
