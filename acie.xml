         <title>Chemoproteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals that O&#8208;GlcNAc Regulates Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Fate through the Pluripotency Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are influenced by protein O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) modification, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we report the identification of 979 O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins and 1,340 modification sites in mouse ESCs (mESCs) by using a chemoproteomics method. In addition to OCT4 and SOX2, the third core pluripotency transcription factor (PTF) NANOG was found to be modified and functionally regulated by O&#8208;GlcNAc. Upon differentiation along the neuronal lineage, the O&#8208;GlcNAc stoichiometry at 123 sites of 83 proteins&#8212;several of which were PTFs&#8212;was found to decline. Transcriptomic profiling reveals 2,456 differentially expressed genes responsive to OGT inhibition during differentiation, of which 901 are target genes of core PTFs. By acting on the core PTF network, suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation upregulates neuron&#8208;related genes, thus contributing to the mESC fate determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Arylation of Aliphatic Tertiary Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide is one of the most widespread functional groups in organic and bioorganic chemistry, and it would be valuable to achieve stereoselective C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization in amide molecules. Palladium(II) catalysis has been prevalently used in the C&#8208;H activation chemistry in the past decades, however, due to the weakly&#8208;coordinating feature of simple amides, it is challenging to achieve their direct C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization with enantiocontrol by Pd(II) catalysis. Our group has developed sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) ligands, which exhibited remarkable activity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H activation. In this work, we demonstrate that chiral SOHP ligands served as an ideal solution to enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H activation in simple amides. Herein, we report an efficient asymmetric Pd(II)/SOHP&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of aliphatic tertiary amides, in which the SOHP ligand plays a key role in the stereoselective C&#8208;H deprotonation&#8208;metalation step.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Molecular Switch Toward Texture&#8208;Regulated Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn electrodes in aqueous media exhibit an unstable Zn/electrolyte interface due to severe parasitic reactions and dendrite formation. Here, a dynamic Zn interface modulation based on the molecular switch strategy is reported by hiring &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) in ZnCl2/H2O electrolyte. During Zn plating, the increased interfacial alkalinity triggers molecular switch from GBL to &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). GHB strongly anchors on Zn surface via triple Zn&#8211;O bonding, leading to suppressive hydrogen evolution and texture&#8208;regulated Zn morphology. Upon Zn stripping, the fluctuant pH turns the molecular switch reaction off through the cyclization of GHB to GBL. This dynamic molecular switch strategy enables high Zn reversibility with Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% and Zn||iodine batteries with high&#8208;cyclability under high Zn depth of discharge (50%). This study demonstrates the importance of dynamic modulation for Zn electrode and realizes the reversible molecular switch strategy to enhance its reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Conjugate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric conjugate reduction (ACR) reactions have emerged over the last decades as straightforward and powerful transformations that provide direct access to chiral building blocks bearing ubiquitous trisubstituted stereocenters. This comprehensive Review focuses on the three areas of catalysis that contributed the most to the development of ACR chemistry: transition&#8208;metal, organic, and enzymatic catalysis.







Abstract
Enantioselective reduction reactions are privileged transformations for the construction of trisubstituted stereogenic centers. While these include established synthetic strategies, such as asymmetric hydrogenation, methods based on the enantioselective addition of hydridic reagents to electrophilic prochiral substrates have also gained importance. In this context, the asymmetric conjugate reduction (ACR) of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds has become a convenient approach for the synthesis of chiral compounds with trisubstituted stereocenters in &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, or &#947;&#8208;position to electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups. Because such activating groups are diverse and amenable of further derivatizations, ACRs provide a general and powerful synthetic entry towards a variety of valuable chiral building blocks. This Review provides a comprehensive collection of catalytic ACR methods involving transition&#8208;metal, organic, and enzymatic catalysis since its first versions dating back to the late 1970s.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of the multi&#8208;module concept and solvent&#8208;free synthesis method has led to the synthesis of super&#8208;stable MOFs by a route free from additive, modulator, solvent, or activation. They combine the advantages of structural complexity and green chemistry and show good C2H2/CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;module design of framework materials with multiple distinct building blocks has attracted much attention because such materials are more amenable to compositional and geometrical tuning and thus offer more opportunities for property optimization. Few examples are known that use environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective solvent&#8208;free method to synthesize such materials. Here, we report the use of solvent&#8208;free method (also modulator&#8208;free) to synthesize a series of multi&#8208;module MOFs with high stability and separation property for C2H2/CO2. The synthesis only requires simple mixing of reactants and short reaction time (2&#8197;h). Highly porous and stable materials can be made without any post&#8208;synthetic activation. The success of solvent&#8208;free synthesis of multi&#8208;module MOFs reflects the synergy between different modules, resulting in stable pore&#8208;partitioned materials, despite the fact that other competitive crystallization pathways with simpler framework compositions also exist.

         <title>Reversible Single Electron Redox Steps Convert Polycycles with a C3P3 Core to a Planar Triphosphinine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the biradicaloid IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords polycyclic compounds with a formally dianionic C3P3 core, which are in a dynamic equilibrium. The reversible, stepwise oxidation by two electrons leads to a planar triphosphinine with an aromatic 6&#960;&#8208;electron system. A monocyclic 7&#960;&#8208;electron could be isolated as intermediate.







Abstract
Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;stabilized diphosphete&#8208;diide IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords a mixture which contains the molecules 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b with a central C3P3 core, which formally carries a two&#8208;fold negative charge. In order to avoid the formation of an antiaromatic 8&#960; electron system within a conjugated dianionic six&#8208;membered [C3P3]2&#8722; ring, 1&#8201;a adopts a bicyclic [3.1.0] and 1&#8201;b a tricyclic [2.2.0.0] structure which are in a dynamic equilibrium. 1&#8201;a,&#8201;b can be reversibly oxidized to a triphosphinine dication [5]2+ with a central flat aromatic six&#8208;membered C3P3 ring. This two&#8208;electron redox reaction occurs in two single&#8208;electron transfer steps via the 7&#960;&#8208;radical cation [4]&#8901;+, which could also be isolated and fully characterized. The profound reversible structural change observed for the two&#8208;electron redox couple [5]2+/1&#8201;a,&#8201;b is in sharp contrast to the C6H6/[C6H6]2&#8722; couple, which undergoes only a modest structural deformation.

&lt;p&gt;Reaction of the biradicaloid &lt;b&gt;IDP&lt;/b&gt; with trityl phosphaalkyne affords polycyclic compounds with a formally dianionic C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; core, which are in a dynamic equilibrium. The reversible, stepwise oxidation by two electrons leads to a planar triphosphinine with an aromatic 6&#960;-electron system. A monocyclic 7&#960;-electron could be isolated as intermediate.

         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;flexible hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with a guest&#8208;induced reversible crystallinity was designed by Yingjie Zhao and Danbo Wang in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217903). The specific molecule, such as hexane, acts as a &#8220;key&#8221; to control the crystallinity, while the triangle macrocycle as the building module is the &#8220;lock&#8221;. The introduction and removal of the &#8220;key&#8221; molecule affects the local flexibility of the whole framework and leads to switchable crystallinity.

         <title>Ester Reduction with H2 on Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Acid Catalysts: Implications of Metal Identity on Rates and Selectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabling sustainable and continuous processes for ether production from bioderived esters on bifunctional solid catalysts: esters hydrogenate to hemiacetals on Pd, Rh, and Pt nanoparticles and diffuse to nearby Br&#248;nsted acids sites to form ethers or alcohols. Ester reduction rates are determined by H* addition to the C=O bond on metal sites and cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds on acid sites.







Abstract
Esters reduce to form ethers and alcohols on contact with metal nanoparticles supported on Br&#248;nsted acidic faujasite (M&#8208;FAU) that cleave C&#8722;O bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathways. Rates and selectivities for each pathway depend on the metal identity (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt). Pt&#8208;FAU gives propyl acetate consumption rates up to 100 times greater than other M&#8208;FAU catalysts and provides an ethyl propyl ether selectivity of 34&#8201;%. Measured formation rates, kinetic isotope effects, and site titrations suggest that ester reduction involves a bifunctional mechanism that implicates the stepwise addition of H* atoms to the carbonyl to form hemiacetals on the metal sites, followed by hemiacetal diffusion to a nearby Br&#248;nsted acid site to dehydrate to ethers or decompose to alcohol and aldehyde. The rates of reduction of propyl acetate appear to be determined by the H* addition to the carbonyl and by the C&#8722;O cleavage of hemiacetal.

         <title>Dynamically Resettable Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface through Supramolecular Sol&#8208;Gel Transition Electrolyte for Flexible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible batteries based on gel electrolytes with high safety are promising power solutions for wearable electronics but suffer from vulnerable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces especially upon complex deformations, leading to irreversible capacity loss or even battery collapse. Here, a supramolecular sol&#8208;gel transition electrolyte (SGTE) that can dynamically accommodate deformations and repair electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces through its controllable rewetting at low temperatures is designed. Mediated by the micellization of polypropylene oxide blocks in Pluronic and host&#8208;guest interactions between &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) and polyethylene oxide blocks, the high ionic conductivity and compatibility with various salts of SGTE afford resettable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and thus constructions of a series of highly durable, flexible aqueous zinc batteries. The design of this novel gel electrolyte provides new insights for the development of flexible batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Amorphization in 2D materials: Mechanism and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2)&#8208;assisted chemical and material processing has shown great success in fabrication of 2D amorphous materials, while the amorphization mechanism in SC CO2 is quite complicated to be understand. In this review, we introduce different kinds of 2D amorphous materials prepared with SC CO2 and discuss the possible amorphization mechanism and how they affect the structures and properties of 2D materials. Their applications are further presented and discussed. In addition, the prospective of future development of SC CO2&#8208;assisted fabrication of 2D amorphous materials is also involved. The investigation of SC CO2 induced amorphization not only provides theoretic understanding of amorphization process, but also directs to the preparation and application of 2D amorphous materials with specific structure and property, suggesting the promising future of SC CO2&#8208;assisted process in material design and engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Framework Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Nanotrap for the Precise Recognition and Separation of Gold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing weak interactions to effectively recover and separate precious metals in solution is of great importance but the practice remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy to achieve precise recognition and separation of gold by regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) nanotrap within the pore of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that both COF&#8208;HNU25 and COF&#8208;HNU26 can efficiently capture Au(III) with fast kinetics, high selectivity, and uptake capacity. In particular, the COF&#8208;HNU25 with the high density of H&#8208;bond nanotraps exhibits an excellent gold uptake capacity of 1725 mg/g, which is significantly higher than that (219 mg/g) of its isostructural COF (COF&#8208;42) without H&#8208;bond nanostrap in the pores. Importantly, the uptake capacity is strongly correlated to the number of H&#8208;bonds between phenolic OH in the COF and [AuCl4]&#8208; in water, and multiple H&#8208;bond interactions are the key driving force for the excellent gold recovery and reusability of the adsorbent.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPI) are essential for promoting electrochemical CO2 reduction, but it remains challenging to maximize their efficiency while integrating other desirable properties conducive to electrolysis.   Herein, we report the elaborate design and fabrication of a superhydrophobic, conductive, and hierarchical wire membrane in which core&#8208;shell CuO nanospheres, carbon nanotubes (CNT), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are integrated into a wire structure (designated as CuO/F/C(w)  ; F, PTFE; C, CNT; w, wire ) to maximize their respective functions. The realized architecture allows almost all CuO nanospheres to be exposed with effective TPI and good contact to conductive CNT, thus increasing the local CO2 concentration on the CuO surface and enabling fast electron/mass transfer. As a result, the CuO/F/C(w) membrane attains a Faradaic efficiency of 56.8% and a partial current density of 68.9 mA cm&#8208;2 for multicarbon products at &#8208;1.4 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in the H&#8208;type cell, far exceeding 10.1% and 13.4 mA cm&#8208;2 for bare CuO.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Polymerization via C&#8211;H Activation for the Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their versatile (opto)electronic properties, conjugated polymers have found application in several organic electronic devices. Cross&#8208;coupling reactions such as Stille, Suzuki, Kumada couplings, and direct arylation reactions have proved to be effective for their synthesis. More atom&#8208;efficient oxidative direct arylation polymerization has also been reported for making homopolymers. However, growing interest toward donor&#8208;acceptor polymers has led to the recent emergence of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) polymerization to synthesize alternating copolymers without any prefunctionalization of monomers. Metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two simple arenes via double C&#8211;H activation, or of an arene with an alkene via oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction have been used so far for CDC polymerization. In this article, we discuss the development of CDC polymerization protocols along with the relevant small molecule CDC reactions for an improved understanding of these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Size Limitation of Directly&#8208;Synthesized PbS Quantum Dot Inks Toward Efficient Short&#8208;wavelength Infrared Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PbS quantum dots (QDs) are promising building blocks for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) devices. The recently developed direct synthesis of semi&#8208;conductive PbS QD inks has substantially simplified the preparation processing and reduced the material cost, while facing the challenge to synthesize large&#8208;size QDs with absorption covering the SWIR region. Herein, we for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of SWIR PbS QD inks after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Finally, based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, the solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.44% through an 1100 nm cutoff silicon filter and the photodetector device shows a low dark current density of 2 &#215; 10&#8208;6 A cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.8 V reverse bias with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 70% at ~1300 nm. Our results realize the direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks and may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Makes a Difference: Molecular Ionic Bismuth Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Key challenges in modern synthetic chemistry include the design of reliable, selective, and more sustainable synthetic methods, as well as the development of promising candidates for new materials. Molecular bismuth compounds offer valuable opportunities as they show an intriguing spectrum of properties that is yet to be fully exploited: a soft character, a rich coordination chemistry, the availability of a broad variety of oxidation states (at least +V to &#8211;I) and formal charges (at least +3 to &#8211;3) at the Bi atoms, and reversible switching between multiple oxidation states. All this is paired with the status of a non&#8208;precious (semi&#8208;)metal of good availability and a tendency towards low toxicity. Recent findings show that some of these properties only come into reach, or can be substantially optimized, when charged compounds are specifically addressed. In this review, essential contributions to the synthesis, analyses, and utilization of ionic bismuth compounds are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond activation&#8208;assisted meta&#8208;C&#8208;&#8208;H functionalization has emerged as a useful tool to forge distal C&#8211;C bonds. However, given the limited number of mechanistic studies, a clear understanding of the origin of the site&#8208;selectivity and the complete reaction pattern is not available. Here, we present systematic computational studies on ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl bromides and aryl bromides. The C&#8211;H scission and the C&#8211;C formation were carefully examined. Monocyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes were identified as the active species, which then underwent inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer (ISET) to activate the organic bromides. The site&#8208;selectivity results from the competition between the close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and the open&#8208;shell radical coupling. Based on this mechanistic understanding, a multilinear regression model was built to predict the site&#8208;selectivity, which was further validated by experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Trisubstituted Carbocyclic Olefins: An Access to Chiral Cyclic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic enamides has been achieved using an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. Using CoCl2/(S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE, several trisubstituted carbocyclic enamides were reduced with high activity and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99%) to the corresponding saturated amides. The methodology can be extended to the synthesis of chiral amines by base hydrolysis of the hydrogenation products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal the presence of a high spin cobalt (II) species in the catalytic cycle. We propose that the hydrogenation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond proceeds via a sigma&#8208;bond&#8208;metathesis pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Acetylene Enabled by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the direct conversion of gaseous acetylene into value&#8208;added liquid commodity chemicals is becoming increasingly attractive, the majority of the established methodologies are focused on cross&#8208;coupling, hydro&#8208;functionalization, and polymerization. Herein, we describe a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization method that inserts acetylene directly into readily available bifunctional reagents. This method provides access to diverse C2&#8208;linked 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;heteroatom products in high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity along with opening up previously unexplored synthetic directions. In addition, we demonstrate this method&#8217;s synthetic potential by converting the obtained products into diverse functionalized molecules and chiral sulfoxide&#8208;containing bidentate ligands. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, the mechanism for this insertion reaction was investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>The First UV Nonlinear Optical Selenite Material: Fluorination Control in CaYF(SeO3)2 and Y3F(SeO3)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to develop UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material due to the demanding conditions of strong second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and wide band gap. The first ultraviolet NLO selenite material, Y3F(SeO3)4, has been obtained by control of the fluorine content in a centrosymmetric CaYF(SeO3)2. The two new compounds represent similar 3D structures composed of 3D yttrium open frameworks strengthened by selenite groups. CaYF(SeO3)2 has a large birefringence (0.138@532 nm and 0.127@1064 nm) and a wide optical bandgap (5.06 eV). The non&#8208;centrosymmetric Y3F(SeO3)4 can exhibit strong SHG intensity (5.5&#215;KDP@1064 nm), wide band gap (5.03 eV), short UV cut&#8208;off edge (204 nm) and high thermal stability (690 &#8451;). So, Y3F(SeO3)4 is a new UV NLO material with excellent comprehensive properties. Our work shows that it is an effective method to develop new UV NLO selenite material by fluorination control of the centrosymmetric compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of secondary alcohols, primary alcohols and methanol for the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;methylated/alkylated secondary alcohols. Using our method, a series of 1&#8208;arylethanol, benzyl alcohol derivatives, and methanol undergo sequential coupling efficiently to construct assembled alcohols with high chemoselectivity in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via methylation of a benzylated secondary alcohol intermediate to generate the final product.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Complexes in Anticancer Therapy: From New Design Principles to Particle&#8208;Based Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of the medicinal properties of gold complexes has fuelled the design and synthesis of new anticancer metallodrugs, which have received special attention due to their unique modes of action. Current research in the development of gold compounds with therapeutic properties is predominantly focused on the molecular design of drug leads with superior pharmacological properties, e.g., by introducing targeting features. Moreover, intensive research aims at improving the physicochemical properties of gold compounds, such as chemical stability and solubility in the physiological environment. In this regard, the encapsulation or chemical grafting of gold compounds to targeted delivery vectors/materials could lead to new nanomedicines eventually reaching clinical applications. Herein, we provide an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of gold anticancer compounds but more importantly we thoroughly revise the development of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems for gold chemotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupled Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural photosynthesis (NP) generates oxygen and carbohydrates from water and CO2 utilizing solar energy to nourish lives and balance CO2 levels. Following nature, artificial photosynthesis (AP), typically, overall water or CO2 splitting, produces fuels and chemicals from renewable energy. However, hydrogen evolution or CO2 reduction is inherently coupled with kinetically sluggish water oxidation, lowering efficiencies and raising safety concerns. Decoupled systems have thus emerged. In this review, we elaborate how decoupled artificial photosynthesis (DAP) evolves from NP and AP and unveil their distinct photoelectrochemical mechanisms in energy capture, transduction and conversion. Advances of AP and DAP are summarized in terms of photochemical (PC), photoelectrochemical (PEC), and photovoltaic&#8208;electrochemical (PV&#8208;EC) catalysis based on material and device design. The energy transduction process of DAP is emphasized. Challenges and perspectives on future researches are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast One&#8208;Handed Helix Induction and Its Static Helicity Memory in a Poly(biphenylylacetylene) with a Catalytic Amount of Chiral Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and its static helicity memory in a poly(biphenylylacetylene) are achieved using chiral ammonium salts, as reported by Katsuhiro Maeda, Eiji Yashima, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217020). The remarkable acceleration of the helix&#8208;induction rate accompanied by strong chiral amplification relies on crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like specific intermolecular complex formation of the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants with chiral ammoniums.

         <title>Camouflaged Virus&#8208;Like&#8208;Nanocarrier with a Transformable Rough Surface for Boosting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocarrier with variable surface roughness was designed. At physiological pH, the virus&#8208;like spikes are hidden by a polymer shell, which effectively inhibits the non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interaction between the nanocarrier and protein/normal tissue induced by the rough surface. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, the nanocarrier sheds the polymer camouflage to re&#8208;expose its rough surface, thus promoting endocytosis of the nanocarrier by tumor cells.







Abstract
Due to non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interactions, it is difficult for nanocarriers with permanent rough surface to cross multiple biological barriers to realize efficient drug delivery. Herein, a camouflaged virus&#8208;like&#8208;nanocarrier with a transformable rough surface is reported, which is composed by an interior virus&#8208;like mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticle with a rough surface (vSiO2) and an exterior acid&#8208;responsive polymer. Under normal physiological pH condition, the spikes on vSiO2 are hidden by the polymer shell, and the non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interactions are effectively inhibited. While in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the nanocarrier sheds the polymer camouflage to re&#8208;expose its rough surface. So, the retention ability and endocytosis efficiency of the nanocarrier are great improved. Owing to it's the dynamically variable rough surface, the rationally designed nanocarrier exhibits extended blood&#8208;circulation&#8208;time and enhanced tumor accumulation.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;mediated Aqueous Synthesis of NIR&#8208;II Emitting Ag2S Quantum Dots for Rapid Photocatalytic Bacteria Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs were successfully synthesized based on a silver&#8208;binding polypeptide AgBP2 under mild conditions and served as photothermal agents for antibacterial activity. Owing to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS and hyperthermia, the obtained AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs exhibited an effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06&#8201;% against E.&#8197;coli within 25&#8197;min of NIR irradiation.







Abstract
Pathogenic microorganisms in the environment are a great threat to global human health. The development of disinfection method with rapid and effective antibacterial properties is urgently needed. In this study, a biomimetic silver binding peptide AgBP2 was introduced to develop a facile synthesis of biocompatible Ag2S quantum dots (QDs). The AgBP2 capped Ag2S QDs exhibited excellent fluorescent emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, with physical stability and photostability in the aqueous phase. Under 808&#8197;nm NIR laser irradiation, AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs can serve not only as a photothermal agent to realize NIR photothermal conversion but also as a photocatalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The obtained AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs achieved a highly effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06&#8201;% against Escherichia coli within 25&#8197;min of NIR irradiation, which was ascribed to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS during photocatalysis and hyperthermia. Our work demonstrated a promising strategy for efficient bacterial disinfection.

In this study, a biomimetic silver binding peptide AgBP2 was introduced to develop a facile synthesis of biocompatible Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S quantum dots (QDs). The AgBP2 capped Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S QDs exhibited excellent fluorescent emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window, with physical stability and photostability in the aqueous phase. Under 808&#8197;nm NIR laser irradiation, AgBP2-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S QDs can serve not only as a photothermal agent to realize NIR photothermal conversion but also as a photocatalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The obtained AgBP2-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S QDs achieved a highly effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06&#8201;% against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; within 25&#8197;min of NIR irradiation, which was ascribed to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS during photocatalysis and hyperthermia. Our work demonstrated a promising strategy for efficient bacterial disinfection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Supramolecular A8Bn Miktoarm Star Copolymers by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular A8Bn miktoarm star copolymers were fabricated by host&#8211;guest complexation between a cavitand&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene arms and biphenyl guest molecules with one, two, or four polymethyl acrylate arms, as reported by Takeharu Haino and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202219001). The stability of the A8B1, A8B2, and A8B4 miktoarm star polymers is influenced by the number of polymethyl acrylate arms of the guest polymers.

         <title>Enzymatic Electrosynthesis of Glycine from CO2 and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic electrocatalytic system was developed to allow the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 for glycine synthesis, as reported by Zhiguang Zhu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202218387). This system was inspired by the reductive glycine pathway in vivo and based on the in vitro multienzymatic cascade reaction, representing a novel alternative of the enzymatic CO2 electroreduction for synthesizing nitrogenous value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Rearrangement of Cyclic Ethynylethylene Carbonates: Synthetic Applications and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented copper&#8208;catalysed rearrangement of cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates has been discovered, and the in situ&#8208;formed allenal intermediates could react with a range of nucleophiles to furnish synthetically useful and highly functionalised products through the addition pathways. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the base&#8208;mediated deprotonation as the key step to induce the rearrangement.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed reactions of cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates have been intensively studied because of their robustness in new bond formation and diversified molecule construction. Known reaction modes usually involve a substitution step occurring at either the propargylic or terminal alkyne positions. Here, we report an unprecedented reaction pattern in which cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates first undergo a rearrangement to release allenal intermediates, which subsequently react with diverse nucleophiles to furnish synthetically useful allylic and propargylic allenols, phosphorus ylides, and cyclopropylidene ketones through an addition process rather than a substitution pathway. The products enable various further transformations, and mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the reaction does not proceed via a semipinacol type [1,2]&#8208;hydride shift, but through base&#8208;mediated deprotonation as the key step to induce the rearrangement.

         <title>Exfoliated 2D Layered and Nonlayered Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides Nanosheets as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered and nonlayered phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) are successfully exfoliated into ultra&#8208;thin metal nanosheets through wet grinding exfoliation (WGE). The systematic investigation of the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR) mechanism offers new insights for the understanding of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials catalysts provide an atomic&#8208;scale view on a fascinating arena for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR). Here, we successfully exfoliated both layered and nonlayered ultra&#8208;thin metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) nanosheets via wet grinding exfoliation (WGE), and systematically investigated the mechanism of MPCh3 as catalysts for CO2 ECR. Unlike the layered CoPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheets, the active Sn atoms tend to be exposed on the surfaces of nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets. Correspondingly, the nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets exhibit clearly improved catalytic activity, showing formic acid selectivity up to 31.6&#8201;% with &#8722;7.51&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE. The enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of HCOO* via the first proton&#8208;electron pair addition on the SnPS3 surface. These results provide a new avenue to understand the novel CO2 ECR mechanism of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Supramolecular Shish Kebabs: Higher Order Dimeric Structures from Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Complexes with Conformational Adaptivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple 2D H&#8208;bonded macrocycle are threaded onto a box&#8208;like cationic cyclophane, which further assembles into higher order dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like structures. Such ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) superstructures maximize their stability through the conformational adaptivity of both host and guest.







Abstract
Use of abiotic chemical systems for understanding higher order superstructures is challenging. Here we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system comprising a hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene) tetracation (o&#8208;Box) or cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetracation (CBPQT4+, p&#8208;Box) that assembles to construct discrete higher order structures with adaptive conformation. As indicated by mass spectrometry, computational modeling, NMR spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, this ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system features the box&#8208;directed aggregation of multiple macrocycles, leading to generation of several stable species such as H4G (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box) and H5G (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box). Remarkably, a dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings superstructure H7G2 (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box) or H8G2 (1&#8201;a/p&#8208;Box) is formed from the coaxial stacking of two ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings units. The formation of such unique dimeric superstructures is attributed to the large &#960;&#8208;surface of this 2D planar macrocycle and the conformational variation of both host and guest.

         <title>Highly Twisted Conformation Thiopyrylium Photosensitizers for In Vivo Near Infrared&#8208;II Imaging and Rapid Inactivation of Coronavirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between molecular configuration and charge transfer process in near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) chromophores is revealed, which subsequently instructed the engineering of an efficient NIR photosensitizer (PS), as reported by Yishen Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214875). The resulting NIR&#8208;II PS not only enables NIR&#8208;II image&#8208;guided in vivo pulmonary coronavirus photo&#8208;ablation but also demonstrates a facile approach for the development of NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs.

         <title>Determining the Physico&#8208;Chemical Composition of Biomolecular Condensates from Spatially&#8208;Resolved NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;Liquid phase separation has emerged as fundamental process underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates. Insights into the composition and structure of biomolecular condensates is, however, complicated by their molecular complexity and dynamics. Here, we introduce an improved spatially&#8208;resolved NMR experiment that enables quantitative analysis of the physico&#8208;chemical composition of multi&#8208;component biomolecular condensates in equilibrium and label&#8208;free. Application of spatially&#8208;resolved NMR to condensates formed by the Alzheimer&#8217;s disease&#8208;associated protein Tau demonstrates decreased water content, exclusion of the molecular crowding agent dextran, presence of a specific chemical environment of the small molecule DSS, and ~150&#8208;fold increased concentration of Tau inside the condensate. The results suggest that spatially&#8208;resolved NMR can have a major impact in understanding the composition and physical chemistry of biomolecular condensates.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Triflones Bearing Two Non&#8208;adjacent Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethylsulfones (triflones) are useful compounds for synthesis and beyond. Yet, methods to access chiral triflones are scarce. Here, we present a mild and efficient organocatalytic method for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral triflones using &#945;&#8208;aryl vinyl triflones, building blocks previously unexplored in asymmetric synthesis. The peptide&#8208;catalyzed reaction gives rise to a broad range of &#947;&#8208;triflylaldehydes with two non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. A catalyst&#8208;controlled stereoselective protonation following a C&#8211;C bond formation is key to control over the absolute and relative configuration. Straightforward derivatization of the products into, e.g., disubstituted &#948;&#8208;sultones, &#947;&#8208;lactones, and pyrrolidine heterocycles highlights the synthetic versatility of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Salts as Dual&#8208;Function Reagents for Carboxylation and Carbon Isotope Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium salt of triphenylacetic acid is developed as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. This method avoids specialized equipment and is used in the carboxylation of a range of compound classes. This provides a mechanistically distinct approach to carboxylation that has also been applied in carbon isotope labeling.







Abstract
The potassium salts of carboxylic acids are developed as efficient carboxylating agents through CO2 exchange. We describe these carboxylates as dual&#8208;function reagents because they function as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. By using the salt of a commercially available carboxylic acid, this protocol overcomes difficulties when using CO2 gas or organometallic reagents, such as pressurized containers or strictly inert conditions. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, does not require transition metals or other additives, and shows broad substrate scope. Through the preparation of several biologically important molecules, we show how this strategy provides an opportunity for isotope labeling with low equivalents of labeled CO2.

         <title>Spontaneous Proton Chemistry  Enables Ultralow&#8208;temperature and Long&#8208;life Aqueous Copper Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous copper metal batteries with acidic electrolytes are regarded as promising candidates for low&#8208;temperature energy storage, benefiting from the fast diffusion kinetics of protons and the good acid resistance of metallic copper. Here, a copper tetrafluoroborate electrolyte that spontaneously generates protons is developed for ultralow&#8208;temperature copper metal batteries. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis demonstrate that more protons are generated due to the hydrolysis of anions, rendering the copper tetrafluoroborate electrolyte among the most effective aqueous electrolyte capable of breaking the hydrogen bond network of water molecules.This electrolyte endows a polyaniline/Cu battery to deliver a short charging time of 21 s and a charge/discharge capability of up to 10 A g&#8208;1 at &#8208;30 &#176;C, along with a high discharge specific capacity of 70 mAh g&#8208;1 and a supercapacitor&#8208;comparable power density of 3000 W kg&#8208;1. Furthermore, it can still exhibit a extra&#8208;long and stable cycling lifespan over 10000 cycles at &#8208;50 &#176;C, and works well even at &#8208;70 &#176;C. This work is the first demonstration of aqueous copper metal battery at a frozen environment, while providing opportunities for intrinsically acidic electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Carbon Monoxide: Ketenyl Anions by PPh3/CO Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketenes (R2C=C=O) are important reactive intermediates in organic chemistry which are often challenging to access as stable compounds due to their polarized cumulenic structure and inherent high reactivity. Ketenyl anions (R(M)C=C=O) or metal ynolates (R&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;OM) represent alternative, highly attractive synthetic targets, but are typically prepared in situ and their structure and synthetic access is little investigated. Now, a fundamental new strategy utilizing an exchange reaction of a phosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide gives rise to a series of novel ketenyl anions. These compounds are flexible reagents and can easily be transferred with electrophiles into more complex building blocks for synthetic applications. Since carbon monoxide is an inexpensive C1 building block the new exchange strategy is an elegant concept and a valuable new entry in the synthetic tool&#8208;box of organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Enzymatic Synthesis of dTDP&#8208;Activated Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Transforming Inert Cycloalkanes into &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Diamines by&#160;Designed Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines (DAs) are important monomer precursors that are industrially produced by energy&#8208;intensive, multistage chemical reactions that are harmful to the environment. Therefore, the development of sustainable green DA synthetic routes is highly desired. Herein, we report an efficient one&#8208;pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the transformation of cycloalkanes into DAs with the aid of advanced techniques, including the RetroBioCat tool for biocatalytic route design, enzyme mining for finding appropriate enzymes and microbial consortia construction for efficient pathway assembly. As a result, DAs are successfully produced by the designed microbial consortia&#8208;based biocatalytic system, especially 1,6&#8208;hexanediamine. The highest biosynthesis productivity record was achieved when using either cyclohexanol or cyclohexane as substrate. Thus, the developed biocatalytic process provides a promising alternative to the dominant industrial process for manufacturing DAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating Swelling of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase using an Inorganic Anion Switch for Low&#8208;temperature Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In overcoming the Li+ desolvation barrier for low&#8208;temperature battery operation, a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte based on carboxylate solvent has shown promises. In case of an organic&#8208;anion&#8208;enriched primary solvation sheath (PSS), we found that the electrolyte tends to form a highly swollen, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that shows a high permeability to the electrolyte components, accounting for quickly declined electrochemical performance of graphite&#8208;based anode. Here we proposed a facile strategy to tune the swelling property of SEI by introducing an inorganic anion switch into the PSS, via LiDFP co&#8208;solute method. By forming a low&#8208;swelling, Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI, the electrolyte&#8208;consuming parasitic reactions and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at graphite&#8208;electrolyte interface are suppressed, which contributes to efficient Li+ transport, reversible Li+ (de)intercalation and stable structural evolution of graphite anode in high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries at a low temperature of &#8208;20 oC.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Acid/alkali All Covalent Organic Frameworks Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), thanks to their adjustable porous structure and abundant build&#8208;in functional motifs, have been recently regarded as promising electrode materials for a variety of batteries. There still remain grand opportunities to further utilizing their merits for developing advanced COFs&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. In such a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery, the cathodic COF favorably works in acid with a relatively positive potential, while the anodic COF preferably runs in alkali with a relatively negative potential. It thus can deliver a decently high discharge capacity of 92.97 mAh g&#8722;1 with a wide voltage window of 2.0 V, and exhibit high energy density of 74.2 Wh kg&#8722;1 along with a considerable cyclic stability over 300 cycles. The development of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept all&#8208;COFs battery may drive forward the improvement of newly cost&#8208;effective and performance&#8208;reliable energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical and General Alcohol Deoxygenation Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a practical protocol for the removal of alcohol functional groups through reductive cleavage of their benzoate ester analogs. This transformation requires a strong single electron transfer (SET) reductant and a means to accelerate slow fragmentation following substrate reduction. To accomplish this, we developed a photocatalytic system that generates a potent reductant from formate salts alongside Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids that promote fragmentation of the reduced intermediate. This deoxygenation procedure is effective across structurally and electronically diverse alcohols and enables a variety of difficult net transformations. This protocol requires no precautions to exclude air or moisture and remains efficient on multigram scale. Finally, the system can be adapted to a one&#8208;pot benzoylation&#8208;deoxygenation sequence to enable direct alcohol deletion. Mechanistic studies validate that the role of acidic additives is to promote the key C(sp3)&#8211;O bond fragmentation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free&#160;Regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8208;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridine core is among the most common motifs found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Consequently, the C&#8208;H functionalization of pyridine is a highly prized reaction, as it can help access a broad spectrum of value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridine hinder the meta&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of simple pyridines, necessitating drastic conditions affecting functional group compatibility. A synthetic manoeuvre which can help overcome this challenge involves the conversion of pyridines temporarily into electron&#8208;rich intermediates and subsequent regioselective electrophilic functionalization. This was recently accomplished by a ring&#8208;opening ring&#8208;closing sequence via Zincke imine intermediates by McNally and co&#8208;workers and a dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization sequence via oxazino&#8208;pyridine intermediates by the Studer group. The mildness and simplicity of these protocols enable them to tolerate highly sensitive functional groups in complex molecular setups for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroptosis Detection: From Approaches to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the molecular machinery regulating ferroptosis and leveraging this accumulating knowledge could facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The emerging approaches endowing in situ detection of the major regulators of ferroptosis at the cellular and tissue levels, and in living subjects, provide a multi&#8208;scale perspective to study ferroptosis. More importantly, ferroptosis&#8208;based applications integrating the rationality of ferroptosis detection with technological platforms have shown great promise in preclinical research. In this review, we first briefly summarized the mechanisms and key regulators involved in ferroptosis. Ferroptosis detection approaches were then presented to delineate their design, mechanisms of action, and applications. Special interest was placed on ferroptosis&#8208;based applications integrating multifunctional platforms. We hope that this review is timely to spur research interest in ferroptosis&#8208;based disease management.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating target proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system has recently expanded the scope of pharmacological inventions. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an auspicious target for immunotherapy. Seminal studies envisioned the importance of STING as well as the utility of its agonists in immunotherapy outcomes. Herein, we suggest UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein&#8208;protein interaction strategy) to pharmacologically increase cellular STING levels for improved immunotherapy. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING&#8211;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction, thus blocking TRIM29&#8208;induced degradation of STING. SB24011 enhanced STING immunity by upregulating STING protein levels, which robustly potentiated the immunotherapy efficacy of STING agonist and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody via systemic anticancer immunity. Overall, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING can be a promising approach for immuno&#8208;oncology.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modulating target proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system has recently expanded the scope of pharmacological inventions. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an auspicious target for immunotherapy. Seminal studies envisioned the importance of STING as well as the utility of its agonists in immunotherapy outcomes. Herein, we suggest UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein-protein interaction strategy) to pharmacologically increase cellular STING levels for improved immunotherapy. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING&#8211;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction, thus blocking TRIM29-induced degradation of STING. SB24011 enhanced STING immunity by upregulating STING protein levels, which robustly potentiated the immunotherapy efficacy of STING agonist and anti-PD-1 antibody via systemic anticancer immunity. Overall, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING can be a promising approach for immuno-oncology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosyl anomeric radical addition reactions have been well&#8208;explored and proved efficient for the C&#8208;alkyl glycosides synthesis, but multicomponent Domino transformations for the rapid and controllable construction of structurally diversified C&#8208;alkyl glycosides in a single step are still rare. In contrast, we, herein, report a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H ethyl glycosylation, enabling the construction of challenging meta&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides. Our ruthenium(II) catalysis was reflected by the mild reaction condition, exclusive meta&#8208;site selectivity and high levels of anomeric selectivity. In addition, the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation allowed for the synthesis of versatile 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with commercially available vinyl arenes, acrylates and easily accessible glycosyl bromides.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen Bonds Network Modulator of Bismuth&#8208;Antimony Complex Anode for Self&#8208;healable and Wider Temperature Adaptive Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony (Sb)&#8208;based anode is one of attracting candidates in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their super capacities and rational potassium inserting voltages. However, the sluggish kinetics, and poor interface compatibility especially at harsh conditions severely confine its practical application. Herein, Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanospheres closely embedded into the in&#8208;situ formed poly (3, 4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) intertwined polythioctic acid (PET@PTA) supramolecule polymer (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA) were elaborately conceptualized, whereas the interface environment was finely regulated via hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding&#160; (HBEB) sites. Comprehensive experimental evaluation and theoretical calculation corroborate that the flexible&#8208;robust Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA with stable sulphide radicals is enabled with prominent self&#8208;healing ability, high K+ ion transfer number of 0.84, and wider temperature adaptability, benefiting from additional binding sites and tailored spin state via smart hydrogen bonds exchange. Such Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA displays impressively reversible capacity of 819 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1, prominent cycle ability with a 73% capacity conservation after 500 loops at 2 A g&#8722;1, and extraordinary capacity retentions of 66%, 84% at &#8208;40 and 70&#8451;, respectively, for K+ ion storage. This work supplies a new perspective of HBEB sites in maximizing the desirable K+ storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction Enables Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Alkenes with Two Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely introducing two similar functional groups into bulk chemical alkenes represents a formidable route to complex molecules. Especially, the selective and progressive activation of two electrophiles is in crucial demand, yet challenging for cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling. Here, we demonstrate a redox&#8208;mediated electrolysis, in which aryl nitriles are both aryl radical precursors and redox&#8208;mediators, enables an intermolecular alkene 1,2&#8208;diarylation with a remarkable regioselectivity, thereby avoiding the requirement for transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This transformation leveraged cyanoarene radical anions for activating various aryl halides (including iodides, bromides, and even chlorides) and afforded 1,2&#8208;diarylation adducts in up to 83% yield and &gt; 20: 1 regioselectivity with more than 80 examples, proving a feasible approach to complex bibenzyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Chiral Resolution of Expanded Helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;Fused Benzene Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanded helicenes are expected to show enhanced chiroptical properties as compared to the classical helicenes but the synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of expanded helicenes Hn (n=1&#8208;4) containing 11, 19, 27 and 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings through Suzuki coupling&#8208;based oligomerization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Enantiopure H2, H3, and H4 can be isolated by chiral HPLC and they all exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) values (0.020 for H2, 0.021 for H3, and 0.021&#8208;0.024 for H4).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes is an important but challenging protocol to construct all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes. Particularly, the catalytic unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes remains as an underexplored task to date. We herein report an unprecedented unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation by simultaneously utilizing electrophilic trifluoromethyl alkene and nucleophilic allylboronate as the allylic reagents. With the aid of robust Ni(0)/NHC catalysis, valuable skipped trienes can be obtained in high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction may proceed through a &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination of a nickelacycle followed by a transmetalation step with allylboronate. The present method exhibits a good tolerance of various functional groups. Besides, the skipped triene products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Ether&#8208;Directed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Cyclopropanes Enabled by Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple ether&#8208;directed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanes was accomplished by CBL/iridium catalysis for the first time. The reported method features tolerance of a broad range of functional groups (38 examples), excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee), and high turnover numbers (up to 335).







Abstract
Reported here is an efficient and simple ether&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanes. Various functional groups were well&#8208;tolerated, affording a vast array of chiral cyclopropanes with high enantioselectivities. We also demonstrated that the turnover numbers of the current reaction could be up to 335.

         <title>Photoswitchable Oxidopyrylium Ylide for Photoclick Reaction with High Spatiotemporal Precision:&#160;Dynamic Switching Strategy to Compensate for Molecular Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a novel type of photoclick reaction between 2,3&#8208;diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) and ring&#8208;strained dipolarophiles, in which DIO serves as a P&#8208;type photoswitch to produce mesoionic oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) to initiate an ultra&#8208;fast [5+2] cycloaddition (k2h&#957; = 1.9 &#215; 105 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1). The photoisomerization between DIO and PY can be tightly controlled by either 365 or 520 nm photo&#8208;stimulation, which allows reversion or regeneration of the reactive PY dipole on demand. Thus, this reversible photoactivation was exploited to elevate chemoselectivity of the [5+2] cycloaddition in complex environments via temporal dual&#8208;&#955; stimulation sequences and to recycle the DIO reagent for batch&#8208;wise protein conjugation. A dynamic photoswitching strategy is also proposed to compensate for molecular diffusion of PY in aqueous, enhancing the spatialresolution of lithographic surface decoration and bioorthogonal labeling on living cells via a spatiotemporal dual&#8208;&#955; photo&#8208;modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Artificial Membraneless Organelles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae To Enhance Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial membraneless organelle (MLO) was designed to increase the production efficiency of fine chemicals by S.&#8197;cerevisiae. The size and rigidity of the membraneless organelles were adjusted to decrease the concentration of toxic formaldehyde and to induce a switch from oxidative glycolysis to non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis. Consequently, the methanol assimilation efficiency and the n&#8208;butanol yield increased significantly.







Abstract
Microbial cell factories provide a green and sustainable opportunity to produce value&#8208;added products from renewable feedstock. However, the leakage of toxic or volatile intermediates decreases the efficiency of microbial cell factories. In this study, membraneless organelles (MLOs) were reconstructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the disordered protein sequence A&#8208;IDPs. A regulation system was designed to spatiotemporally regulate the size and rigidity of MLOs. Manipulating the MLO size of strain ZP03&#8208;FM, the amounts of assimilated methanol and malate were increased by 162&#8201;% and 61&#8201;%, respectively. Furthermore, manipulating the MLO rigidity in strain ZP04&#8208;RB made acetyl&#8208;coA synthesis from oxidative glycolysis change to non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis; consequently, CO2 release decreased by 35&#8201;% and the n&#8208;butanol yield increased by 20&#8201;%. This artificial MLO provides a strategy for the co&#8208;localization of enzymes to channel C1 starting materials into value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Synthesis and Post&#8208;Processing of Chemically Homogeneous Nanothreads from 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ordered, functionalized carbon nanothreads remains a challenge. Herein we report the scalable solid&#8208;state polymerization of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting nanothread is functionalized with a high density of pendant carboxyl groups, enabling new opportunities for post&#8208;synthetic modification. Several 3d metals are demonstrated to bind to the backbone, opening the door to the use of nanothreads in advanced applications.







Abstract
Compared with conventional, solution&#8208;phase approaches, solid&#8208;state reaction methods can provide unique access to novel synthetic targets. Nanothreads&#8212;one&#8208;dimensional diamondoid polymers formed through the compression of small molecules&#8212;represent a new class of materials produced via solid&#8208;state reactions, however, the formation of chemically homogeneous products with targeted functionalization represents a persistent challenge. Through careful consideration of molecular precursor stacking geometry and functionalization, we report here the scalable synthesis of chemically homogeneous, functionalized nanothreads through the solid&#8208;state polymerization of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting product possesses high&#8208;density, pendant carboxyl functionalization along both sides of the backbone, enabling new opportunities for the post&#8208;synthetic processing and chemical modification of nanothread materials applicable to a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers through Enantioselective Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient enantioselective desymmetrization protocol is disclosed for the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers by using a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic aromatic amination. This method features broad substrate scope, high yields and high enantioselectivity. The facile derivatization of various products into a series of structurally novel azaarene&#8208;containing diaryl ether atropisomers was also demonstrated.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers are a type of unique atropisomers bearing two potential axes, which have potential applications in a variety of research fields. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of these diaryl ether atropisomers is largely underexplored when compared to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of biaryl or other types of atropisomers. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis of diaryl ether atropisomers through an organocatalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization protocol. The chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric electrophilic aromatic aminations of the symmetrical 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine type substrates afforded a series of diaryl ether atropisomers in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The facile construction of heterocycles by the utilizations of the 1,2&#8208;benzenediamine moiety in the products provided access to a variety of structurally diverse and novel azaarene&#8208;containing diaryl ether atropisomers.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made PdnL2n Metal&#8208;Organic Cages through Covalent Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two PdnL2n (n=2, 12) type metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) decorated with anthracene groups have been successfully functionalized by a covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) approach. This has led to the modified MOCs having new functions compared to the parent MOCs (e.g., concentration&#8208;dependent chirality, aggregation&#8208;induced emission, and chirality&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence).







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is an effective approach for the tailored functionalization of metal&#8208;organic architectures, but its generalizability remains challenging. Herein we report a general covalent PSM strategy to functionalize PdnL2n metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs, n=2, 12) through an efficient Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition between peripheral anthracene substituents and various functional motifs bearing a maleimide group. As expected, the solubility of functionalized Pd12L24 in common solvents can be greatly improved. Interestingly, concentration&#8208;dependent circular dichroism and aggregation&#8208;induced emission are achieved with chiral binaphthol (BINOL)&#8208; and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;modified Pd12L24, respectively. Furthermore, Pd12L24 can be introduced with two different functional groups (e.g., chiral BINOL and achiral pyrene) through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step PSM route to obtain chirality&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence. Moreover, similar results are readily observed with a smaller Pd2L4 system.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission in Layered Silver&#8208;Bismuth Double Perovskites</title>

         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;driven self&#8208;trapping exciton transformation from dark to bright state was achieved in low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites, revealing the physicochemical mechanism of pressure&#8208;induced emission.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) associated with self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs) in low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites has attracted great attention for better materials&#8208;by&#8208;design. Here, using 2D layered double perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3+)4AgBiBr8 as a model system, we advance a fundamental physicochemical mechanism of the PIE from the perspective of carrier dynamics and excited&#8208;state behaviors of local lattice distortion. We observed a pressure&#8208;driven STE transformation from dark to bright states, corresponding a strong broadband Stokes&#8208;shifted emission. Further theoretical analysis demonstrated that the suppressed lattice distortion and enhanced electronic dimensionality in the excited&#8208;state play an important role in the formation of stabilized bright STEs, which could manipulate the self&#8208;trapping energy and lattice deformation energy to form an energy barrier between the potential energy curves of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state, and enhance the electron&#8208;hole orbital overlap, respectively.

         <title>Electrophilically Trapping Water for Preventing Polymerization of Cyclic Ether Towards Low&#8208;Temperature Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) initiated by protons is inhibited by eliminating the trace water in the electrolyte through a water scavenger, which ensures promising low&#8208;temperature performances for LiCoO2 cathode. These findings demonstrate the high feasibility of water scavenger for unexplored design of cyclic ether based low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.







Abstract
Cyclic ether, such as 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), are promising solvent for low&#8208;temperature electrolytes because of the low freezing point. Their use in electrolytes, however, is severely limited since it easily polymerizes in the presence of lithium inorganic salts. The trace water plays a key role via providing the source (proton) for chain initiation, which has, unfortunately, been neglected in most cases. In this work, we present an electrophile, trimethylsilyl isocyanate (Si&#8722;NCO), as the water scavenger, which eliminates moisture by a nucleophilic addition reaction. Si&#8722;NCO allows DOL to maintain liquid over a wide temperature range even in high&#8208;concentration electrolyte. Electrolyte with Si&#8722;NCO additive shows promising low&#8208;temperature performance. Our finding expands the use of cyclic ether solvents in the presence of inorganic salts and highlights a large space for unexplored design of water scavenger with electrophilic feature for low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Biased Borate Esterification during Nucleoside Phosphorylase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions: Apparent Equilibrium Shifts and Kinetic Implications
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biased esterification of nucleosides with borate preferentially removes those reactants from biocatalytic equilibrium systems, with the resulting cyclic borate esters acting as reversible enzyme inhibitors. This effect can be used to manipulate glycosylation equilibria and facilitate biocatalytic access to nucleoside analogues.







Abstract
Biocatalytic nucleoside (trans&#8208;)glycosylations catalyzed by nucleoside phosphorylases have evolved into a practical and convenient approach to the preparation of modified nucleosides, which are important pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various cancers and viral infections. However, the obtained yields in these reactions are generally determined exclusively by the innate thermodynamic properties of the nucleosides involved, hampering the biocatalytic access to many sought&#8208;after target nucleosides. We herein report an additional means for reaction engineering of these systems. We show how apparent equilibrium shifts in phosphorolysis and glycosylation reactions can be effected through entropically driven, biased esterification of nucleosides and ribosyl phosphates with inorganic borate. Our multifaceted analysis further describes the kinetic implications of this in situ reactant esterification for a model phosphorylase.

         <title>Orthogonal Trichromatic Upconversion with High Color Purity in Core&#8208;Shell Nanoparticles for a Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current upconversion&#8208;based display systems generally require excitation pulse modulation or multiple near&#8208;infrared pumping for full&#8208;color tuning, which may cause deleterious effects associated with complex procedure and low color purity. To this end, we present a dual&#8208;channel pump scheme to fine&#8208;control emission in the full color gamut from core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured upconversion nanoparticles.







Abstract
Materials with tunable emission colors has attracted increasing interest in both fundamental research and applications. As a key member of light&#8208;emitting materials family, lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been intensively demonstrated to emit light in any color upon near&#8208;infrared excitation. However, realizing the trichromatic emission in UCNPs with a fixed composition remains a great challenge. Here, without excitation pulsed modulation and three different near&#8208;infrared pumping, we report an experimental design to fine&#8208;control emission in the full color gamut from core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured UCNPs by manipulating the energy migration through dual&#8208;channel pump scheme. We also demonstrate their potential application in full&#8208;color display. These findings may benefit the future development of convenient and versatile optical methos for multicolor tuning and open up the possibility of constructing full&#8208;color volumetric display systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Engineering Photosynthetic Microbial Consortia for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li et&#8197;al. recently developed a highly compatible phototrophic community integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. By a simple alteration of the sucrose utilization module, four distinct products could be synthesized directly from channelling CO2 into various chemicals, thus enabling a carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis.







Abstract
Microbial consortia consisting of phototrophs and heterotrophs have raised extensive attention due to their potential in sustainable biotechnology. The challenge remains in the selection of appropriate partners since most heterotrophic microorganisms cannot naturally use the intermediate carbohydrates secreted by autotrophic partners. In a recent study, the Ni Lab has developed a highly compatible autotrophic&#8208;heterotrophic symbiotic system comprising Synechococcus elongatus and Vibrio natriegens. V.&#8197;natriegens (the sucrose utilization module) shows a high degree of nutritional complementarity and culturing compatibility with the engineered S. elongatus (the CO2 sequestration module). The combination of both species channels CO2 into various valuable chemicals, enabling carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis.

         <title>Tailorable and Biocompatible Supramolecular&#8208;Based Hydrogels Featuring two Dynamic Covalent Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report functionalized peptides that can participate in disulfide and acyl&#8208;hydrazone chemistry. DCLs of such molecules yield self&#8208;assembling fibres. We incorporated cell adhesion&#8208;promoting sequences into the scaffold that can undergo hydrogelation to obtain materials that present biologically relevant ligands. The importance of this work lies in the methodology for fabricating tailor&#8208;made materials through a modular approach.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has proven to be a valuable tool in creating fascinating molecules, structures, and emergent properties in fully synthetic systems. Here we report a system that uses two dynamic covalent bonds in tandem, namely disulfides and hydrazones, for the formation of hydrogels containing biologically relevant ligands. The reversibility of disulfide bonds allows fiber formation upon oxidation of dithiol&#8208;peptide building block, while the reaction between NH&#8722;NH2 functionalized C&#8208;terminus and aldehyde cross&#8208;linkers results in a gel. The same bond&#8208;forming reaction was exploited for the &#8220;decoration&#8221; of the supramolecular assemblies by cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;promoting sequences (RGD and LDV). Fast triggered gelation, cytocompatibility and ability to &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; chemically customize fibrillar scaffold offer potential for applying these systems as a bioactive platform for cell culture and tissue engineering.

The importance of this work lies in the methodology for fabricating tailor-made materials through a modular approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has proven to be a valuable tool in creating fascinating molecules, structures, and emergent properties in fully synthetic systems. Here we report a system that uses two dynamic covalent bonds in tandem, namely disulfides and hydrazones, for the formation of hydrogels containing biologically relevant ligands. The reversibility of disulfide bonds allows fiber formation upon oxidation of dithiol-peptide building block, while the reaction between NH&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functionalized C-terminus and aldehyde cross-linkers results in a gel. The same bond-forming reaction was exploited for the &#8220;decoration&#8221; of the supramolecular assemblies by cell-adhesion-promoting sequences (RGD and LDV). Fast triggered gelation, cytocompatibility and ability to &#8220;on-demand&#8221; chemically customize fibrillar scaffold offer potential for applying these systems as a bioactive platform for cell culture and tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2 Aggregation on Monoethanolamine: Observations from Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How does CO2 interact with an alkanolamine in the gas phase? Using rotational spectroscopy, non&#8208;reactive complexes monoethanolamine&#8208;(CO2)n (where n=1&#8211;4) were characterized. It was discovered that CO2 has a binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. This is in sharp contrast to the general results observed in the solution phase.







Abstract
The initial stages of the gas&#8208;phase nucleation between CO2 and monoethanolamine were investigated via broadband rotational spectroscopy with the aid of extensive theoretical structure sampling. Sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;scale aggregation patterns of monoethanolamine&#8208;(CO2)n, n=1&#8211;4, were identified. An interesting competition between the monoethanolamine intramolecular hydrogen bond and the intermolecular interactions between monoethanolamine and CO2 upon cluster growth was discovered, revealing an intriguing CO2 binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. These findings are in sharp contrast to the general results for aqueous solutions. In the quinary complex, a cap&#8208;like CO2 tetramer was observed cooperatively surrounding the monoethanolamine. As the cluster approaches the critical size of new particle formation, the contribution of CO2 self&#8208;assembly to the overall stability increases.

         <title>The Directional Crystallization Process of Poly (triazine imide) Single Crystals in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the molecular conjugation and directional precipitation processes of poly (triazine imide) single crystals in molten salts from a mesoscopic to a nanoscale. Upon this growth mechanism, a controllable regulation of the dispersity of PTI crystals was achieved towards enhanced photocatalytic performance by manipulating the PTI/salt crystallization fronts.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) photocatalysts prepared via molten salt methods emerge as promising polymer semiconductors with one&#8208;step excitation capacity of overall water splitting. Unveiling the molecular conjugation, nucleation, and crystallization processes of PTI crystals is crucial for their controllable structure design. Herein, microscopy characterization was conducted at the PTI crystallization front from meso to nano scales. The heptazine&#8208;based precursor was found to depolymerize to triazine monomers within molten salts and KCl cubes precipitate as the leading cores that guide the directional stacking of PTI molecular units to form aggregated crystals. Upon this discovery, PTI crystals with improved dispersibility and enhanced photocatalytic performance were obtained by tailoring the crystallization fronts. This study advances insights into the directional assembling of PTI monomers on salt templates, placing a theoretical foundation for the ordered condensation of polymer crystals.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy NASICON&#8208;Type Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3 Cathode Material with Reversible 3.2&#8208;Electron Redox Reaction for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3, can realize a reversible 3.2&#8208;electron redox reaction with five redox couples V5+/4+, Mn4+/3+, Mn3+/2+, V4+/3+, and Ti4+/3+, enabling a high discharge capacity and an ultrahigh energy density. In addition, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the highly reversible structural evolution of Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3 with separate solid&#8208;solution and two&#8208;phase reaction during sodiation/de&#8208;sodiation.







Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structured cathode materials with robust structural stability and large Na+ diffusion channels have aroused great interest in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, most of NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials exhibit redox reaction of no more than three electrons per formula, which strictly limits capacity and energy density. Herein, a series of NASICON&#8208;type Na3+xMnTi1&#8722;xVx(PO4)3 cathode materials are designed, which demonstrate not only a multi&#8208;electron reaction but also high voltage platform. With five redox couples from V5+/4+ (&#8776;4.1&#8197;V), Mn4+/3+ (&#8776;4.0&#8197;V), Mn3+/2+ (&#8776;3.6&#8197;V), V4+/3+ (&#8776;3.4&#8197;V), and Ti4+/3+ (&#8776;2.1&#8197;V), the optimized material, Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3, realizes a reversible 3.2&#8208;electron redox reaction, enabling a high discharge capacity (172.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an ultrahigh energy density (527.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). This work sheds light on the rational construction of NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials with multi&#8208;electron redox reaction for high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from Achiral Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) is generally produced in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on special CP luminescent (CPL) materials, while common achiral luminescent materials are rarely considered to be capable of direct producing CP&#8208;EL. Herein, near ultraviolet CPL materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields and good CPL dissymmetry factors are developed, which can induce blue to red CPL for various achiral luminescent materials. Strong near ultraviolet CP&#8208;EL with the best external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 9.0% and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved by using them as emitters for CP&#8208;OLEDs. By adopting them as hosts or sensitizers, commercially available yellow&#8208;orange achiral phosphorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF materials can generate intense CP&#8208;EL, with high dissymmetry factors and outstanding &#951;exts (30.8%), demonstrating a simple and universal avenue towards efficient CP&#8208;EL.</dc:description>

By adopting them as hosts or sensitizers, commercially available yellow-orange achiral phosphorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and multi-resonance (MR) TADF materials can generate intense CP-EL, with high dissymmetry factors and outstanding &#951;exts (30.8%), demonstrating a simple and universal avenue towards efficient CP-EL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fucose Migration Pathways Identified Using Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fucose is a ubiquitous monosaccharide associated to major classes of glycans. A main obstacle to the sequencing of fucosylated glycans is the migration of fucose, which leads to misinterpretations in mass spectrometry analysis. Here, using ion vibrational spectroscopy, we resolve the structure of fucosylated fragments of Lewis and blood group H antigen trisaccharides and we unveil the position and linkage of the fucose after migration. Our findings demonstrate that the structure of fragment ions resulting from fucose migration can be characterized. Additionally, we report a new type of fucose migration, which does not feature any change of mass and therefore had not been previously reported: it consists of a local migration where the fucose changes its position remaining on the initial residue. Our approach allows the characterization of glycans, an essential step to interpret glycomics data, as well as to understand underlying processes at play in mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Shedding UV&#8208;Light on Mechanochemistry: The Regioselective Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Synthesis of Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical reactors inherently suffer from the low penetration depth of light and therefore rely on high dilutions to enable chemical reactions. Here we present the first method of UV (ultraviolet) photochemistry in the complete absence of bulk solvents in a ball mill. Triphenylene was synthesized via two routes, the Mallory reaction and the cyclodehydrochlorination (CDHC), resulting in yields of 81 and 92&#160;%, respectively. The reaction was successfully scaled up to the gram scale and the robustness of the method was demonstrated for several different substrates. Finally, the regioselective assembly of nanographenes by mechanochemistry was demonstrated for larger systems. Thus, the mechanochemical approach presented here provides a powerful new tool for the atomically precise construction of nanographenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Anticooperative Supramolecular Oligomerization Mediated by V&#8208;Shaped Monomer Design and Unconventional Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>After more than three decades of extensive investigations in supramolecular polymers, strategies for self&#8208;limiting growth still remain challenging. Herein, we exploit a new V&#8208;shaped monomer design to achieve anti&#8208;cooperatively formed oligomers with superior robustness and high luminescence. In toluene, the monomer&#8208;oligomer equilibrium is shifted to the monomer side, enabling the elucidation of the molecular packing modes and the resulting (weak) anticooperativity. Steric effects associated with an antiparallel staircase dye organization are proposed to outcompete aromatic and unconventional B&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;N/C interactions, restricting the growth at the stage of oligomers. In methylcyclohexane (MCH), the packing modes and the anticooperativity are preserved; however, pronounced solvophobic and chain enwrapping effects lead to thermally ultrastable oligomers. Our results shed light on understanding anticooperative effects and restricted growth in self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, TLD1433 a Ru (II) complex, in human clinical trial in photodynamic therapy (PDT) serves as the benchmark to establish protocols for studying the excited&#8208;state dynamics of photosensitizers (PSs) in cellulo, in the local environment provided by human cancer cells. Very little is known about the excited&#8208;state properties of any PS in live cells, and for TLD1433, it is terra incognita. This contribution targets a general problem in phototherapy, which is how to interrogate the light&#8208;triggered, function&#8208;determining processes of the PSs in the relevant biological environment, and establishes methodological advances to study the ultrafast photoinduced processes in TLD1433 when taken up by MCF7 cells. We generalize the methodological developments and results in terms of molecular physics by applying them to TLD1433&#8217;s analogue TLD1633, making this study a benchmark to investigate the excited&#8208;state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in complex biological environment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of deactivation mechanism for near infrared (NIR) emissive organic molecules has been a key issue in chemistry, material science and molecular biology. In this study, based on transient absorption spectroscopy and transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the aggregated Pt(II) complex 4H (efficient NIR emitter) exhibits collective out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with a frequency of 32 cm&#8722;1 (0.96 THz) at the excited states. Importantly, similar THz characteristics were also observed in analogous Pt(II) complexes with prominent NIR emission efficiency. The conservation of THz motions enables excited&#8208;state deactivation to proceed along low&#8208;frequency vibrational coordinates, contributing to the suppression of nonradiative decay and remarkable NIR emission. These novel results highlight the significance of excited&#8208;state vibrations in nonradiative processes, which serve as a benchmark for improving device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Capsule Catalysis Enables the Exploration of Terpenoid Chemical Space Untapped by Nature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical space of terpene natural products can be increased dramatically by expanding the highly conserved substrate scope. Such an expansion based on C3&#8208;phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol provided access to novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives.







Abstract
Terpenes represent the largest and the most diverse class of natural compounds. This is remarkable as the whole variety is accessed from just a handful of highly conserved linear precursors. Modification of the cyclization precursors would enable a dramatic expansion of the accessible chemical space. However, natural enzymes do not enable us to tap into this potential, as they do not tolerate larger deviations from the prototypical substrate structure. Herein we report that supramolecular capsule catalysis enables facile access to diverse and novel terpenoid skeletons that formally can be traced back to C3&#8208;phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol. Novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives were accessed efficiently in only four synthetic steps. Importantly, the products obtained carry functional groups that may be readily derivatized further.

Such an expansion based on C3-phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol provided access to novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terpenes represent the largest and the most diverse class of natural compounds. This is remarkable as the whole variety is accessed from just a handful of highly conserved linear precursors. Modification of the cyclization precursors would enable a dramatic expansion of the accessible chemical space. However, natural enzymes do not enable us to tap into this potential, as they do not tolerate larger deviations from the prototypical substrate structure. Herein we report that supramolecular capsule catalysis enables facile access to diverse and novel terpenoid skeletons that formally can be traced back to C3-phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol. Novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives were accessed efficiently in only four synthetic steps. Importantly, the products obtained carry functional groups that may be readily derivatized further.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Quadruple Catenation of Giant Chiral [8+12] Salicylimine Cubes Driven by Weak Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quadruply interlocked catenane has been formed from giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes in a reaction that can be controlled by the reaction solvent. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed hydrogen bonding to be a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments with partially deuterated cages allowed mechanistic insights into the interlocking process.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked structures are fascinating synthetic targets and the topological complexity achieved through catenation offers numerous possibilities for the construction of new molecules with exciting properties. In the structural space of catenated organic cage molecules, only few examples have been realized so far, and control over the catenation process in solution is still barely achieved. Herein, we describe the formation of a quadruply interlocked catenane of giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes. The formation could be controlled by the choice of solvent used in the reaction. The interlocked structure was unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and weak hydrogen bonding was identified as a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments using partially deuterated cages were performed, revealing that the catenane formation occurs through mechanical interlocking of preformed single cages.

         <title>A Physical Organic Approach towards Statistical Modeling of Tetrazole and Azide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;rich heterocycles and organic azides have found extensive use in many sectors of modern chemistry from drug discovery to energetic materials. The prediction and understanding of their energetic properties are thus key to the safe and effective application of these compounds. In this work, we disclose the use of multivariate linear regression modeling for the prediction of the decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity of structurally diverse tetrazoles and organic azides. We report a data&#8208;driven approach for property prediction featuring a collection of quantum mechanical parameters and computational workflows. The statistical models reported herein carry predictive accuracy as well as chemical interpretability. Model validation was successfully accomplished via tetrazole test sets with parameters generated exclusively in silico. Mechanistic analysis of the statistical models indicated distinct divergent pathways of thermal and impact&#8208;initiated decomposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient electrocatalysts with non&#8208;copper metal sites for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) to hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, a stable metal&#8208;organic framework (DMA)4[Sn2(THO)2] (Sn&#8208;THO, THO6&#8722; = triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexakis(olate), DMA = dimethylammonium) with isolated and distorted octahedral SnO62&#8722; active sites is reported as an electrocatalyst for eCO2RR, showing an exceptional performance for eCO2RR to CH4 product rather than the common products formate and CO for reported Sn&#8208;based catalysts. The partial current density of CH4 reaches a high value of 34.5 mA cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported copper&#8208;based and all non&#8208;Cu metal based catalysts. Our experimental and theoretical results revealed that the isolated SnO62&#8722; active site favors the formation of key *OCOH species to produce CH4 and can greatly inhibit the formation of *OCHO and *COOH species to produce *HCOOH and *CO, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for OER and ORR based on a Cobalt(II) Triazole Pyridine Bis&#8208;[Cobalt(III) Corrole] Complex.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As alternative energy sources are inconceivable, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as futuristic energy carrier gains enormous awareness. However, seeking for stable and electrochemically selective H2O2 ORR electrocatalyst is yet a challenge, making the design of &#8211; ideally &#8211; bifunctional catalysts extremely important and outmost of interest. In this study, we explore the application of a trimetallic cobalt(II) triazole pyridine bis&#8208;[cobalt(III) corrole] complex CoIITP[CoIIIC]23 in OER and ORR catalysis due to its remarkable physicochemical properties, fast charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical reversibility, and durability. With nearly 100% selective catalytic activity towards the two&#8208;electron transfer generated H2O2, an ORR onset potential of 0.8 V vs RHE and a cycling stability of 50000 cycles are detected. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10mA cm&#8208;2 of 412 mV, Faraday efficiency 98% for oxygen, an outstanding Tafel slope of 64 mV dec&#8208;1 combined with superior stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Water&#8208;soluble Photocage for Aqueous Cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder Photoclick Chemistry in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporally functionalized hydrogels have exciting applications in tissue engineering, but routes to pattern these materials typically rely upon radical&#8208;based strategies that can be deleterious in biological settings. Herein, the computationally guided design, synthesis, and application of a water&#8208;soluble cyclopentadienone&#8211;norbornadiene (CPD&#8211;NBD) adduct is disclosed as a photocage for radical&#8208;free cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder click chemistry. We show that this scalable CPD&#8211;NBD derivative can be readily incorporated into hydrogel formulations and commercial 3D printing resins, providing hydrogels that can be patterned with dienophile&#8208;bearing species upon 365 nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene. The utility of this aqueous photoclick is demonstrated by the localized conjugation of maleimide dienophiles in both 2D hydrogel films and structurally complex 3D printed parts. Additionally, we demonstrate that the patterning of a maleimide functionalized adhesive peptide directs cellular adhesion to pre&#8208;programmed locations within hydrogels, highlighting the promise of this water&#8208;soluble photocaged cyclopentadiene as an inexpensive, versatile, and radical&#8208;free photoclick strategy to pattern molecules of interest into biocompatible hydrogel systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective 1,2&#8208;Reduction and Regiodivergent Deuteration of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a general strategy for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of chromium&#8208;bound arenes was developed, thus providing rapid access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Selective arene activation via &#960;&#8208;complexation along with the use of mild hydride Ph3SiH can overcome the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds while tolerating various reduction&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Its versatility further enables a regiodivergent deuteration. Using different sequences of (non)deuterated hydride and acid reagents, the deuterated positions as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation can be controlled precisely, which leads to a large and previously inaccessible chemical space for 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene isotopologues. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on intermediate capture and control experiments. The synthetic value of this selective 1,2&#8208;reduction was demonstrated in the formal total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;galanthamine and (&#177;)&#8208;lycoramine.</dc:description>

         <title>Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 and [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] Tunable Direct Band Gap Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile route using a two&#8208;component flux of LiOH/LiCl enables synthesis of new direct band gap semiconductors of the Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 series. Precise control of synthetic variables such as temperature and LiOH/LiCl ratio allows the fine&#8208;tuning of the Li substitution (x). This gives direct correlation between material properties and synthesis parameters, as the band gap increases with increasing x.







Abstract
Synthesizing solids in molten fluxes enables the rapid diffusion of soluble species at temperatures lower than in solid&#8208;state reactions, leading to crystal formation of kinetically stable compounds. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mixed hydroxide and halide fluxes in synthesizing complex Sr/Ag/Se in mixed LiOH/LiCl. We have accessed a series of two&#8208;dimensional Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 layered phases. With increased LiOH/LiCl ratio or reaction temperature, Li partially substituted Ag to form solid solutions of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 with x up to 0.45. In addition, a new type of intergrowth compound [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] was synthesized upon further reaction of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 with SrSe. Both Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 and [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] exhibit a direct band gap, which increases with increasing Li substitution (x). Therefore, the band gap of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 can be precisely tuned via fine&#8208;tuning x that is controlled by only the flux ratio and temperature.

         <title>Peroxodicarbonate as a Green Oxidizer for the Selective Degradation of Kraft Lignin into Vanillin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative conversion of technical Kraft lignin into vanillin is reported in high yields. Through the ex&#8208;cell electrolysis of aqueous carbonate, peroxodicarbonate is produced and serves as a &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation of lignin.







Abstract
Lignin, the world's largest resource of renewable aromatics, with annually roughly 50 million tons of accruing technical lignin, mainly Kraft lignin, is highly underdeveloped regarding the production of monoaromatics. We demonstrate the oxidative depolymerization of Kraft lignin at 180&#8201;&#176;C to produce vanillin 1 in yields up to 6.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and 92&#8201;% referred to the maximum yield gained from the quantification reaction utilizing nitrobenzene. Using peroxodicarbonate (C2O62&#8722;) as &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation, toxic and/or harmful reagents are prevented. Also, the formed waste can serve as makeup chemical in the pulping process. Na2C2O6 is synthesized in an ex&#8208;cell electrolysis of aqueous Na2CO3 at BDD anodes, achieving a yield of Na2C2O6 with 41&#8201;%. At least, the oxidation and degradation of Kraft lignin is analysis via UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Stable Crystalline Nanohoop Radical and Its Self&#8208;Association Promoted by van der Waals Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable nanohoop radical combining an olympicenyl radical and cycloparaphenylene structures has been synthesized. Unlike other olympicenyl radicals that favor &#960;&#8208;dimerization, this nanohoop radical dimerizes and aggregates by virtue of van der Waals interaction in the solid state.







Abstract
A stable nanohoop radical (OR3) combining the structures of cycloparaphenylene and an olympicenyl radical is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline state. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals that OR3 forms a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer that further aggregates into a one&#8208;dimensional chain in the solid state. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR and concentration&#8208;dependent absorption measurements indicate that the &#960;&#8208;dimer is not formed in solution. An energy decomposition analysis indicates that van der Waals interactions are the driving force for the self&#8208;association process, in contrast with other olympicenyl derivatives that favor &#960;&#8208;dimerization. The physical properties in solution phase have been studied, and the stable cationic species obtained by one&#8208;electron chemical oxidation. This study offers a new molecular design to modulate the self&#8208;association of organic radicals for overcoming the spin&#8208;Peierls transition, and to prepare novel nanohoop compounds with spin&#8208;related properties.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction by a 2e&#8722; pathway has been achieved using two one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The imine linkages led to higher activity and selectivity than two&#8208;dimensional COFs, without the need to introduce other heteroatoms.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are often employed for electrocatalytic systems because of their structural diversity. However, the efficiency of atom utilization is still in need of improvement, because the catalytic centers are located in the basal layers and it is difficult for the electrolytes to access them. Herein, we demonstrate the use of 1D COFs for the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The use of different four&#8208;connectivity blocks resulted in the prepared 1D COFs displaying good crystallinity, high surface areas, and excellent chemical stability. The more exposed catalytic sites resulted in the 1D COFs showing large electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8&#8208;fold of that of a control 2D COF, and thus enabled catalysis of the ORR with a higher H2O2 selectivity of 85.8&#8201;% and activity, with a TOF value of 0.051&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;V, than a 2D COF (72.9&#8201;% and 0.032&#8197;s&#8722;1). This work paves the way for the development of COFs with low dimensions for electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction by a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway has been achieved using two one-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The imine linkages led to higher activity and selectivity than two-dimensional COFs, without the need to introduce other heteroatoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are often employed for electrocatalytic systems because of their structural diversity. However, the efficiency of atom utilization is still in need of improvement, because the catalytic centers are located in the basal layers and it is difficult for the electrolytes to access them. Herein, we demonstrate the use of 1D COFs for the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The use of different four-connectivity blocks resulted in the prepared 1D COFs displaying good crystallinity, high surface areas, and excellent chemical stability. The more exposed catalytic sites resulted in the 1D COFs showing large electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8-fold of that of a control 2D COF, and thus enabled catalysis of the ORR with a higher H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 85.8&#8201;% and activity, with a TOF value of 0.051&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;V, than a 2D COF (72.9&#8201;% and 0.032&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work paves the way for the development of COFs with low dimensions for electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiplex Identification of Post&#8208;Translational Modifications at Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care by Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Hydrogel Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiplex detection of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), especially at point&#8208;of&#8208;care, is of great significance in cancer diagnosis. Herein, we report a machine learning&#8208;assisted photonic crystal hydrogel (PCH) sensor for multiplex detection of PTMs. With closely&#8208;related PCH sensors microfabricated on a single chip, our design achieved not only rapid screening of PTMs at specific protein sites by using only naked eyes/cellphone, but also the feasibility of real&#8208;time monitoring of phosphorylation reactions. By taking advantage of multiplex sensor chips and a neural network algorithm, accurate prediction of PTMs by both their types and concentrations was enabled. This approach was ultimately used to detect and differentiate up/down regulation of different phosphorylation sites within the same protein in live mammalian cells. Our developed method thus holds potential for POC identification of various PTMs in early&#8208;stage diagnosis of protein&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Translocation&#8208;Mediated Signal Amplification for Spatially Selective Aptasensing of ATP in Inflammatory Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically triggerable, aptamer&#8208;based signal amplification approach is developed to achieve inflammatory cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging in vitro and in vivo. The system relies on enzyme translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm in inflammatory cells, which activate an aptasensor for ATP recognition and further initiate cascade reactions for signal amplification.







Abstract
Amplified ATP imaging in inflammatory cells is highly desirable. However, the spatial selectivity of current amplification methods is limited, that is, signal amplification is performed systemically and not in a disease site&#8208;specific manner. Here we present a versatile strategy, termed enzymatically triggerable, aptamer&#8208;based signal amplification (ETA&#8208;SA), that enables inflammatory cell&#8208;specific imaging of ATP through spatially&#8208;resolved signal amplification. The ETA&#8208;SA leverages a translocated enzyme in inflammatory cells to activate DNA aptamer probes and further drive cascade reactions through the consumption of hairpin fuels, which, however, exerts no ATP response activity in normal cells, leading to a significantly improved sensitivity and spatial specificity for the inflammation&#8208;specific ATP imaging in vivo. Benefiting from the improved spatial selectivity, enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios were achieved for ATP imaging during acute hepatitis.

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Chiral Z&#8208;Allylamides by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Sequential Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric sequential hydrogenations of conjugated enynes have been developed. The precise synthesis of chiral Z&#8208;allylamides has been realized in high activity (up to 1000&#8197;S/C) and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanism experiment and theoretical calculation supported a reasonable cationic CoI/CoIII redox catalytic cycle, and explained the difference in reactivity between Ph&#8208;BPE&#8208;Co and QuinoxP*&#8208;Co.







Abstract
Asymmetric sequential hydrogenations of conjugated enynes have been developed using a Ph&#8208;BPE&#8208;CoI catalyst for the precise synthesis of chiral Z&#8208;allylamides in high activity (up to 1000 substrate/catalyst (S/C)) and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee)). Mechanism experiments and theoretical calculations support a cationic CoI/CoIII redox catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity difference between cobalt complexes of Ph&#8208;BPE and QuinoxP* was explained by the process decomposition of rate&#8208;determining step in the second hydrogenation.

         <title>Fluorescent Flippers: Small&#8208;Molecule Probes to Image Membrane Tension in Living Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of fluorescent flippers as membrane tension probes is described in the context of the general challenge to create chemistry tools to image physical forces in living systems.







Abstract
Flipper probes have been introduced as small molecule fluorophores to image physical forces, that is, membrane tension in living systems. Their emergence over one decade is described, from evolution in design and synthesis to spectroscopic properties. Responsiveness to physical compression in equilibrium at the ground state is identified as the ideal origin of mechanosensitivity to image membrane tension in living cells. A rich collection of flippers is described to deliver and release in any subcellular membrane of interest in a leaflet&#8208;specific manner. Chalcogen&#8208;bonding cascade switching and dynamic covalent flippers are developed for super&#8208;resolution imaging and dual&#8208;sensing of membrane compression and hydration. Availability and broad use in the community validate flipper probes as a fine example of the power of translational supramolecular chemistry, moving from fundamental principles to success on the market.

         <title>Elucidation of the Alternating Copolymerization Mechanism of Epoxides or Aziridines with Cyclic Anhydrides in the Presence of Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chain&#8208;end coordination processes have been reported to promote highly active and selective ROCOP. The complex behavior of salts in the copolymerizations have led to the elucidation of the alternating copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Organic halide salts in combination with metal or organic compound are the most common and essential catalysts in ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP). However, the role of organic halide salts was neglected. Here, we have uncovered the complex behavior of organic halides in ROCOP of epoxides or aziridine with cyclic anhydride. Coordination of the chain&#8208;ends to cations, electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, leaving ability of halide atoms, chain&#8208;end basicity/nucleophilicity, and terminal steric hindrance cause three types of side reactions: single&#8208;site transesterification, substitution, and elimination. Understanding the complex functions of organic halide salts in ROCOP led us to develop highly active and selective aminocyclopropenium chlorides as catalysts/initiators. Adjustable H&#8208;bonding interactions of aminocyclopropenium with propagating anions and epoxides create chain&#8208;end coordination process that generate highly reactive carboxylate and highly selective alkoxide chain&#8208;ends.

A LiF&#8208;rich SEI studied by in situ XPS and time&#8208;dependent EIS protects the Li metal anode against the dendrite growth. The stable interfaces in the PEGDME/LPSCl composite SE enable homogeneous lithium plating/stripping for both Li symmetric cells and Li/LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2 cells.







Abstract
Organic/inorganic interfaces greatly affect Li+ transport in composite solid electrolytes (SEs), while SE/electrode interfacial stability plays a critical role in the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). However, incomplete understanding of interfacial (in)stability hinders the practical application of composite SEs in SSBs. Herein, chemical degradation between Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is revealed. The high polarity of PEG changes the electronic state and structural bonding of the PS43&#8722; tetrahedra, thus triggering a series of side reactions. A substituted terminal group of PEG not only stabilizes the inner interfaces but also extends the electrochemical window of the composite SE. Moreover, a LiF&#8208;rich layer can effectively prevent side reactions at the Li/SE interface. The results provide insights into the chemical stability of polymer/sulfide composites and demonstrate an interface design to achieve dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Frustration in Super&#8208;Ionic Conductors Unraveled by the Density of Atomistic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of atomistic states (DOAS) quantitatively characterizes the onset and degree of disordering, reveals the energetics of local disorder, and elucidates how the frustration enhances diffusion, through the broadening and overlapping of the energy levels of atomistic states. The DOAS is generally applicable analytics for unraveling fundamental mechanisms in complex atomistic systems and for guiding material design.







Abstract
The frustration in super&#8208;ionic conductors enables their exceptionally high ionic conductivities, which are desired for many technological applications including batteries and fuel cells. A key challenge in the study of frustration is the difficulties in analyzing a large number of disordered atomistic configurations. Using lithium super&#8208;ionic conductors as model systems, we propose and demonstrate the density of atomistic states (DOAS) analytics to quantitatively characterize the onset and degree of disordering, reveal the energetics of local disorder, and elucidate how the frustration enhances diffusion through the broadening and overlapping of the energy levels of atomistic states. Furthermore, material design strategies aided by the DOAS are devised and demonstrated for new super&#8208;ionic conductors. The DOAS is generally applicable analytics for unraveling fundamental mechanisms in complex atomistic systems and guiding material design.

         <title>Programming Super DNA&#8208;Enzyme Molecules for On&#8208;Demand Enzyme Activity Modulation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme cascades in the free state are random and uncontrolled. We constructed a super DNA&#8208;enzymes molecule (SDEM) to make programmable and controlled cascades by toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement. The SDEMs can be made sensitive to different substrates on demand via an entropically driven catalytic assembly.







Abstract
Dynamic interactions of enzymes, including programmable configuration and cycling of enzymes, play important roles in the regulation of cellular metabolism. Here, we constructed a super DNA&#8208;enzymes molecule (SDEM) that comprises at least two cascade enzymes and multiple linked DNA strands to control and detect metabolism. We found that the programmable SDEM, which comprises glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), has a 20&#8208;fold lower detection limit and a 1.6&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than free enzymes. An SDEM can be assembled and disassembled using a hairpin structure and a displacement DNA strand to complete multiple cycles. An entropically driven catalytic assembly (catassembly) enables different SDEMs to switch from an SDEM with GOx and HRP cascades to an SDEM with sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and HRP cascades in over six orders of magnitude less time than without the catassembly to detect different metabolisms (GO and sarcosine) on demand.

         <title>Akaike's Information Criterion for Stoichiometry Inference of Supramolecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An information&#8208;theoretic approach of Akaike's information criterion is introduced to infer the stoichiometry of host&#8211;guest complexes with weight of evidence for ranking. AIC may provide a versatile and superior method in place of the Job plot.







Abstract
&#8220;How do we decide the stoichiometry of host&#8211;guest complexes?&#8221; This question has long been answered by the Job plot since its first report in 1928. However, as the Job plot was claimed to be misleading in 2016, the question became an open question again and called for renewed investigations. An information&#8208;theoretic approach, called Akaike's information criterion, is introduced in this study to select the best model of host&#8211;guest complexes, which can rank the models with weight of evidence. A few test cases with unique cylindrical hosts were examined to demonstrate the applicability of the information&#8208;theoretic method. Consequently, reasonable views over the thermodynamic behaviors of dumbbell&#8208;and&#8208;cylinder complexes were obtained. Akaike's information criterion can be a useful and superior alternative to statistical null hypothesis testing, which was proposed as a remedy in place of the Job plot.

         <title>Microwave Synthesis of Pt Clusters on Black TiO2 with Abundant Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Acidic Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black TiO2 supported sub&#8208;nanometer Pt clusters (Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV) is designed through solvent&#8208;free microwave and following electroless approach. Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance with 18&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial Pt/C.







Abstract
Oxygen vacancies&#8208;enriched black TiO2 is one promising support for enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, oxygen vacancies enriched black TiO2 supported sub&#8208;nanometer Pt clusters (Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV) with metal support interactions is designed through solvent&#8208;free microwave and following low&#8208;temperature electroless approach for the first time. High&#8208;temperature and strong reductants are not required and then can avoid the aggregation of decorated Pt species. Experimental and theoretical calculation verify that the created oxygen vacancies and Pt clusters exhibit synergistic effects for optimizing the reaction kinetics. Based on it, Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance with 18&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 coupled with small Tafel slope of 12&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work provides quick synthetic strategy for preparing black titanium dioxide based nanomaterials.

         <title>Enzymatic Electrosynthesis of Glycine from CO2 and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic electrocatalytic system was developed for the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 for glycine synthesis. This system was inspired by the reductive glycine pathway in vivo and involves an in vitro multienzymatic cascade reaction. It shows the potential of enzymatic CO2 electroreduction for the synthesis of nitrogenous value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
Enzymatic electrosynthesis has gained more and more interest as an emerging green synthesis platform, particularly for the fixation of CO2. However, the simultaneous utilization of CO2 and a nitrogenous molecule for the enzymatic electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added products has never been reported. In this study, we constructed an in vitro multienzymatic cascade based on the reductive glycine pathway and demonstrated an enzymatic electrocatalytic system that allowed the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize glycine. Through effective coupling and the optimization of electrochemical cofactor regeneration and the multienzymatic cascade reaction, 0.81&#8197;mM glycine was yielded with a highest reaction rate of 8.69&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and faradaic efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. These results imply a promising alternative for enzymatic CO2 electroreduction and expand its products to nitrogenous chemicals.

&lt;p&gt;An enzymatic electrocatalytic system was developed for the simultaneous conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for glycine synthesis. This system was inspired by the reductive glycine pathway in vivo and involves an in vitro multienzymatic cascade reaction. It shows the potential of enzymatic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction for the synthesis of nitrogenous value-added chemicals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic electrosynthesis has gained more and more interest as an emerging green synthesis platform, particularly for the fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the simultaneous utilization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a nitrogenous molecule for the enzymatic electrosynthesis of value-added products has never been reported. In this study, we constructed an in vitro multienzymatic cascade based on the reductive glycine pathway and demonstrated an enzymatic electrocatalytic system that allowed the simultaneous conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize glycine. Through effective coupling and the optimization of electrochemical cofactor regeneration and the multienzymatic cascade reaction, 0.81&#8197;mM glycine was yielded with a highest reaction rate of 8.69&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and faradaic efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. These results imply a promising alternative for enzymatic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction and expand its products to nitrogenous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Binding Microenvironments in Halogen Bonding Polymers for Enhanced Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen&#8208;bonding (XB), redox&#8208;active copolymeric hosts are demonstrated to enhance anion binding and sensing performances with respect to their discrete receptive monomers. Through judicious choice of co&#8208;monomers, the local dielectric environment within the polymeric hosts can be modulated, resulting in up to a 50&#8208;fold improvement in binding constant with a XB polymeric host in response to I&#8722; compared to its monomer.







Abstract
Mimicking Nature's polymeric protein architectures by designing hosts with binding cavities screened from bulk solvent is a promising approach to achieving anion recognition in competitive media. Accomplishing this, however, can be synthetically demanding. Herein we present a synthetically tractable approach, by directly incorporating potent supramolecular anion&#8208;receptive motifs into a polymeric scaffold, tuneable through a judicious selection of the co&#8208;monomer. A comprehensive analysis of anion recognition and sensing is demonstrated with redox&#8208;active, halogen bonding polymeric hosts. Notably, the polymeric hosts consistently outperform their monomeric analogues, with especially large halide binding enhancements of ca. 50&#8208;fold observed in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures. These binding enhancements are rationalised by the generation and presentation of low dielectric constant binding microenvironments from which there is appreciable solvent exclusion.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Benzylamine Derivatives: Synthesis of a Precursor to Levocetirizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deprotonation of N&#8242;&#8208;aryl urea derivatives with a chiral lithium amide base leads to an enantioselective C&#8208;arylation of benzylamines. An unusual stereoretentive substitution reaction followed by N&#8208;deprotection of the urea forms diarylmethylamine derivatives, including a synthetic intermediate en route to the drug levocetirizine.







Abstract
A practical, transition metal&#8208;free method allows the enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamines by asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of benzylamines. Enantioselective lithiation of N&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;isopropyl ureas using a chiral lithium amide base generates a benzyllithium that undergoes an unactivated stereospecific intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamine in the form of its urea derivative, in up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Treatment with acid induces an &#8220;azatropic shift&#8221; with retention of configuration, the product of which may be hydrolysed to the target amine.

         <title>Wide&#8208;coverage and Efficient NIR Emission from Single&#8208;component Nanophosphors through Shaping Multiple Metal&#8208;halide Packages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widest&#8208;coverage single&#8208;component near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (850&#8211;1650&#8197;nm) with the high NIR photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 20.3&#8201;% in Sm3+, Nd3+, Er3+ triple&#8208;doped Cs2K0.5Rb0.5(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 NCs is achieved. The remarkable results are attributed to the improved energy transfer efficiency between host and lanthanide (Ln3+) ions and reduced cation site symmetry of Ln3+ ions due to alkali metal substitution.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;coverage near infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs possess promising potential for practical applications, but little is developed towards the efficient and wide&#8208;coverage NIR phosphors. Here, we report the single&#8208;component lanthanide (Ln3+) ions doped Cs2M(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 (M=alkali metal) nanocrystals (NCs), exhibiting emission from 850 to 1650&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 20.3&#8201;%, which is accomplished by shaping the multiple metal halide octahedra of double perovskite via the simple alkali metal substitution. From Judd&#8208;Ofelt theoretical calculation and spectroscopic investigations, the shaping of metal halide octahedra in Cs2M(In1&#8722;xSbx)Cl6 NCs can break the forbidden of f&#8208;f transition of Ln3+, thus increasing their radiative transition rates and simultaneously boosting the energy transfer efficiency from host to Ln3+. Finally, the wide&#8208;coverage NIR LEDs based on Sm3+, Nd3+, Er3+&#8208;tridoped Cs2K0.5Rb0.5(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 NCs are fabricated and employed in the multiplex gas sensing and night&#8208;vision application.

         <dc:description>
Unlike the known biosynthetic pathways for the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure in bacteria, double&#8208;bond installation by heme&#8208;dependent AspF, unprecedented stereoinversion upon hydroxylation by FeII/2&#8208;OG&#8208;dependent AspE, and subsequent dehydration lead to the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure of brevianamide K in the fungus Aspergillus sp. SK&#8208;28.







Abstract
Natural products with the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine core are widely distributed in nature; however, the biosynthetic mechanism of 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine in fungi remains to be further elucidated. Through heterologous expression and biochemical investigation of an FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxidase (AspE) and a heme&#8208;dependent P450 enzyme (AspF), we report that AspE, AspF and subsequent dehydration account for the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure of brevianamide K from Aspergillus sp. SK&#8208;28, a symbiotic fungus of mangrove plant Kandelia candel. More interestingly, in&#8208;depth investigation of the enzymatic mechanism showed that AspE promotes hydroxylation of brevianamide Q with unprecedented stereoinversion through hydrogen atom abstraction and water nucleophilic attack from the opposite face of the resultant iminium cation intermediate.

         <title>Designing Heteroatom&#8208;Codoped Iron Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Promotional Photoreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of new active sites with beneficial defects in Fe&#8208;MOF MIL&#8208;88B catalysts gives enhanced photoreduction of CO2 to C2H4 under visible light. The modified structure promotes the migration and separation of the photoelectrons to produce the pivotal C&#8722;C coupling intermediate for the generation of C2H4, a result supported by in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis.







Abstract
Rational engineering active sites and vantage defects of catalysts are promising but grand challenging task to enhance photoreduction CO2 to high value&#8208;added C2 products. In this study, we designed an N,S&#8208;codoped Fe&#8208;based MIL&#8208;88B catalyst with well&#8208;defined bipyramidal hexagonal prism morphology via a facile and effective process, which was synthesized by addition of appropriate 1,2&#8208;benzisothiazolin&#8208;3&#8208;one (BIT) and acetic acid to the reaction solution. Under simulated solar irradiation, the designed catalyst exhibits high C2H4 evolution yield of 17.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h, which has been rarely achieved in photocatalytic CO2 reduction process. The synergistic effect of Fe&#8208;N coordinated sites and reasonable defects in the N,S&#8208;codoped photocatalyst can accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers, resulting in high electron density, and this in turn helps to facilitate the formation and dimerization of C&#8722;C coupling intermediates for C2H4 effectively.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Embedded Heterocyclic Narrowband Emitters with Strengthened Molecular Rigidity and Suppressed High&#8208;Frequency Vibronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics are of great interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), however, exploring highly efficient narrowband emitters based on sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics remains challenging. Herein, five emitters with different sulfur valence state and molecular rigidity, namely tP, tCPD, 2tCPD, tPD and tPT, are thoroughly analysed. With restricted twisting of flexible peripheral phenyl by strengthening molecular rigidity, molecular emission spectra can be enormously narrowed. Further, introducing the sulfone group with bending vibration in low&#8208;frequency region that suppresses high&#8208;frequency vibration, sharp narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum of 28 and 25 nm are achieved for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively. Maximum external quantum efficiencies of 22.0% and 27.1% are successfully realized for 2tCPD&#8208; and tPD&#8208;based OLED devices. These results offer a novel design strategy for constructing narrowband emitters by introducing sulfone group into a rigid molecular framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Computer&#8208;aided discovery of potent broad&#8208;spectrum vaccine adjuvants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to vigorously respond to a vaccine. While current adjuvants such as aluminum salts and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions have been used for decades, they do not generate broad and long&#8208;lasting responses in many vaccines. Consequently, more potent adjuvants are needed. Here, using computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning, we discovered 2 new, broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants that can boost vaccine responses. Our library containing 46 toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR)&#8208;targeting agonist ligands were assembled on Au nanoparticles. Comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies showed both leads promoted dendritic cell activation via multiple TLRs and enhanced antigen presentation to T cells. When used together with tumor&#8208;specific antigens to immunize mice against B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and 4T1&#8208;PD1 breast cancer, both adjuvants unleashed strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases. Our results show computer&#8208;aided design and screening can rapidly uncover potent adjuvants for tackling waning immunity in current vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Random Island Nucleation in the Electrochemical Roughening on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many chemical surface systems develop ordered nano&#8208;islands during repeated reaction and restoration. Platinum is used in electrochemical energy applications, like fuel cells and electrolysers, although it is scarce, expensive, and degrades. During oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles, simulating device operation, nucleation and growth of nano&#8208;islands occurs that eventually enhances the dissolution. Preventing nucleation would be the most effective solution. However, little is known about the atomic details of the nucleation; a process almost impossible to observe. Here, we analyze the nuclei&#8208;distance distribution mapping out the underlying atomic mechanism: a rarely observed, non&#8208;random nucleation takes place. Special, preferential nucleation sites that a priori do not exist, develop initially via a precursor and eventually form a semi&#8208;ordered Pt&#8208;oxide structure. This precursor mechanism seems to be general, possibly explaining also the nano&#8208;island formation on other surfaces/reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double&#8208;Walled Tetrahedron with AgI4 Vertices Binds Different Guests in Distinct Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A double&#8208;walled tetrahedral metal&#8208;organic cage assembled in solution from silver(I), 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, halide, and a threefold&#8208;symmetric triamine. The AgI4X clusters at its vertices bring together six naphthyridine&#8208;imine moieties, leading to a structure in which eight tritopic ligands bridge four clusters in an (AgI4X)4L8 arrangement. Four ligands form an inner set of tetrahedron walls that are surrounded by the outer four. The cage has significant interior volume, and was observed to bind anionic guests. The structure also possesses external binding clefts, located at the edges of the cage, which bound small aromatic guests. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well&#8208;defined hierarchy, allowing modulation of the cavity volume. The principles uncovered here may allow for increasingly more sophisticated cages with silver&#8208;cluster vertex architectures, with post&#8208;assembly tuning of the interior cavity volume enabling targeted binding behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Late&#8208;Stage Modifications Enable Downstream Click&#8208;Mediated Fluorescent Tagging of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic prenyltransferases from cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways catalyse the chemoselective and regioselective intramolecular transfer of prenyl/geranyl groups from isoprene donors to an electron&#8208;rich position in these macrocyclic and linear peptides. These enzymes often demonstrate relaxed substrate specificity and are considered useful biocatalysts for structural diversification of peptides. Here, we assess the isoprene donor specificity of the N1&#8208;tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF from anacyclamide A8P pathway, using a library of 22 synthetic alkyl&#8208;pyrophosphate analogues, of which, many display reactive groups that are amenable to additional functionalisation. We further used AcyF to introduce a reactive moiety in a tryptophan&#8208;containing cyclic peptide and subsequently used click chemistry to fluorescently label the enzymatically modified peptide.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aromatic prenyltransferases from cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways catalyse the chemoselective and regioselective intramolecular transfer of prenyl/geranyl groups from isoprene donors to an electron-rich position in these macrocyclic and linear peptides. These enzymes often demonstrate relaxed substrate specificity and are considered useful biocatalysts for structural diversification of peptides. Here, we assess the isoprene donor specificity of the N1-tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF from anacyclamide A8P pathway, using a library of 22 synthetic alkyl-pyrophosphate analogues, of which, many display reactive groups that are amenable to additional functionalisation. We further used AcyF to introduce a reactive moiety in a tryptophan-containing cyclic peptide and subsequently used click chemistry to fluorescently label the enzymatically modified peptide. This chemoenzymatic strategy allows late-stage modification of peptides and is highly useful for many applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans Rearrangement by 1,3,2&#8208;Diazaphospholene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene hydrides (DAP&#8208;H) enable smooth conjugate reduction of polarized double bonds. The transiently formed phosphorus&#8208;enolate provides a potential platform for reductive &#945;&#8208;functionalizations. In this respect, asymmetric C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming processes are synthetically appealing but remain elusive. We report a 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;step cascade reaction of N&#8208;sulfinyl acrylamides comprised of conjugate reduction, [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement and subsequent S&#8208;O bond cleavage. The obtained enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl amides are formed in good yields and excellent enantiospecificity. The stereo&#8208;defined P&#8208;bound N,O&#8208;ketene aminal ensures an excellent transfer of chirality from the sulfur stereocenter to &#945;&#8208;carbon. The transformation operates under mild conditions at ambient temperature. Moreover, DAP&#8208;H is a competent reductant for the cleavage of formed sulfenate ester, eliminating the extra step in traditional Mislow&#8208;Evans processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn Anodes Protected by Intermetallic FeSn2 Layers for Long&#8208;lifespan Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency of 93.8%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With a theoretical capacity of 847 mAh g&#8208;1, Sn has emerged as promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, enormous volume expansion and agglomeration of nano Sn lead to low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Herein, an intermetallic FeSn2 layer is designed via thermal reduction of polymer&#8208;Fe2O3 coated hollow SnO2 spheres to construct a yolk&#8208;shell structured Sn/FeSn2@C. The FeSn2 layer can relieve internal stress, avoid the agglomeration of Sn to accelerate the Na+ transport, and enable fast electronic conduction, which endows quick electrochemical dynamics and long&#8208;term stability. As a result, the Sn/FeSn2@C anode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE=93.8%) and a high reversible capacity of 409 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 after 1500 cycles, corresponding to an 80% capacity retention. In addition, NVP//Sn/FeSn2@C sodium&#8208;ion full cell shows outstanding cycle stability (capacity retaining rate of 89.7% after 200 cycles at 1 C).</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Distance and Reactivity of Coreactants Determine the Sensitivity of Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the study of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) generation by tris(2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and five tertiary amine coreactants. The ECL distance and lifetime of coreactant radical cations were measured by ECL self&#8208;interference spectroscopy. And the reactivity of coreactants was quantitatively evaluated in terms of integrated ECL intensity. By statistical analysis of ECL images of single Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;labeled microbeads, we propose that ECL distance and reactivity of coreactant codetermine the emission intensity and thus the sensitivity of immunoassay. 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2',2''&#8208;nitrilotriethanol (BIS&#8208;TRIS) can well balance ECL distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and enhance the sensitivity by 236% compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) in the bead&#8208;based immunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen. The study brings an insightful understanding of ECL generation in bead&#8208;based immunoassay and a way of maximizing the analytical sensitivity from the aspect of coreactant.</dc:description>

         <title>A LDH Template Triggers the Formation of a Highly Compact MIL&#8208;53 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane for Acid Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly compact metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes offer hope for the ambition to cope with challenging separation scenarios with industrial implications. A continuous layer of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes on an alumina support as a template triggered a chemical self&#8208;conversion to a MIL&#8208;53 membrane, with approximately 8 hexagonal lattices (LDH) traded for 1 orthorhombic lattice (MIL&#8208;53). With the sacrifice of the template, the availability of Al nutrients from the alumina support was dynamically regulated, which resulted in synergy for producing membranes with highly compact architecture. The membrane can realize nearly complete dewatering from formic acid and acetic acid solutions, respectively, and maintain stability in a continuous pervaporation over 200 h. This is the first success in directly applying a pure MOF membrane to such a corrosive chemical environment (lowest pH value of 0.81). The energy consumption is saved by up to 77% when compared with the traditional distillation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Using Low&#8208;Melting Metal Salt Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials constructed from organic linkers and inorganic nodes with myriad potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and drug delivery. A major barrier to the application of MOFs is their poor scalability, as most frameworks are prepared under highly dilute solvothermal conditions using toxic organic solvents. Herein, we demonstrate that combining a range of linkers with low&#8208;melting metal halide (hydrate) salts leads directly to high&#8208;quality MOFs without added solvent. Frameworks prepared these under ionothermal conditions possess porosities comparable to those prepared under traditional solvothermal conditions. In addition, we report the ionothermal syntheses of two frameworks that cannot be prepared directly under solvothermal conditions. Overall, the user&#8208;friendly method reported herein should be broadly applicable to the discovery and synthesis of stable metal&#8208;organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Stoichiometric and Homogenized Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Minimized Performance Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;cation, small band&#8208;gap perovskites via rationally alloying formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) together have been widely employed for blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells with satisfied efficiencies. One of the stringent challenges lies in difficult control of the nucleation and crystallization kinetics of the perovskites with mixed ingredients. Herein, a pre&#8208;seeding strategy by mixing FAPbI3 solution with pre&#8208;synthesized MAPbI3 microcrystals has been developed to smartly decouple the nucleation and crystallization process. As a result, the time window of initialized crystallization has been greatly extended by 3 folds (i.e. from 5 s to 20 s), which enables the formation of uniform and homogeneous alloyed&#8208;FAMA perovskite films with designated stoichiometric ratios. The resultant blade&#8208;coated solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 24.31% accompanied by outstanding reproducibility with more than 87% of the devices showing efficiencies higher than 23%.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt Metathesis: Tetrafluoroborate Anion Rapidly Fluoridates Organoboronic Acids to give Organotrifluoroborates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrafluoroborate anion, considered to be weakly coordinating and relatively inert for organic chemistry applications, readily undergoes salt metasthesis with organoboronic acids to afford the corresponding organotrifluoroborates. Its spontaneous solvolysis in methanol to HF/MeOBF3&#8722; and pH&#8208;dependent aqueous solvolysis as a more general feature, highlight its non&#8208;inertness and reactivity potential for use in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) has long been used as a spectator counter anion. Herein, we report an unprecedented salt metathesis between a variety of BF4&#8722; salts and a series of organoboronic acids yielding the corresponding organotrifluoroborates. We identified conditions for fast and efficient fluoridation (&lt;1&#8197;h) with minimal workup. Fundamentally, this work discloses the proclivity of BF4&#8722; to exchange fluoride atoms with organoboronates, highlighting the lability of BF4&#8722;.

         <title>Probing a Hydrogen&#8208;&#960; Interaction Involving a Trapped Water Molecule in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR at fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100&#8197;kHz) and high static magnetic field (28.2&#8197;T) has been employed in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations to study a trapped water molecule in the cavity of a calix[4]arene lanthanide complex. The study illustrates the high sensitivity of proton NMR chemical&#8208;shift values for non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events.







Abstract
The detection and characterization of trapped water molecules in chemical entities and biomacromolecules remains a challenging task for solid materials. We herein present proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments at 100&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning and at high static magnetic&#8208;field strengths (28.2&#8197;T) enabling the detection of a single water molecule fixed in the calix[4]arene cavity of a lanthanide complex by a combination of three types of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The water proton resonances are detected at a chemical&#8208;shift value close to zero ppm, which we further confirm by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Density Functional Theory calculations pinpoint to the sensitivity of the proton chemical&#8208;shift value for hydrogen&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our study highlights how proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR is turning into the method&#8208;of&#8208;choice in probing weak non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events in chemistry and biology.

         <title>Solvent Induced Conversion of a Self&#8208;Assembled Gyrobifastigium to a Barrel and Encapsulation of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine within the Barrel for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare gyrobifastigium structure was constructed and converted to its isomeric Pd8 tetragonal barrel by simple treatment with water. The water&#8208;soluble barrel was used as a host to encapsulate hydrophobic photosensitizer zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc) for enhanced PDT activity in the aqueous medium under red light irradiation.







Abstract
A rare gyrobifastigium architecture (GB) was constructed by self&#8208;assembly of a tetradentate donor (L) with PdII acceptor in DMSO. The GB was converted to its isomeric tetragonal barrel (MB) upon treatment with water. The hydrophobic cavity of MB has been explored for the encapsulation of zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), which is an excellent photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the poor water&#8208;solubility and aggregation tendency are the main reasons for the suboptimal PDT performance of free ZnPc in the aqueous medium. Effective solubilization of ZnPc in an aqueous medium was achieved by encapsulating it in the cavity of MB. The inclusion complex (ZnPc&#8834;MB) showed enhanced singlet oxygen generation in water. Higher cellular uptake and anticancer activity of the ZnPc&#8834;MB compared to free ZnPc on HeLa cells indicate that encapsulation of ZnPc in an aqueous host is a potential strategy for enhancement of its PDT activity in water.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;Bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles has been established via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition of indole&#8208;based enaminones with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters. This study provides a new strategy for the highly selective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles and shows the successful application of such skeletons in medicinal and synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
This study establishes the first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloadditions of indole&#8208;based enaminones as novel platform molecules with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, where de novo indole&#8208;ring formation is involved. Using this new strategy, various axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles were synthesized in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 87&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee). More importantly, this class of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles exhibited some degree of cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and was derived into axially chiral phosphine ligands with high catalytic activity. This study provides a new strategy for enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles using asymmetric organocatalysis and is the first to realize the applications of such scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids by Manganese Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Primary Alcohols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis of highly demanded &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids via dehydrogenative coupling of two feedstock chemicals, ethylene glycol, and primary alcohols, is reported. An Earth's abundant metal complex catalyzes the reaction with high yields and selectivities. Water and hydrogen gas are produced as the sole byproducts.







Abstract
Herein, we report a straightforward synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid molecules via an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and primary alcohols. A bench&#8208;stable manganese complex catalyzed the reaction, which is scalable, with the product being isolated with high yields and selectivities under mild conditions. The protocol is environmentally benign, producing water and hydrogen gas as the only byproducts. Methanol can also be used as a C1 source for producing the platform molecule lactic acid, with a high turnover of &gt;104. The methodology was also used to functionalize alcohols derived from natural products and fatty acids. Furthermore, it was applied for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;amino acid, &#945;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acid, and several drugs and bioactive molecules, including endogenous metabolites, Danshensu, Enalapril, Lisinopril, and Rosmarinic acid. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed to shed light on the mechanism involved in the reaction.

         <title>On the Reactivity of Phosphaalumenes towards C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphaalumenes react with alkynes and alkenes. Depending on the steric profile of the alkyne either 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes in a formal [2 2] cycloaddition or zwitterionic 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes through threefold insertion into the Al&#8722;P bond are obtained. With alkenes 1,2&#8208;phosphalumates and 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes are obtained. Computational studies corroborate the contrasting pathways and underline the role of the aluminum center.







Abstract
Heterocycles containing group 13 and 15 elements such as borazines are an integral part of organic, biomedical and materials chemistry. Surprisingly, heterocycles containing P and Al are rare. We have now utilized phosphaalumenes in reactions with alkynes, alkenes and conjugated double bond systems. With sterically demanding alkynes 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes were afforded, whereas the reaction with HCCH or HCCSiMe3 gave 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes. Using styrene saturated 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumates were formed, which reacted further with additional styrene to give different regio&#8208;isomers of 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes. Using ethylene, a 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinane is obtained, while with 1,3&#8208;butadiene a bicyclic system containing an aluminacyclopentane and a phosphirane unit was synthesized. The experimental work is supported by theoretical studies to shed light on the mechanism governing the formation of these heterocycles.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse Reaction of Azide&#8208;Ynamides via &#945;&#8208;Imino Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse of azide&#8208;ynamides via &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbenes is disclosed, enabling the practical and divergent assembly of chiral [1,4]thiazino [3,2&#8208;b]indoles in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This protocol represents the first asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and the first asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.







Abstract
[2,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp3)&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.

&lt;p&gt;[2,3]-Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper-catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via azide-ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non-diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;-imino metal carbenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substantial Improvement of an Epimerase for the Synthesis of D&#8208;Allulose by Biosensor&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Microdroplet Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified D&#8208;allulose biosensor was combined with a microdroplet screening system to establish an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening strategy. Structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution were conducted to remodel the SfDAE active pocket and its lid region for enhanced catalytic performance for the synthesis of D&#8208;allulose. This approach shows great potential for the design and optimization of biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platforms.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of D&#8208;allulose has been achieved using ketose 3&#8208;epimerases (KEases), but its application is limited by poor catalytic performance. In this study, we redesigned a genetically encoded biosensor based on a D&#8208;allulose&#8208;responsive transcriptional regulator for real&#8208;time monitoring of D&#8208;allulose. An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput droplet&#8208;based microfluidic screening platform was further constructed by coupling with this D&#8208;allulose&#8208;detecting biosensor for the directed evolution of the KEases. Structural analysis of Sinorhizobium fredii D&#8208;allulose 3&#8208;epimerase (SfDAE) revealed that a highly flexible helix/loop region exposes or occludes the catalytic center as an essential lid conformation regulating substrate recognition. We reprogrammed SfDAE using structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution, in which a mutant M3&#8208;2 was identified with 17&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency. Our research offers a paradigm for the design and optimization of a biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platform.

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;assembly of Gold(I) Complexes by Multiple Kinetic Aggregation States with Nonlinear Optical and Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the preparation of AuI self&#8208;assembled structures by controlling the equilibrium among multiple kinetic traps. Multiple kinetic traps are important in influencing its supramolecular chirality transfer process. Moreover, the achiral and chiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies showed interesting photonic properties, including optical waveguides, strong emission polarization and non&#8208;linear optical functionalities.







Abstract
Introduction of multiple kinetic aggregation states (Aggs) into the self&#8208;assembly pathway could bring complexity and flexibility to the self&#8208;assemblies, which is difficult to realize due to the delicate equilibria established among different Aggs bonded by weak noncovalent interactions. Here, we describe a series of chiral and achiral d10 AuI bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, NHC) complexes, and the achiral complex could undergo self&#8208;assembly with multiple kinetic Aggs. Generation of multiple kinetic Aggs was realized by applying chiral or achiral seeds exhibiting large differences in elongation temperatures for their respective cooperative self&#8208;assembly processes. We further showed that the chiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies having non&#8208;centrosymmetric packing forms exhibit nonlinear optical response of second harmonic generation (SHG), while the SHG signal is absent in the achiral analogue. The crystalline achiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies could function as optical waveguides with strong emission polarization.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yields in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Antimony (III) Chlorides with the [SbCl5] Geometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five pairs of antimony chlorides have been synthesized via two synthetic conditions to produce distinctively different structures and PL properties. The A2SbCl5 types with square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry and near&#8208;unity PLQY can be synthesized via diffusion method in DMF. Alternatively, when growing via solution method in HCl, the non&#8208;emissive A2Sb2Cl8 types with seesaw dimmer geometry are obtained.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic antimony halides have attracted increasing attention due to the non&#8208;toxicity, stability, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). To shed light on the structural factors that contribute to the high PLQY, five pairs of antimony halides with general formula A2SbCl5 and A2Sb2Cl8 are synthesized via two distinct methods and characterized. The A2SbCl5 type adopts square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry with near&#8208;unity PLQY, while the A2Sb2Cl8 adopts seesaw dimmer [Sb2Cl8] geometry with PLQY&#8776;0&#8201;%. Through combined data analysis with the literature, we have found that A2SbCl5 series with square pyramidal geometry generally has much longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distances, leading to more expressed lone pairs of SbIII. Additional factors including Sb&#8722;Cl distance and stability of antimony chlorides may also affect PLQY. Our targeted synthesis and correlated insights provide efficient tools to precisely form highly emissive materials for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Reduction of Sulfur Dioxide to Sulfur Monoxide by Ferrous Porphyrin
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
SO2 could be reduced to SO by an iron porphyrin via a [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ intermediate. This intermediate, which is proposed to be involved in sulfite reductase enzymes, has not been observed outside the protein matrix previously and was characterized by EPR, Mossbauer and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The SO formed could be transferred to an organic diene through a cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
The reduction of SO2 to fixed forms of sulfur can address the growing concerns regarding its detrimental effect on health and the environment as well as enable its valorization into valuable chemicals. The naturally occurring heme enzyme sulfite reductase (SiR) is known to reduce SO2 to H2S and is an integral part of the global sulfur cycle. However, its action has not yet been mimicked in artificial systems outside of the protein matrix even after several decades of structural elucidation of the enzyme. While the coordination of SO2 to transition metals is documented, its reduction using molecular catalysts has remained elusive. Herein reduction of SO2 by iron(II) tetraphenylporphyrin is demonstrated. A combination of spectroscopic data backed up by theoretical calculations indicate that FeIITPP reduces SO2 by 2e&#8722;/2H+ to form an intermediate [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ species, also proposed for SiR, which releases SO. The SO obtained from the chemical reduction of SO2 could be evidenced in the form of a cheletropic adduct of butadiene resulting in an organic sulfoxide.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Strengthened Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Degradable X&#8208;ray Detector with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility and Sensitivity</title>

This work first designed and synthesized metal&#8208;free MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O perovskites by introducing bulk methyl groups to improve tolerance factor and enhance hydrogen bonds for improving its stability and performance. Importantly, the related flexible X&#8208;ray detector shows the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and promises to realize non&#8208;toxic degradation, mechanical bending stability and array imaging for future application.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) with flexible and degradable properties have been adopted in flexible X&#8208;ray detection. For now, figuring out the key factors between structure and device performance are critical to guide the design of MFPs. Herein, MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O was first designed and synthesized with improved structural stability and device performance. Through theoretical calculations, the introducing methyl group benefits modulating tolerance factor, increases dipole moment and strengthens hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, H2O increases the hydrogen bond formation sites and synergistically realizes the band nature modulation, ionic migration inhibition and structural stiffness optimization. Spectra analysis also proves that the improved electron&#8208;phonon coupling and carrier recombination lifetime contribute to enhanced performance. Finally, a flexible and degradable X&#8208;ray detector was fabricated with the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit (0.14&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1).

         <title>Passivating Lithiated Graphite via Targeted Repair of SEI to Inhibit Exothermic Reactions in Early&#8208;Stage of Thermal Runaway for Safer Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclotrisiloxane (D3F) is triggered by LiCx to undergo ring&#8208;opening polymerization at elevated temperature (&gt;80&#8201;&#176;C), so as to targeted repair of cracked SEI. Consequently, the exothermic reaction of LiCx/electrolyte in early stage of thermal runaway is tamed by introducing D3F into routine carbonate electrolyte. Thus, the self&#8208;exothermic and TR&#8208;trigger temperatures of pouch cell with D3F are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#8201;&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The self&#8208;exothermic in early stage of thermal runaway (TR) is blasting&#8208;fuse for Li&#8208;ion battery safety issues. The exothermic reaction between lithiated graphite (LiCx) and electrolyte accounts for onset of this behavior. However, preventing the deleterious reaction still encounters hurdles. Here, we manage to inhibit this reaction by passivating LiCx in real time via targeted repair of SEI. It is shown that 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tris(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)cyclotrisiloxane (D3F) can be triggered by LiCx to undergo ring&#8208;opening polymerization at elevated temperature, so as to targeted repair of fractured SEI. Due to the high thermal stability of polymerized D3F, exothermic reaction between LiCx and electrolyte is inhibited. As a result, the self&#8208;exothermic and TR trigger temperatures of pouch cell are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#8201;&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#8201;&#176;C. This work opens up a new avenue for designing functional additives to block initial exothermal reaction and inhibit TR in early stage.

         <title>Twisting of Porphyrin by Assembly in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework yielding Chiral Photoconducting Films for Circularly&#8208;Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating functionalized porphyrin in a crystalline lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework thin film, the porphyrin core twists and becomes chiral. The chiral porphyrin thin film shows excellent optoelectronic properties with different photocurrents for right&#8208; and left&#8208;circularly polarized light.







Abstract
While materials based on organic molecules usually have either superior optoelectronic or superior chiral properties, the combination of both is scarce. Here, a crystalline chiroptical film based on porphyrin with homochiral side groups is presented. While the dissolved molecule has a planar, thus, achiral porphyrin core, upon assembly in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film, the porphyrin core is twisted and chiral. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the MOF film also results in excellent optoelectronic properties. By exciting the Soret band of porphyrin, efficient photoconduction with a high On&#8208;Off&#8208;ratio is realized. More important, handedness&#8208;dependent circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light photoconduction with a dissymmetry factor g of 4.3&#215;10&#8722;4 is obtained. We foresee the combination of such assembly&#8208;induced chirality with the rich porphyrin chemistry will enable a plethora of organic materials with exceptional chiral and optoelectronic properties.

Herein, the new conjugated units, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs) were designed and synthesized. By fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good optoelectronic integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and especially the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence was obtained.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is of great significance for the fabrication of miniaturized optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting transistors. However, great challenge exists in designing key materials, especially those who integrates triplet exciton utilization ability. Herein, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs), with 2,6&#8208;extended anthracene donor, and 3&#8242;&#8208; or 4&#8242;&#8208;substituted naphthalene monoimide acceptors were designed and synthesized. By introducing acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor structure, both materials show high electron mobility. Moreover, by fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence were obtained in 4&#8242;&#8208;DNADI. This work opens a new avenue for developing high electron mobility emissive organic semiconductors with efficient utilization of triplet excitons.

         <title>A Visible Light Driven Nickel Carbonylation Catalyst: The Synthesis of Acid Chlorides from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst has been develop. This offers a method for carbonylative coupling reactions with an earth abundant metal at ambient temperature for the conversion of alkyl halides into synthetically versatile acid chlorides. The acid chlorides can then be transformed into an array of challenging ester, thioester and amide products.







Abstract
We describe here the development of a visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst. The combination of the large bite&#8208;angle Xantphos ligand with nickel(0) generates a catalyst capable of activating alkyl halides toward carbonylation at ambient temperature in the presence of blue light irradiation, and the reductive elimination of high energy acid chloride products. Unlike classical carbonylations, where the coordination of carbon monoxide inhibits the reactivity of earth abundant nickel catalysts, a CO&#8208;associated nickel is found to be the active catalyst in the reaction. Coupling the build&#8208;up of acid chlorides with nucleophile addition can be used to access various amides, esters and thioesters, including those of sterically encumbered substrates or with metal&#8208;reactive functionalities.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Taxol Enabled by Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Radical Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol, an anticancer drug, possesses an unusually oxygenated and intricately fused 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) structure. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of taxol. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions allowed for connection of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings and cyclization of the B&#8208;ring, respectively. The ABC&#8208;ring was then converted to the target by newly devised functional and protective group manipulations.







Abstract
Taxol is a clinically used drug for the treatment of various types of cancers. Its 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) system is substituted by eight oxygen functional groups and flanked by four acyl groups, including a &#946;&#8208;amino acid side chain. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of this unusually oxygenated and intricately fused structure. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions connected the A&#8208; and C&#8208;ring fragments and cyclized the B&#8208;ring, respectively. Functional groups of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings were then efficiently decorated by employing newly developed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective reactions. Finally, construction of the D&#8208;ring and conjugation with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid delivered taxol. The powerful coupling reactions and functional group manipulations implemented in the present synthesis provide new valuable information for designing multistep target&#8208;oriented syntheses of diverse bioactive natural products.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Adduct of Atomic P(&#8722;1) as a Source of Phosphinidenes (PR), Diphosphorus (P2), and Indium Phosphide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelation approach was employed to access low&#8208;valent phosphorus centers. The resulting adducts act as P atom sources for phosphinidene (PR) transfer, indium phosphide synthesis, and neutral P2 transfer to organic substrates.







Abstract
We report phosphinidenes (PR) stabilized by an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelate. These adducts include the parent phosphinidene, PH, which is accessed via thermolysis of coordinated HPCO. The reported FLP&#8208;PH species acts as a springboard to other phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds, such as FLP&#8208;adducts of diphosphorus (P2) and InP3. Our new adducts participate in thermal&#8208; or light&#8208;induced phosphinidene elimination (of both PH and PR, R=organic group), transfer P2 units to an organic substrate, and yield the useful semiconductor InP at only 110&#8201;&#176;C from solution.

         <title>Superconductivity in an Orbital&#8208;Reoriented SnAs Square Lattice: A Case Study of Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of structure unit SnAs4 is realized via a topotactic phase transformation under high pressure, which leads to a record&#8208;high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 7.5&#8197;K among all the synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. It is the synergistic effect of orbital reorientation and charge redistribution from the pz to the px+py orbitals that facilitates the electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosts the superconductivity.







Abstract
Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs&#8208;based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure, resulting in a record&#8208;high Tc among all synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane pz orbital to the in&#8208;plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p&#8208;orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconducting systems.

         <title>Realizing Textured Zinc Metal Anodes through Regulating Electrodeposition Current for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (002) plane textured Zn metal is realized by using a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy in a low&#8208;cost Zn (CH3COO)2 aqueous electrolyte. Increasing the current density not only accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei but also boosts the growth rate of (100) crystal plane, thus enabling the final exposure of (002) surface for Zn electrodeposits.







Abstract
Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as&#8208;deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes.

Tumor&#8208;targeted and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers (1&#8208;NPs) are fabricated via co&#8208;assembly and disassembly processes, which confer burst release of small molecules 2&#8208;Gd, Zn&#8208;PPA&#8208;SH and NLG919 within tumor cells, enabling fluorescence and magnetic resonance bimodal imaging&#8208;guided sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors and deep&#8208;seated GL261 gliomas in mice upon irradiation with combined ultrasound (US) and 671&#8208;nm laser (hv).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted and stimuli&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers are highly desirable for cancer theranostics. However, designing smart nanosensitizers with multiple imaging signals and synergistic therapeutic activities switched on is challenging. Herein, we report tumor&#8208;targeted and redox&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers (1&#8208;NPs) for sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of tumors by molecular co&#8208;assembly and redox&#8208;controlled disassembly. 1&#8208;NPs show a high longitudinal relaxivity (r1=18.7&#177;0.3&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), but &#8220;off&#8221; dual fluorescence (FL) emission (at 547 and 672&#8197;nm), &#8220;off&#8221; sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibition activities. Upon reduction by glutathione (GSH), 1&#8208;NPs rapidly disassemble and remotely release small molecules 2&#8208;Gd, Zn&#8208;PPA&#8208;SH and NLG919, concurrently switching on (1)&#8197;dual FL emission, (2)&#8197;sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and (3)&#8197;IDO1 inhibition activities. After systemic injection, 1&#8208;NPs are effective for bimodal FL and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging&#8208;guided sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of orthotropic breast and brain tumors in mice under combined ultrasound (US) and 671&#8208;nm laser irradiation.

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties of a Biologically Relevant [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2] Diamond Core Motif with a Short Iron&#8208;Iron Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;closed&#8208;core&#8221; FeIII2 (&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex containing diminished Fe coordination and short Fe&#8722;Fe separation is shown to reproduce the large pre&#8208;edge intensity typically associated with the &#8220;open&#8208;core&#8221; structure in intermediate Q of soluble methane monooxygenase. This finding may broaden the scope of structural models considered for high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.







Abstract
Diiron cofactors in enzymes perform diverse challenging transformations. The structures of high valent intermediates (Q in methane monooxygenase and X in ribonucleotide reductase) are debated since Fe&#8722;Fe distances of 2.5&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#197; were attributed to &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;closed&#8221; cores with bridging or terminal oxido groups. We report the crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of a FeIII2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex (2) with tetrahedral (4C) centres and short Fe&#8722;Fe distance (2.52&#8197;&#197;), persisting in organic solutions. 2 shows a large Fe K&#8208;pre&#8208;edge intensity, which is caused by the pronounced asymmetry at the TD FeIII centres due to the short Fe&#8722;&#956;&#8722;O bonds. A &#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197; Fe&#8722;Fe distance is unlikely for six&#8208;coordinate sites in Q or X, but for a Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 core containing four&#8208;coordinate (or by possible extension five&#8208;coordinate) iron centres there may be enough flexibility to accommodate a particularly short Fe&#8722;Fe separation with intense pre&#8208;edge transition. This finding may broaden the scope of models considered for the structure of high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.

         <title>Facilitated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aerobic Environment on a Copper&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
After aerobic pretreatment, the MOF node of the hybrid catalyst was hydroxylated and exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4. Intriguingly, the addition of 20&#8201;% O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; rather, a fivefold increase was found when compared to the lack of O2.







Abstract
Herein, we fabricated a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking hybrid photocatalyst by combining two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: g&#8208;C3N4 and a Cu&#8208;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). After an aerobic photocatalytic pretreatment, this hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4 under the typical level (20&#8201;%) of O2 in the air. Intriguingly, the presence of O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; instead, a fivefold increase compared with that in the absence of O2 was observed. Structural analysis indicated that during aerobic pretreatment, the Cu node in the 2D&#8208;MOF moiety was hydroxylated by the hydroxyl generated from the reduction of O2. Then the formed hydroxylated Cu node maintained its structure during aerobic CO2 reduction, whereas it underwent structural alteration and was reductively devitalized in the absence of O2. Theoretical calculations further demonstrated that CO2 reduction, instead of O2 reduction, occurred preferentially on the hydroxylated Cu node.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Evoke Pyroptosis for High&#8208;Efficiency Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic therapeutic effect and immunogenicity of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles were studied. The nanoparticles can intrinsically induce pyroptosis accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death to further activate antitumor immunity and reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thus realizing high&#8208;efficiency immunotherapy and tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
Although zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been applied in various tumor therapies, the intrinsic immunogenicity remains unclear. Here, we initiatively discover that ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (NPs) can intrinsically induce pyroptosis by a caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;dependent pathway. The pyroptotic cell death is accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD) simultaneously for efficient in situ immunity initiation. Meanwhile, carbonyl cyanide m&#8208;chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial depolarizing agent, is successfully loaded into ZIF&#8208;8 NPs and found to further enhance the pyroptosis process. Collectively, the obtained Pluronic F127&#8208;modified CCCP&#8208;incorporated ZIF&#8208;8 NPs (F127ZIF&#8208;8CCCP NPs) activate antitumor immunity and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), realizing high&#8208;efficiency tumor growth inhibition. This work will facilitate biomedicine applications of ZIF&#8208;8 and provide good inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;induced cancer therapy.

Collectively, the obtained Pluronic F127-modified CCCP-incorporated ZIF-8 NPs (&lt;sup&gt;F127&lt;/sup&gt;ZIF-8&lt;sub&gt;CCCP&lt;/sub&gt; NPs) activate antitumor immunity and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), realizing high-efficiency tumor growth inhibition. This work will facilitate biomedicine applications of ZIF-8 and provide good inspiration for pyroptosis-induced cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimized Sieving Effect for Ethanol/Water Separation by Ultramicroporous MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent ethanol/water separation has been achieved using two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) owing to molecular sieving effect. The slightly larger rhombohedral channels in Co&#8208;squarate provide a further optimization of sieving effect by enhancing the guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. A benchmarking water adsorption capacity at ultralow pressure is obtained in Co&#8208;squarate.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity ethanol is a promising renewable energy resource, however separating ethanol from trace amount of water is extremely challenging. Herein, two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) were used as adsorbents. A prominent water adsorption and a negligible ethanol adsorption identify perfect sieving effect on both MOFs. Co&#8208;squarate exhibits a surprising water adsorption capacity at low pressure that surpassing the reported MOFs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations reveal that such prominent performance of Co&#8208;squarate derives from the optimized sieving effect through pore structure adjustment. Co&#8208;squarate with larger rhombohedral channel is suitable for zigzag water location, resulting in reinforced guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. Ultrapure ethanol (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained directly by ethanol/water mixed vapor breaking through the columns packed with Co&#8208;squarate, contributing to a potential for fuel&#8208;grade ethanol purification.

         <title>Emergence of Visible&#8208;Light Water Oxidation Upon Hexaniobate&#8208;Ligand Entrapment of Quantum&#8208;Confined Copper&#8208;Oxide Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of sensitizer&#8208;free visible&#8208;light water oxidation by CuO was achieved using water&#8208;soluble hexaniobate cluster anions to entrap quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals of the familiar earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide.







Abstract
The formation of small 1 to 3&#8197;nm organic&#8208;ligand free metal&#8208;oxide nanocrystals (NCs) is essential to utilization of their attractive size&#8208;dependent properties in electronic devices and catalysis. We now report that hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anions, [Nb6O19]8&#8722;, can arrest the growth of metal&#8208;oxide NCs and stabilize them as water&#8208;soluble complexes. This is exemplified by formation of hexaniobate&#8208;complexed 2.4&#8208;nm monoclinic&#8208;phase CuO NCs (1), whose ca. 350 Cu&#8208;atom cores feature quantum&#8208;confinement effects that impart an unprecedented ability to catalyze visible&#8208;light water oxidation with no added photosensitizers or applied potentials, and at rates exceeding those of hematite NCs. The findings point to polyoxoniobate&#8208;ligand entrapment as a potentially general method for harnessing the size&#8208;dependent properties of very small semiconductor NCs as the cores of versatile, entirely&#8208;inorganic complexes.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization: A Convenient Strategy to Realize Efficient BT.2020 Blue Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance emitter using intramolecular cyclization endows BT.2020&#8208;compliant deep blue emission with an ultranarrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.153, 0.042) in toluene, thus achieving a high external quantum efficiency of 25.6&#8201;% in a hyper&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Rationally tuning the emission position and narrowing the full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of an emitter is of great importance for many applications. By synergistically improving rigidity, strengthening the resonant strength, inhibiting molecular bending and rocking, and destabilizing the HOMO energy level, a deep&#8208;blue emitter (CZ2CO) with a peak wavelength of 440&#8197;nm and an ultranarrow spectral FWHM of 16&#8197;nm (0.10&#8197;eV) was developed via intramolecular cyclization in a carbonyl/N resonant core (QAO). The dominant &#965;0&#8208;0 transition character of CZ2CO gives a Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates (CIE) of (0.144, 0.042), nicely complying with the BT.2020 standard. Moreover, a hyper&#8208;fluorescent device based on CZ2CO shows a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 25.6&#8201;% and maintains an EQE of 22.4&#8201;% at a practical brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Low Coordination State RhI&#8208;Complex as High Performance Catalyst for Asymmetric Intramolecular Cyclopropanation: Construction of penta&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, broad&#8208;scope rhodium (I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed that allows otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access penta&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes to be prepared in a highly enantioselective manner through asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of rather challenging tri&#8208;substituted allylic diazoacetates. Extraordinary high performance of RhI/diene complex is showcased with low catalyst loading as little as 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
A simple, broad&#8208;scope rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system for challenging asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of various tri&#8208;substituted allylic diazoacetates was successfully developed. The low coordination state RhI&#8208;complex exhibits an extraordinarily high degree of tolerance to the variation in the extent of substitution of the allyl double bond, thus allowing the efficient construction of a wide range of penta&#8208;substituted, fused&#8208;ring cyclopropanes bearing three contiguous stereogenic centers, including two quaternary carbon stereocenters, in a highly enantioselective manner with ease at catalyst loading as low as 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%. The stereoinduction mode of this RhI&#8208;carbene&#8208;directed asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation was investigated by DFT calculations, indicating that &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of chiral diene ligand and diazo substrate play a key role in the control of the reaction enantioselectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a low concentration electrolyte (LCE) (0.25&#8197;M) with low solubility LiNO3 as the main salt. This LCE shows good separator wettability, high ionic conductivity, high Li+ transference number, and low cost. The rational design of the interphases enables LCE to be suitable for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, lithium metal is stabilized in the highly reactive sulfolane&#8208;based electrolyte under low concentration (0.25&#8197;M) for the first time. Inorganic&#8208;polymer hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high ionic conductivity, low bonding with lithium and high flexibility enables dense chunky lithium deposition and high plating/stripping efficiency. Low concentration electrolyte (LCE) also enables excellent cycling stability of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)/Li cells at 1&#8197;C (90.7&#8201;% retention after 500&#8197;cycles) and 0.3&#8197;C (83.3&#8201;% retention after 1000&#8197;cycles). With a low N/P ratio (&#8776;2), the capacity retention for NCM523/Li cells can achieve 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C. Exploring the LCE is of paramount significance because it provides more possibilities of the lithium salt selections, especially reviving some lithium salts that are excluded before due to their low solubility. More importantly, LCE has the significant advantage of commercialization due to its cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Synchronous Dual Electrolyte Additive Sustains Zn Metal Anode with 5600&#8197;h Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchronous dual electrolyte additive sustains reversible Zn metal anode: A dual electrolyte additive strategy is developed via the direct addition of xylitol and graphene oxide species into common zinc sulfate electrolyte. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be readily obtained under the synergistic additive regulation, thus enabling a dense and uniform deposition with a lifespan of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Despite conspicuous merits of Zn metal anodes, the commercialization is still handicapped by rampant dendrite formation and notorious side reaction. Manipulating the nucleation mode and deposition orientation of Zn is a key to rendering stabilized Zn anodes. Here, a dual electrolyte additive strategy is put forward via the direct cooperation of xylitol (XY) and graphene oxide (GO) species into typical zinc sulfate electrolyte. As verified by molecular dynamics simulations, the incorporated XY molecules could regulate the solvation structure of Zn2+, thus inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. The self&#8208;assembled GO layer is in favor of facilitating the desolvation process to accelerate reaction kinetics. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be realized under the synergistic modulation, enabling a dense and uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetric cell based on dual additives harvests a highly reversible cycling of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Ultramicroporous Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with Functionality Pair for Membrane C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with ultramicroporous structure and paired functionalities is designed and synthesized. This COF is exfoliated into large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets, enabling the fabrication of compatible hybrid membranes. The COF membranes exhibit superior acetylene/ethylene separation with high selectivity and large permeability owing to collaborative acetylene recognition and gas&#8208;transport highways.







Abstract
Gas separation efficiency of covalent organic framework (COF) membrane can be greatly elevated through precise functionalization. A pair&#8208;functionalized COF membrane of 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and isoquinoline&#8208;5,8&#8208;diamine (IQD) monomers in two and three nodes is designed and synthesized. TP&#8208;IQD is crystallized in a two&#8208;dimensional structure with a pore size of 6.5&#8197;&#197; and a surface area of 289&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. This COF possesses N&#8722;O paired groups which cooperatively interact with C2H2 instead of C2H4. TP&#8208;IQD nanosheets of &#8776;10&#8197;&#956;m in width and &#8776;4&#8197;nm in thickness are prepared by mechanical exfoliation; they are further processed with 6FDA&#8208;ODA polymer into a hybrid membrane. High porosity and functionality pair of TP&#8208;IQD offer the membrane with significantly increased C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity which are 160&#8201;% and 430&#8201;% higher of pure 6FDA&#8208;ODA. The boosted performance demonstrates high efficiency of the pair&#8208;functionality strategy for the synthesis of separation&#8208;led COFs.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Isomeric Naphthalene&#8208;Based 2D Kagome Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted synthesis of two isomeric naphthalene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with Kagome topology is realized by rational design of isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different length of substituents. The specific pore structures of the two isomeric frameworks result in a significant difference in spatial immobilization of C60 guests. Incorporation of C60 into m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF increases the photoconductivity of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, presumably due to the enhanced charge transfer effect.







Abstract
Targeted synthesis of kagome (kgm) topologic 2D covalent organic frameworks remains challenging, presumably due to the severe dependence on building units and synthetic conditions. Herein, two isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different lengths of substituted arms based on naphthalene core (p&#8208;Naph and m&#8208;Naph) are elaborately designed and utilized for the defined synthesis of isomeric kgm Naph&#8208;COFs. The two isomeric frameworks exhibit splendid crystallinity and showcase the same chemical composition and topologic structure with, however, different pore channels. Interestingly, C60 is able to uniformly be encapsulated into the triangle channels of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF via in situ incorporation method, while not the isomeric p&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, likely due to the different pore structures of the two isomeric COFs. The resulting stable C60@m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF composite exhibits much higher photoconductivity than the m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF owing to charge transfer between the conjugated skeletons and C60 guests.

         <title>Ligand Dilution Analysis Facilitates Aptamer Binding Characterization at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily implemented membrane&#8208;receptor&#8208;analysis method termed ligand dilution analysis, combining the concepts of single&#8208;molecule localization and random sampling, is reported. Aptamer binding characterization, including receptor density calculation, single&#8208;molecule colocalization, binding site determination, motion and fluctuation analysis, is performed with minimal probe and instrument requirements.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single&#8208;molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity.

&lt;p&gt;An easily implemented membrane-receptor-analysis method termed ligand dilution analysis, combining the concepts of single-molecule localization and random sampling, is reported. Aptamer binding characterization, including receptor density calculation, single-molecule colocalization, binding site determination, motion and fluctuation analysis, is performed with minimal probe and instrument requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell-specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single-molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity. Therefore, we herein propose a random sampling-based analysis strategy termed ligand dilution analysis (LDA) for easily implemented aptamer-based receptor study. Receptor density on the cell surface can be calculated based on a regression model. By using a synergistic ligand dilution design, colocalization and differentiation of aptamer and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding on a single receptor can be realized. Once this is accomplished, precise binding site and detailed aptamer-receptor binding mode can be further determined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand dilution strategy also sets the stage for an aptamer-based dynamics analysis of two- and three-dimensional motion and fluctuation of highly expressed receptors on the live cell membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, we report a synthesis of cyclohexanones bearing multi&#8208;continuous stereocenters by combining copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of dialkylzinc reagents to cyclic enones with iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction. Good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity can be obtained. The current reaction can achieve the stereodivergent construction of nonadjacent stereocenters.







Abstract

Unlike the stereodivergent construction of adjacent stereocenters (1,2&#8208;position) reported in the literature, the current reaction can achieve the stereodivergent construction of nonadjacent stereocenters (1,3&#8208;position) by a proper combination of two chiral catalysts with different enantiomers.

         <title>De&#8208;Linker&#8208;Enabled Exceptional Volumetric Acetylene Storage Capacity and Benchmark C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Benchmark acetylene adsorbents come to existence via novel cluster&#8208;cluster&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks designed by a de&#8208;linker strategy and are capable of reaching the highest acetylene storage capacity, top&#8208;level IAST selectivity, benchmark breakthrough interval time, and extraordinary productivity for C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures.







Abstract
An ideal adsorbent for separation requires optimizing both storage capacity and selectivity, but maximizing both or achieving a desired balance remain challenging. Herein, a de&#8208;linker strategy is proposed to address this issue for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Broadly speaking, the de&#8208;linker idea targets a class of materials that may be viewed as being intermediate between zeolites and MOFs. Its feasibility is shown here by a series of ultra&#8208;microporous MOFs (SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;M, M=Mn, Co, Ni, Zn). SNNU&#8208;98 exhibit high volumetric C2H2 uptake capacity under low and ambient pressures (175.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 @ 0.1&#8197;bar, 222.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 @ 1&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), as well as extraordinary selectivity (2405.7 for C2H2/C2H4, 22.7 for C2H2/CO2). Remarkably, SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;Mn can efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with a benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) breakthrough time of 2325&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1, and produce 99.9999&#8201;% C2H4 with a productivity up to 64.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing values of reported MOF adsorbents.

         <title>Designing High&#8208;Donicity Anions for Rechargeable Potassium Superoxide/Peroxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the concept of &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; design, the asymmetric anion (MPSA&#8722;) with high donicity was synthesized and validated to boost the reversibility of potassium superoxide/peroxide redox without any electrocatalysts. Such anions could effectively retard the electrode passivation with enhanced discharge capacity and facilitate the K2O2 decomposition out of the substrate.







Abstract
A battery cathode based on the superoxide/peroxide redox not only inherits the advantage of oxygen (O2) batteries in high capacities and low costs but also overcomes the disadvantages in O2 storage, electrolyte evaporation, and anode deactivation due to O2 crossover. Herein, we report an enhanced potassium superoxide (KO2)/peroxide (K2O2) conversion by adopting a high&#8208;donicity anion additive in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Such an anion was synthesized via a &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; strategy and validated to enhance the electron donicity of the electrolyte. The use of high&#8208;donicity anion could lead to enhanced KO2 utilization (&#8776;90.2&#8201;%) by retarding electrode passivation and allow the full charging back of K2O2 through the solution&#8208;mediated pathway without electrocatalysts. No apparent cell degradation is observed during the first 120&#8197;cycles by controlling the reversible depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge capacity at 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1
 within an O2&#8208;free region. The K&#8722;KO2 cell delivers a high energy efficiency (&gt;84.4&#8201;%) and a lifespan of over 1440&#8197;hours.

         <title>Direct Deprotonative Functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethyl Ketones using a Catalytic Organosuperbase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deprotonation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones is underinvestigated due to the instability of the generated carbanion that can evolve into a fluorocarbene. A method for the deprotonative functionalization of these compounds is described herein under an organocatalytic system using various electrophiles, and is also applied to a related &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl sulfoxide. This strategy gives access to highly valuable difluoromethylene scaffolds.







Abstract
The deprotonative functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones is described herein. Using a catalytic organosuperbase and a silane additive, the corresponding difluoroenolate could be generated and trapped with aldehydes to deliver various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones in high yields. This new strategy tolerates numerous functional groups and represents the access to the difluoroenolate by direct deprotonation of the difluoromethyl unit. The diastereoselective version of the reaction was also investigated with d.r. up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7. Several transformations were performed to demonstrate the synthetic potential of these &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. In addition, this method has been extended to the use of other electrophiles such as imines and chalcogen derivatives, and a difluoromethyl sulfoxide as nucleophile, thus leading to a diversity of difluoromethylene compounds.

     alt="Direct Deprotonative Functionalization of &#945;,&#945;-Difluoromethyl Ketones using a Catalytic Organosuperbase"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deprotonation of &#945;,&#945;-difluoromethyl ketones is underinvestigated due to the instability of the generated carbanion that can evolve into a fluorocarbene. A method for the deprotonative functionalization of these compounds is described herein under an organocatalytic system using various electrophiles, and is also applied to a related &#945;,&#945;-difluoromethyl sulfoxide. This strategy gives access to highly valuable difluoromethylene scaffolds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deprotonative functionalization of &#945;,&#945;-difluoromethyl ketones is described herein. Using a catalytic organosuperbase and a silane additive, the corresponding difluoroenolate could be generated and trapped with aldehydes to deliver various &#945;,&#945;-difluoro-&#946;-hydroxy ketones in high yields. This new strategy tolerates numerous functional groups and represents the access to the difluoroenolate by direct deprotonation of the difluoromethyl unit. The diastereoselective version of the reaction was also investigated with &lt;i&gt;d.r&lt;/i&gt;. up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7. Several transformations were performed to demonstrate the synthetic potential of these &#945;,&#945;-difluoro-&#946;-hydroxy ketones. In addition, this method has been extended to the use of other electrophiles such as imines and chalcogen derivatives, and a difluoromethyl sulfoxide as nucleophile, thus leading to a diversity of difluoromethylene compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designed Iron Catalysts for Allylic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Propylene and Simple Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl complex was discovered to enable the coupling of the allylic carbon of propylene and carbonyl electrophiles. This approach was also successfully applied to allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of simple olefins. Experimental and computational studies provided insights into the mechanism and origins of ligand effects on reactivity and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Propylene gas is produced worldwide by steam cracking on million&#8208;metric&#8208;ton scale per year. It serves as a valuable starting material for &#960;&#8208;bond functionalization but is rarely applied in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H functionalization for fine chemical synthesis. Herein, we report that a newly&#8208;developed cationic cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl complex allows for the conversion of propylene to its allylic C&#8722;C bond coupling products under catalytic conditions. This approach was also found applicable to the allylic functionalization of simple &#945;&#8208;olefins with distinctive branched selectivity. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies supported the allylic deprotonation of the metal&#8208;coordinated alkene as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and led to insights into the multifaceted roles of the newly designed ligand in promoting allylic C&#8722;H functionalization with enhanced reactivity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Incorporated Sn Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our work, a facile hydrolysis method was developed to synthesize halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalysts. The introduction and retention of halogen dopants were verified by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn and as a result promoted CO2RR to formate, while suppressing the competing CO2RR to CO and HER.







Abstract
Electrochemically reducing CO2 to valuable fuels or feedstocks is recognized as a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the crises of fossil fuel shortage and carbon emission. Sn&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to make formic acid/formate, which unfortunately still suffer from low activity, selectivity and stability. In this work, halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) was introduced into the Sn catalyst by a facile hydrolysis method. The presence of halogen was confirmed by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn in halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst as compared to unmodified Sn under cathodic potentials in CO2RR and therefore tuned the adsorption strength of the key intermediate (*OCHO) toward formate formation. As a result, the halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2RR to produce formate.

         <title>Correlating the Experimentally Determined CO Adsorption Enthalpy with the Electrochemical CO Reduction Performance on Cu Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectroscopic method was developed to measure the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces at electrochemical conditions. The adsorption enthalpy of CO on dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;VSHE was determined to be 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Measured CO adsorption enthalpies on two different Cu electrodes were correlated with their activities in the electrochemical reduction of CO.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been widely employed as a descriptor for effective catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR), however, it has yet to be determined experimentally at electrochemical interfaces due to the lack of suitable techniques. In this work, we developed a method to determine the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces with quantitative surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. On dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#8776;37.9&#177;13.4&#8197;J/(mol&#8201;K), and &#8776;&#8722;9.8&#177;4.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide&#8208;derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products. The method developed in this work will help establish the correlation between the CO binding energy and the CO(2)RR activity.

         <title>Manganese(II)&#8208;Guided Separation in the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Regime for Precise Identification of In Vivo Size Dependence</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a facile one&#8208;step in situ Mn2+&#8208;guided centrifugation strategy to synthesize large&#8208;scale ultrasmall AuNPs with the size gradient decrease precisely controlled at the sub&#8208;nanometer regime, and further demonstrate that the sub&#8208;nanometer size differences (approximately 0.5&#8197;nm) significantly alter the non&#8208;specific phagocytosis of AuNPs in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, elimination rate, and nanotoxicology.







Abstract
A precise understanding of nano&#8208;bio interactions in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime is necessary for advancements in nanomedicine. However, this is currently hindered by the control of the nanoparticle size in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. Herein, we report a facile in situ Mn2+&#8208;guided centrifugation strategy for the synthesis of large&#8208;scale ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a precisely controlled size gradient at the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. With the discovery that [Mn(OH)]+, especially metallic manganese (Mn0@[Mn(OH)]+) nanoparticles, could selectively interact with larger AuNPs through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding to form aggregates, we also realized the fast (&lt;1&#8197;h) synthesis of water&#8208;soluble atomically precise Au25 with high yields (&gt;56&#8201;%). We further demonstrated that sub&#8208;nanometer size differences (approximately 0.5&#8197;nm) significantly alter non&#8208;specific phagocytosis of AuNPs in the reticuloendothelial system macrophages, elimination rate, and nanotoxicology.

An electron&#8208;deficient tetrafluoronaphthodithiophene (FNT) was created to construct a family of PFNT&#8208;F/Cl polymers for organic solar cells. The PFNT&#8208;F/Cl&#8208;based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53&#8201;% and 18.10&#8201;%, suggesting multifluorinated polymers are promising donor materials for non&#8208;fullerene OSCs.







Abstract
Creating new electron&#8208;deficient unit is highly demanded to develop high&#8208;performance polymer donors for non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we reported a multifluorinated unit 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluoronaphtho[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithio&#8208;phene (FNT) and its polymers PFNT&#8208;F and PFNT&#8208;Cl. The advantages of multifluorination: (1) it enables the polymers to exhibit low&#8208;lying HOMO (&#8776;&#8722;5.5&#8197;eV) and wide band gap (&#8776;2.0&#8197;eV); (2) the short interactions (F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H, F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F) endow the polymers with properties of high film crystallinity and efficient hole transport; (3) well miscibility with NFAs that leads to a more well&#8208;defined nanofibrous morphology and face&#8208;on orientation in the blend films. Therefore, the PFNT&#8208;F/Cl&#8201;:&#8201;N3 based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53&#8201;% and 18.10&#8201;%, which make them ranked the best donor materials in OSCs. This work offers new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance polymers by multifluorination strategy.

         <title>Development of a General and Selective Nanostructured Cobalt Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Benzofurans, Indoles and Benzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrolysis of Co&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid template on silica resulted in stable and reusable Co/Co3O4 core&#8211;shell nanostructured catalyst which allows for the selective hydrogenation of benzofurans as well as indoles and benzothiophenes.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of benzofurans in the presence of a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal catalyst is reported. The developed optimal catalytic material consists of cobalt&#8208;cobalt oxide core&#8211;shell nanoparticles supported on silica, which has been prepared by the immobilization and pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid complex on silica under argon at 800&#8201;&#176;C. This novel catalyst allows for the selective hydrogenation of simple and functionalized benzofurans to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans as well as related heterocycles. The versatility of the reported protocol is showcased by the reduction of selected drugs and deuteration of heterocycles. Further, the stability, recycling, and reusability of the Co&#8208;nanocatalyst are demonstrated.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Mixed&#8208;Linker Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Switchable Semiconductive Characteristics for Tailorable Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>

Mixed&#8208;linker MOF system Mn2 [TTF]x [NiS4]1&#8722;x (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and sensing performances. The variation of linker ratios changed the electrical conductivity of MOFs and induced a switch of n&#8208;type/p&#8208;type semiconducting behaviors. By adjusting the ratio of the two linkers in MOFs, we realized the fabrication and optimization of volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors for different application scenarios.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), with diverse metal nodes and designable organic linkers, offer unique opportunities for the rational engineering of semiconducting properties. In this work, we report a mixed&#8208;linker conductive MOF system with both tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) moieties, which allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and semiconductive characteristics. By continuously increasing the molar ratio between tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene), the switching of the semiconducting behaviors from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type was observed along with an increase in electrical conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude (from 2.88&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 to 9.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1). Furthermore, mixed&#8208;linker MOFs were applied for the chemiresistive detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), where the sensing performance was modulated by the corresponding linker ratios, showing synergistic and nonlinear modulation effects.

         <title>Oral Anticancer Heterobimetallic PtIV&#8722;AuI Complexes Show High In Vivo Activity and Low Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral anticancer heterobimetallic PtIV&#8722;AuI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes with a dual mechanism of action show high potency with low toxicity in vivo. The conjugation of two metals results in an enhanced inhibitory effect towards thioredoxin reductase and facilitates the co&#8208;transport of the prodrug into the tumor before activation.







Abstract
AuI&#8208;carbene and PtIV&#8722;AuI&#8208;carbene prodrugs display low to sub&#8208;&#956;M activity against several cancer cell lines and overcome cisplatin (cisPt) resistance. Linking a cisPt&#8208;derived PtIV(phenylbutyrate) complex to a AuI&#8208;phenylimidazolylidene complex 2, yielded the most potent prodrug. While in vivo tests against Lewis Lung Carcinoma showed that the prodrug PtIV(phenylbutyrate)&#8208;AuI&#8208;carbene (7) and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;administration of cisPt: phenylbutyrate:2 efficiently inhibited tumor growth (&#8776;95&#8201;%), much better than 2 (75&#8201;%) or cisPt (84&#8201;%), 7 exhibited only 5&#8201;% body weight loss compared to 14&#8201;% for 2, 20&#8201;% for cisPt and &gt;30&#8201;% for the co&#8208;administration. 7 was much more efficient than 2 at inhibiting TrxR activity in the isolated enzyme, in cells and in the tumor, even though it was much less efficient than 2 at binding to selenocysteine peptides modeling the active site of TrxR. Organ distribution and laser&#8208;ablation (LA)&#8208;ICP&#8208;TOFMS imaging suggest that 7 arrives intact at the tumor and is activated there.

         <title>Allosteric Regulation of Aptamer Affinity through Mechano&#8208;Chemical Coupling
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a simple and effective strategy for reversibly fine&#8208;tuning aptamer affinity by an allosteric molecular clamp that perturbs aptamer folding through mechanical extension, forcing it into a state in which its binding competency is considerably reduced. Aptamer affinity is regulated by tuning the mechanical properties of the molecular clamp.







Abstract
The capacity to precisely modulate aptamer affinity is important for a wide variety of applications. However, most such engineering strategies entail laborious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing or require prior knowledge of an aptamer's structure and ligand&#8208;binding domain. We describe here a simple and generalizable strategy for allosteric modulation of aptamer affinity by employing a double&#8208;stranded molecular clamp that destabilizes aptamer secondary structure through mechanical tension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer and show that we can alter its affinity by as much as 65&#8208;fold. We also show that this modulation can be rendered reversible by introducing a restriction enzyme cleavage site into the molecular clamp domain and describe a design strategy for achieving even more finely&#8208;tuned affinity modulation. This strategy requires no prior knowledge of the aptamer's structure and binding mechanism and should thus be generalizable across aptamers.

         <title>Exited State Absorption Upconversion Induced by Structural Defects for Photocatalysis with a Breakthrough Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>

Herein, a kind of novel excited state absorption (ESA) mode g&#8208;C3Nx nanosheet up&#8208;conversion materials with structural defects N2C has been developed and the working mechanism was demonstrated in detail here (two photons way with the defect level in the band gap). The quantum yield of optimum sample is as high as 0.64&#8201;%, which was much higher than that of traditional ESA mode (&#8776;10&#8722;4).







Abstract
The nitrogen&#8208;deficient graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been prepared, a new excited state absorption (ESA) up&#8208;conversion mode is discovered, which is directly induced by structural defects, showing distinct chemical characteristics from those based on lanthanide ions and triplet states chromophores. The abundant N2C vacancies in g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets work as the crucial intermediate excitation states, which lead to g&#8208;C3N4 upconverted emitting at the wavelength of 436&#8197;nm excited by the light with the wavelength of 800&#8197;nm. This process is proven to proceed via a two&#8208;photon involved ESA mode with a breakthrough quantum efficiency of 0.64&#8201;%. Further, we combine N2C vacancies enriched g&#8208;C3N4 with In2S3 and CdS, and successfully achieved an infrared light driven photocatalytic reactions. These findings offered a new family of up&#8208;conversion materials; more semiconductors with various structural defects are potential complementary members.

         <title>Double Asymmetric Core Optimizes Crystal Packing to Enable Selenophene&#8208;based Acceptor with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomeric A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A type double asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were synthesized by a n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl regioisomeric strategy to optimize single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance. PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl achieved a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain tailoring is a promising method to optimize the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, asymmetric alkyl chain&#8208;based small molecular acceptors (SMAs) are still difficult to afford. Herein, we adopted a novel asymmetric n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl substitution strategy and synthesized two A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A double asymmetric isomeric SMAs with asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based central core for OSCs. Crystallographic analysis indicates that AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl forms a more compact and order intermolecular packing compared to AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl, which contributed to higher electron mobility in neat AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl film. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl blend film shows a better morphology with appropriate phase separation and distinct face&#8208;on orientation than PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl. The OSCs with PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl obtain a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl (17.52&#8201;%), which is the best efficiency for the selenium&#8208;incorporated SMAs in binary BHJ OSCs. Our findings elucidate that the promising double asymmetric strategy with isomeric alkyl chains precisely modulates the crystal packing and enhances the photovoltaic efficiency of selenophene&#8208;incorporated SMAs.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Ni/V2O3 Heterostructure Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach was developed to fabricate a low&#8208;cost Ni/V2O3 heterostructure catalyst, which can efficiently and stably catalyze the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Ni/V2O3 interface sites can optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable HOR performance.







Abstract
Alkaline fuel cells can permit the adoption of platinum group metal&#8208;free (PGM&#8208;free) catalysts and cheap bipolar plates, thus further lowering the cost. With the exploration of PGM&#8208;free hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts, nickel&#8208;based compounds have been considered as the most promising HOR catalysts in alkali. Here we report an interfacial engineering through the formation of nickel&#8208;vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) heterostructures to activate Ni for efficient HOR catalysis in alkali. The strong electron transfer from Ni to V2O3 could modulate the electronic structure of Ni sites. The optimal Ni/V2O3 catalyst exhibits a high intrinsic activity of 0.038&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni/V2O3 interface as the active sites can enable to optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable activity and durability.

Graphene belts with high electron spin concentrations, which were synthesized by C (sp2)&#8722;C (sp2) radical coupling, act as aerobic spin catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine; the catalytic mechanism has been studied by electron spin resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Here, we report kinetic studies using electron spin resonance spectroscopy on spin catalysis reactions caused by using graphene belts which were synthesized by a radical coupling method. The results show that &#963;&#8208;type free radical species provide the dominant sites for catalytic activity through the spin&#8208;spin interaction, although there are some other influencing factors. The spin catalysis mechanism can be applied both in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and in organic synthesis. The graphene belt spin catalyst shows excellent performance with a high ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V and long&#8208;term stability with almost no loss of activity after 50&#8201;000 cycles in alkaline media. It also shows excellent performance in a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine at an average conversion of &#8776;97.7&#8201;% and an average yield of &#8776;97.9&#8201;%. This work opens up a new research direction for understanding aerobic processes in the field of spin catalysis.

         <title>Guanidine Additive Enabled Intermolecular ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde&#8208;Amine&#8208;Thiol Three&#8208;Component Reactions for Modular Constructions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reaction were realized through the use of a guanidine additive. This method enables the construction of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates in a modular fashion, and it is anticipated that it will open up new and diverse opportunities to access new conjugate structures for chemical biology, medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.







Abstract
Recently, ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) is experiencing a renascence for the modification of proteins and peptides through OPA&#8208;amine two&#8208;component reactions for bioconjugation and intramolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reactions for cyclization. Historically, small thiol molecules were used in large excess to allow for the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol reaction forming 1&#8208;thio&#8208;isoindole derivatives. In this study, we discovered that guanidine could serve as an effective additive to switch the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reaction to a stoichiometric process and enable the modular construction of peptide&#8208;peptide, and peptide&#8208;drug conjugate structures. Thus, 12 model peptide&#8208;peptide conjugates have been synthesized from unprotected peptides featuring all proteinogenic residues. Besides, 6 peptide&#8208;drug conjugates have been prepared in one step, with excellent conversions and isolated yields. In addition, a conjugate product has been further functionalized by utilizing a premodified OPA derivative, demonstrating the versatility and flexibility of this reaction.

         <title>Revealing the Formation Mechanism and Optimizing the Synthesis Conditions of Layered Double Hydroxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a way to investigate the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on layered double hydroxide (LDH) formation. The results revealed the formation mechanism of LDHs and also guided the synthesis of a library of LDHs with desired attributes, in water at room temperature without using any additives.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), whose formation is strongly related to OH&#8722; concentration, have attracted significant interest in various fields. However, the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on LDHs&#8217; formation has not been fully explored due to the unsuitability of the existing synthesis methods for in situ characterization. Here, the deliberately designed combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a solution to the above problem. The obtained results revealed the formation mechanism and also guided us to synthesize a library of LDHs with the desired attributes in water at room temperature without using any additives. After evaluating their oxygen evolution reaction performance, we found that FeNi&#8208;LDH with a Fe/Ni ratio of 25/75 exhibits one of the best performances so far reported.

         <title>Accelerated Transfer and Spillover of Carbon Monoxide through Tandem Catalysis for Kinetics&#8208;boosted Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique *CO transfer and spillover strategy was developed by fabricating Ni single atom supported on pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon as a *CO donor for feeding Cu NPs with *CO, boosting the coverage of *CO on Cu NPs and subsequently improving the selectivity for CO2&#8208;C2H4 conversion.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been widely applied in electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to produce multicarbon (C2+) feedstocks (e.g., C2H4). However, the high energy barriers for CO2 activation on the Cu surface is a challenge for a high catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. Herein, we developed an in situ *CO generation and spillover strategy by engineering single Ni atoms on a pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon support with a sodalite (SOD) topology (Ni&#8208;SOD/NC) that acted as a donor to feed adjacent Cu nanoparticles (NPs) with *CO intermediate. As a result, a high C2H4 selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% and an industrial&#8208;level current density of 160&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of &#8722;0.72&#8197;V were achieved. Our studies revealed that the isolated NiN3 active sites with adjacent pyridinic N species facilitated the *CO desorption and the massive *CO intermediate released from Ni&#8208;SOD/NC then overflowed to Cu NPs surface to enrich the *CO coverage for improving the selectivity of CO2ER to C2H4.

         <title>Tetramine Aspect Ratio and Flexibility Determine Framework Symmetry for Zn8L6 Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric design rules for the assembly of metal&#8208;organic capsules were derived. The preferred diastereomeric configurations of Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubes, with T, Th, S6 and D3 symmetry, are shown to depend upon the aspect ratio and conformational flexibility of their constituent rectangular subunits. Computational methods allowed further design principles to be deciphered.







Abstract
We derive design principles for the assembly of rectangular tetramines into Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubic coordination cages. Because of the rectangular, as opposed to square, geometry of the ligand panels, and the possibility of either &#916; or &#923; handedness of each metal center at the eight corners of the pseudo&#8208;cube, many different cage diastereomers are possible. Each of the six tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponents investigated in this work assembled with zinc(II) and 2&#8208;formylpyridine in acetonitrile into a single Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cube diastereomer, however. Each product corresponded to one of four diastereomeric configurations, with T, Th, S6 or D3 symmetry. The preferred diastereomer for a given tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponent was shown to be dependent on its aspect ratio and conformational flexibility. Analysis of computationally modeled individual faces or whole pseudo&#8208;cubes provided insight as to why the observed diastereomers were favored.

         <title>Fully Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 Complex: Strong Cu&#8208;Cu interaction and Fast Electron Self&#8208;Exchange Rate Despite Large Structural Changes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicopper complexes in the CuICuI and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 states have been synthesized and comprehensively characterized, revealing a high delocalization energy of the mixed&#8208;valent species comparable with the biological CuA site. Fast electron self&#8208;exchange is suggested to occur via a sequential ET pathway, involving an active conformational isomer of the flexible CuICuI species, pointing to a potential gating scenario for ET.







Abstract
A flexible macrocyclic ligand with two tridentate {CNC} compartments can host two Cu ions in reversibly interconvertible states, CuICuI (1) and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 (2). They were characterized by XRD and multiple spectroscopic methods, including EPR, UV/Vis absorption and MCD, in combination with TD&#8208;DFT and CASSCF calculations. 2 features a short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu distance (&#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197;; compared to &#8776;4.0&#8197;&#197; in 1) and a very high delocalization energy of 13&#8201;000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, comparable to the mixed&#8208;valent state of the biological CuA site. Electron self&#8208;exchange between 1 and 2 is rapid despite large structural reorganization, and is proposed to proceed via a sequential mechanism involving an active conformer of 1, viz. 1&#8242;; the latter has been characterized by XRD. Such electron transfer (ET) process is reminiscent of the conformationally gated ET proposed for biological systems. This redox couple is a unique pair of flexible dicopper complexes, achieving fast electron self&#8208;exchange closely related to the function of the CuA site.

         <title>Modulating Cation Migration and Deposition with Xylitol Additive and Oriented Reconstruction of Hydrogen Bonds for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrolyte engineering strategy based on the usage of a small amount of xylitol additive is first proposed, which inhibits the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and SO42&#8722; ions in the primary solvation shell through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Highly reversible plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes is one of the critical processes determining the performance of Zn&#8208;ion batteries, but it is severely impeded by the parasitic side reaction and dendrite growth. Herein, a novel electrolyte engineering strategy is first proposed based on the usage of 100&#8197;mM xylitol additive, which inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening electrostatic interaction through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. Concomitantly, xylitol molecules are preferentially adsorbed by Zn surface, which provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress the planar diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Zn2+ transference number and cycling lifespan of Zn&#8741;Zn cells have been significantly elevated, overwhelmingly larger than bare ZnSO4. The cell coupled with a NaV3O8 cathode still behaves much better than the additive&#8208;free device in terms of capacity retention.

         <title>A BiVO4 Photoanode with a VOx Layer Bearing Oxygen Vacancies Offers Improved Charge Transfer and Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium oxide with enriched oxygen vacancies (VOx) was developed as an efficient oxygen evolution cocatalyst for BiVO4 photoanodes. The optimized BiVO4/VOx photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.29&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5&#8197;G illumination, and a high charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of 96&#8201;% is attained. Stable PEC water splitting is achieved for 40&#8197;h.







Abstract
Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics are one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. To address this issue, we report a vanadium oxide (VOx) with enriched oxygen vacancies conformally grown on BiVO4 photoanodes by a simple photo&#8208;assisted electrodeposition process. The optimized BiVO4/VOx photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 6.29&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5&#8197;G illumination, which is ca. 385&#8201;% as high as that of its pristine counterpart. A high charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of 96&#8201;% is achieved and stable PEC water splitting is realized, with a photocurrent retention rate of 88.3&#8201;% upon 40&#8197;h of testing. The excellent PEC performance is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in VOx that forms undercoordinated sites, which strengthen the adsorption of water molecules onto the active sites and promote charge transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This work demonstrates the potential of vanadium&#8208;based catalysts for PEC water oxidation.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Energy Storage Devices: Novel Benzothiadiazole Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Olefin&#8208;Linked COFs</title>

We report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COFs exhibit an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We shed light onto the charge&#8208;storage mechanism through the benzothiadiazole units in the COFs electrodes via computational and experimental analyses.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials for energy storage applications exhibiting enhanced electrochemical performance. While most of the reported organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries use carbonyl groups as electrochemically&#8208;active sites, their high hydrophilicity in aqueous electrolytes represents a critical drawback. Herein, we report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT synthesized via the aldol condensation between 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TMT) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)dibenzaldehyde (BT), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT exhibits an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the charge&#8208;storage mechanism in COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT electrodes is based on the supramolecularly engineered and reversible Zn2+ coordination by the benzothiadiazole units.

Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the charge-storage mechanism in COF-TMT-BT electrodes is based on the supramolecularly engineered and reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination by the benzothiadiazole units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation of FeIV=O and its Contribution to Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions on a Single&#8208;Atom Iron&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalyst</title>

Iron atoms with a Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance of 4&#8197;&#197; are the real active sites for generating FeIV=O in Fenton&#8208;like reactions, forming a complex through dual&#8208;site adsorption of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as the key step. The versatile FeIV=O species promotes the overall oxidizing capacity, pH tolerance, and stability of a Fenton&#8208;like system for water treatment.







Abstract
Generating FeIV=O on single&#8208;atom catalysts by Fenton&#8208;like reaction has been established for water treatment; however, the FeIV=O generation pathway and oxidation behavior remain obscure. Employing an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with a typical Fe&#8722;N4 moiety to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS), we demonstrate that generating FeIV=O is mediated by an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;PMS* complex&#8212;a well&#8208;recognized nonradical species for induction of electron&#8208;transfer oxidation&#8212;and we determined that adjacent Fe sites with a specific Fe1&#8722;Fe1 distance are required. After the Fe atoms with an Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance &lt;4&#8197;&#197; are PMS&#8208;saturated, Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;PMS* formed on Fe sites with an Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance of 4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197; can coordinate with the adjacent FeII&#8722;N4, forming an inter&#8208;complex with enhanced charge transfer to produce FeIV=O. FeIV=O enables the Fenton&#8208;like system to efficiently oxidize various pollutants in a substrate&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;tolerant, and sustainable manner, where its prominent contribution manifests for pollutants with higher one&#8208;electron oxidation potential.

         <title>Promoting Surface Electric Conductivity for High&#8208;Rate LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to design the high&#8208;rate cathode materials is proposed and validated through tuning the surface electron transport. By constructing a highly conductive surface on LiCoO2 (LCO) particles, the effective voltage (Veff) was improved, thus driving more Li+ extraction/insertion under the same external voltage (Vo), and making LCO exhibit a superior rate performance as well as the excellent cycling stability at high rates.







Abstract
The cathode materials work as the host framework for both Li+ diffusion and electron transport in Li&#8208;ion batteries. The Li+ diffusion property is always the research focus, while the electron transport property is less studied. Herein, we propose a unique strategy to elevate the rate performance through promoting the surface electric conductivity. Specifically, a disordered rock&#8208;salt phase was coherently constructed at the surface of LiCoO2, promoting the surface electric conductivity by over one magnitude. It increased the effective voltage (Veff) imposed in the bulk, thus driving more Li+ extraction/insertion and making LiCoO2 exhibit superior rate capability (154&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C), and excellent cycling performance (93&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 10&#8197;C). The universality of this strategy was confirmed by another surface design and a simulation. Our findings provide a new angle for developing high&#8208;rate cathode materials by tuning the surface electron transport property.

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption of Epoxy&#8208;Functional Nanoparticles onto Stainless Steel Significantly Reduces Friction in Tribological Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of epoxy groups into sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles leads to their efficient chemical adsorption onto stainless steel whereas the corresponding non&#8208;functional nanoparticles merely undergo physical adsorption. Significantly greater adsorption occurs when the epoxy groups are placed within the steric stabilizer chains, which leads to enhanced lubrication in tribology studies.







Abstract
Epoxy&#8208;functional sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (ca. 27&#8197;nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil. Nanoparticle adsorption onto stainless steel is examined using a quartz crystal microbalance. Incorporating epoxy groups within the steric stabilizer chains results in a two&#8208;fold increase in the adsorbed amount, &#915;, at 20&#8201;&#176;C (7.6&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2) compared to epoxy&#8208;core functional nanoparticles (3.7&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2) or non&#8208;functional nanoparticles (3.8&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2). A larger difference in &#915; is observed at 40&#8201;&#176;C; this suggests chemical adsorption of the nanoparticles rather than merely physical adsorption. A remarkable near five&#8208;fold increase in &#915; is observed for ca. 50&#8197;nm epoxy&#8208;functional nanoparticles compared to non&#8208;functional nanoparticles (31.3 vs. 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively). Tribological studies confirm that chemical adsorption of the latter epoxy&#8208;functional nanoparticles leads to a significant reduction in friction between 60&#8201;&#176;C and 120&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Ultrathin CuF2&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Induced by Cation&#8208;Tailored Double Electrical Layer toward Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin and CuF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase is formed on CuS anode via Cu cation&#8208;tailored double electrical layer in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures high ion&#8208;conductivity and greatly suppresses the electrolyte continuous decomposition. The modified CuS enables high reversible capacity and ultralong cycling life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) seriously affects battery's cycling life, especially for high&#8208;capacity anode due to excessive electrolyte decomposition from particle fracture. Herein, we report an ultrathin SEI (3&#8211;4&#8197;nm) induced by Cu+&#8208;tailored double electrical layer (EDL) to suppress electrolyte consumption and enhance cycling stability of CuS anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unique EDL with SO3CF3&#8208;Cu complex absorbing on CuS in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte is demonstrated by in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, Cyro&#8208;TEM and theoretical calculation, in which SO3CF3&#8208;Cu could be reduced to CuF2&#8208;rich SEI. Dispersed CuF2 and F&#8208;containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption and reduce activation energy of Na+ transport. As a result, the modified CuS delivers high capacity of 402.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 7000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. The insights of SEI construction pave a way for high&#8208;stability electrode.

Unique EDL with SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu complex absorbing on CuS in NaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/diglyme electrolyte is demonstrated by in situ surface-enhanced Raman, &lt;i&gt;Cyro-&lt;/i&gt;TEM and theoretical calculation, in which SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu could be reduced to CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich SEI. Dispersed CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and F-containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption and reduce activation energy of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. As a result, the modified CuS delivers high capacity of 402.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 7000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. The insights of SEI construction pave a way for high-stability electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium&#8208;ion Mobility in Li6B18(Li3N) and Li Vacancy Tuning in the Solid Solution Li6B18(Li3N)1&#8722;x(Li2O)x</title>

         <dc:description>
A new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure is reported. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18 (Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 55Li7N] strands. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18 (Li3N) and Li6B18 (Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are promising candidates for safe energy&#8208;storage systems due to non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes and the possibility to use metallic lithium as an anode. Thus, there is a challenge to design new solid electrolytes and to understand the principles of ion conduction on an atomic scale. We report on a new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18(Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 
Li7N] strands that represent a perfect cutout from the structure of &#945;&#8208;Li3N. Variable&#8208;temperature 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveals a very high Li mobility in the template phase with a remarkably low activation energy below 19&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and thus much lower than pristine Li3N. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18(Li3N) and Li6B18(Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.

A polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon (PCH1) containing four contiguous heptagons was synthesized by Juan Casado, Junzhi Liu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202217124). The four contiguous heptagons form a Z&#8197;shape in the central &#960;&#8208;electron skeleton, giving PCH1 a butterfly&#8208;shaped conformation.

A chiral metal&#8208;organic framework film with optoelectronic properties based on functionalized porphyrin molecules is presented by Mariana Kozlowska, Lars Heinke et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202217377). While the porphyrin molecules in solution (red) are planar, as common porphyrin, the porphyrin cores are twisted and chiral upon assembly in the metal&#8208;organic framework. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the film result in excellent photoconduction properties and sensitivity to circularly polarized light.

         <title>Inside Cover: Blocked Phosphates as Photolatent Catalysts for Dynamic Photopolymer Networks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 10/2023)</title>

A temperature&#8208;resistant organic phosphate with a photolabile o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group is introduced in a visible light curable thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, as reported by Sandra Schl&#246;gl, Thomas Griesser et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202215525). The sequence&#8208;dependent &#955;&#8208;orthogonality of the curing and cleavage enables an efficient network formation at 451&#8197;nm, without premature release of the catalyst. Once the photopolymer is cured, irradiation at 372&#8197;nm spatiotemporally activates the phosphate, which catalyzes transesterifications at elevated temperature.

         <title>The First Synthesis of Subporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free base subporphyrin, also called subporphyrin can be seen as a contracted porphyrin analogue. Despite its postulated importance, its study was limited by a challenging synthesis while the first isolation of boron (III) subporphyrins was accomplished about 15&#8197;years ago. In a recent report, Kim, Osuka, and Song successfully met this challenge. This seminal work will hopefully pave the road to rich chemistries and applications in materials science.







Abstract
Because of the rich coordination chemistry and unique optical and electrochemical properties, porphyrin analogues have been intensively investigated. Among them, subporphyrins have been long&#8208;awaited molecules, with only their boron complexes known to date because of the crucial role of the central boron atom as a template in synthesis. The challenges related to the synthesis of a genuine subporphyrin (boron&#8208;free) have finally been met and reported in a recent article from Kim, Osuka, and Song. A key strategy of their synthesis lies in the introduction of an exocyclic double bond at the meso&#8208;position and subsequent reduction to obtain macrocyclic conjugation. Considering the fact that the development of porphyrin chemistry is ultimately linked to the availability of free base porphyrins, this seminal work will facilitate studies on coordination chemistry and applications in materials science.

         <title>Nanostructured Heterogeneous Catalysts for Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the use of Pd&#8208;, Au&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions are reviewed and discussed in detail. Synthetic strategies, applications, and external stimuli&#8208;driven processes are compiled, setting the basis for future development in this field.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry has inspired a new subarea of chemistry providing a powerful tool to perform novel biocompatible chemospecific reactions in living systems. Following the premise that they do not interfere with biological functions, bioorthogonal reactions are increasingly applied in biomedical research, particularly with respect to genetic encoding systems, fluorogenic reactions for bioimaging, and cancer therapy. This Minireview compiles recent advances in the use of heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions. The synthetic strategies of Pd&#8208;, Au&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;based materials, their applicability in the activation of caged fluorophores and prodrugs, and the possibilities of using external stimuli to release therapeutic substances at a specific location in a diseased tissue are discussed. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this emerging field.

         <title>Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives on Nitrogen Electrochemistry for Carbon&#8208;Neutral Energy Technologies</title>

         <dc:description>
A closed nitrogen cycle utilizing electrochemical processes can be established between N2, NH3, and HNO3. Four essential reactions constitute an overall picture of the nitrogen transformation system, which facilitates the realization of a global carbon&#8208;free green energy network, and remedies the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle, along with the concomitant environmental crisis.







Abstract
Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable nitrogen economy. Synergistically combining multiple nitrogen reactions can realize efficient renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises. Here, we provide a unique aspect to discuss the intriguing nitrogen electrochemistry by linking three essential nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds (i.e., N2, NH3, and NO3&#8722;) and integrating four essential electrochemical reactions, i.e., the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH3OR). This minireview also summarizes the acquired knowledge of rational catalyst design and underlying reaction mechanisms for these interlinked nitrogen reactions. We further underscore the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen&#8208;based economy.

Tf2O has been widely used in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progresses of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles, and nitro groups for the development of new reactions, and as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagents in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride has been widely used in synthetic organic chemistry, not only for the conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing compounds to the triflates, but also for the electrophilic activation and further conversion of amides, sulfoxides, and phosphorus oxides. In recent years, the utilization of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles and nitro groups has become a promising tool for the development of new valuable methods with considerable success. In addition, Tf2O has been used as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagent due to the contained SO2CF3 fragment, and significant progress has been made in this area. This review summarizes the recent progress in the applications of Tf2O in the above two aspects, and aims to illustrate the role and potential application of this reagent in organic synthesis.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oral and Transdermal Protein Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and peptide therapies are expanding for disease treatment, and the development of non&#8208;invasive or mini&#8208;invasive delivery systems is essential to improve patient compliance and therapeutic outcomes. This review provides an overview of recent advances in materials, formulations, and technologies developed to overcome biological barriers to the oral and transdermal delivery of proteins.







Abstract
Protein and peptide drugs are predominantly administered by injection to achieve high bioavailability, but this greatly compromises patient compliance. Oral and transdermal drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and high adherence represent attractive alternatives to injection administration. However, oral and transdermal administration of bioactive proteins must overcome biological barriers, namely the gastrointestinal and skin barriers, respectively. The rapid development of new materials and technologies promises to address these physiological obstacles. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in oral and transdermal protein delivery, including chemical strategies, synthetic nanoparticles, medical microdevices, and biomimetic systems for oral administration, as well as chemical enhancers, physical approaches, and microneedles in transdermal delivery. We also discuss challenges and future perspectives of the field with a focus on innovation and translation.

         <title>Direct Probe of Electrochemical Pseudocapacitive pH Jump at a Graphene Electrode
</title>

         <dc:description>
Using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation, we probe the structure and orientation of interfacial water at a graphene electrode and find phase transition&#8208;like changes. We attribute it to local pH change&#8208;induced pseudocapacitive charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate of the graphene electrode. Our work evidences the molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;level insight into interfacial water at a buried electrode interface is essential in electrochemistry, but spectroscopic probing of the interface remains challenging. Here, using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy, we directly access the interfacial water in contact with the graphene electrode supported on calcium fluoride (CaF2). We find phase transition&#8208;like variations of the HD&#8208;SFG spectra vs. applied potentials, which arises not from the charging/discharging of graphene but from the charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate through the pseudocapacitive process. The potential&#8208;dependent spectra are nearly identical to the pH&#8208;dependent spectra, evidencing that the pseudocapacitive behavior is associated with a substantial local pH change induced by water dissociation between the CaF2 and graphene. Our work evidences the local molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Glass&#8208;Ceramic From a New Polar Phase&#8208;Transition Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>

A new polar hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3 [Ni (NCS)5], features uncommon thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal transitions under mild conditions, allowing an easy fabrication of an unprecedented hybrid glass&#8208;ceramic that exhibits 25.6&#8197;times enhanced intrinsic SHG effect than its poly&#8208;crystalline form.







Abstract
Melt&#8208;quenched glasses of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals, i.e., hybrid glasses, have attracted increasing attention as an emerging class of hybrid materials with beneficial processability and formability in the past years. Herein, we present a new hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3[Ni(NCS)5] (1, Ph3PEt+=ethyl(triphenyl)phosphonium), crystallizing in a polar space group P1 and exhibiting thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal transitions with relatively low melting temperature of 132&#8201;&#176;C, glass&#8208;transition temperature of 40&#8201;&#176;C, and recrystallization on&#8208;set temperature of 78&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Taking advantage of such mild conditions, we fabricated an unprecedented hybrid glass&#8208;ceramic thin film, i.e., a thin glass uniformly embedding inner polar micro&#8208;crystals, which exhibits a much enhanced intrinsic second&#8208;order nonlinear optical effect, being ca. 25.6 and 3.1&#8197;times those of poly&#8208;crystalline 1 and KH2PO4, respectively, without any poling treatments.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Controlled Radical Branching Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble inibramer, sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate, triggered branching during photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization of methacrylate monomers in the open air. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymers with controlled molecular weights, degrees of branching, and low dispersity values were obtained in water. The radical branching polymerization also exhibited spatial control and enabled the synthesis of branched polymer bioconjugates.







Abstract
Hyperbranched polymethacrylates were synthesized by green&#8208;light&#8208;induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) under biologically relevant conditions in the open air. Sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate (SBA) was prepared in situ from commercially available 2&#8208;bromoacrylic acid and used as a water&#8208;soluble inibramer to induce branching during the copolymerization of methacrylate monomers. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymethacrylates were obtained in less than 30&#8197;min with predetermined molecular weights (36&#8201;000&lt;Mn&lt;170&#8201;000), tunable degree of branching, and low dispersity values (1.14&#8804;&#272;&#8804;1.33). Moreover, the use of SBA inibramer enabled the synthesis of bioconjugates with a well&#8208;controlled branched architecture.

         <title>Monitoring Photoinduced Interparticle Chemical Communication In Situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ monitoring of photoinduced chemical communication between single Ag nanoparticles is achieved via the stochastic collision electrochemistry. The superior sensitivity enables to investigate the dynamic chemical potential difference at the single&#8208;nanoparticle level, indicating the cooperative interparticle communication controls the morphology transformation kinetics, thereby determining the final structure of collective Ag nanoparticles.







Abstract
Monitoring interparticle chemical communication plays a critical role in the nanomaterial synthesis as this communication controls the final structure and stability of global nanoparticles (NPs). Yet most ensemble analytical techniques, which could only reveal average macroscopic information, are unable to elucidate NP&#8208;to&#8208;NP interactions. Herein, we employ stochastic collision electrochemistry to track the morphology transformation of Ag NPs in photochemical process at the single NP level. By further statistical analysis of time&#8208;resolved current transients, we quantitatively determine the dynamic chemical potential difference and interparticle communication between populations of large and small Ag NPs. The high sensitivity of stochastic collision electrochemistry enables the in situ investigation of chemical communication&#8208;dependent transformation kinetics of NPs in photochemical process, shedding light on designing nanomaterials.

         <title>Generation of Allylmagnesium Reagents by Hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium hydride, generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride and magnesium iodide in tetrahydrofuran, was found capable of inducing regio and stereocontrolled hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes to form allylmagnesium species. Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium species with various electrophiles provided synthetically valuable synthons such as homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes.







Abstract
A protocol for the generation of allylmagnesium reagents from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes was developed using magnesium hydride (MgH2) that is generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride (NaH) and magnesium iodide (MgI2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds or alkyl (pseudo)halides delivers branched products having an allylic quaternary carbon center, whereas that with chlorosilanes resulted in formation of linear allylsilanes in regio and stereoselective manners. Further derivatizations of the homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes were also demonstrated.

         <title>Dynamics and Proton Conduction of Heterogeneously Confined Imidazole in Porous Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole confined in porous coordination polymers&#8217; channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of typical core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model, in which the core&#8208;layer possess faster rotating dynamics contributing to enhanced proton conductivity.







Abstract
The nanoconfinement of proton carrier molecules may contribute to the lowing of their proton dissociation energy. However, the free proton transportation does not occur as easily as in liquid due to the restricted molecular motion from surface attraction. To resolve the puzzle, herein, imidazole is confined in the channels of porous coordination polymers with tunable geometries, and their electric/structural relaxations are quantified. Imidazole confined in a square&#8208;shape channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model. The core and shell layer possess faster and slower structural dynamics, respectively, when compared to the bulk imidazole. The dimensions and geometry of the nanochannels play an important role in both the shielding of the blocking effect from attractive surfaces and the frustration filling of the internal proton carrier molecules, ultimately contributing to the fast dynamics and enhanced proton conductivity.

         <title>Synthesis of a Dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbon and the Impact of Non&#8208;Alternant Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon (1) has been synthesized with four contiguous heptagons that form a &#8220;Z&#8221; shape in the central &#960;&#8208;electron skeleton. The inner heptalene unit in 1 shows antiaromatic properties. PCH 1 presents narrow HOMO/LUMO energy gap as a result of the HOMO and LUMO displaying a significantly asymmetric distribution.







Abstract
Incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) can significantly affect their electronic and optoelectronic properties and chemical reactivities. Here, we report the first bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;embedded PCH (1) with four continuous heptagons, which are arranged in a &#8220;Z&#8221; shape. Compared with its structural isomer bischrysene 1&#8201;R with only hexagonal rings, compound 1 presents a distinct antiaromatic character, especially the inner heptalene core, which possesses clear antiaromatic nature. In addition, PCH 1 exhibits a narrower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap than its benzenoid contrast 1&#8201;R, as verified by experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Our work reported herein not only provides a new way to synthesize novel PCHs with non&#8208;alternant topologies but also offers the possibility to tune their electronic and optical properties.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Superstructures via Hierarchical Assemblies of Giant Rubik's Cubes as Tertiary Building Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building unit, two unprecedented giant superclusters in Rubik's cube's form have been constructed, which further act as isolable tertiary building units to assemble cluster&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Capture of intermediate states clearly and systematically demonstrates the evolution of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures.







Abstract
Intricate superstructures possess unusual structural features and promising applications. The preparation of superstructures with single&#8208;crystalline nature are conducive to understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship, however, remains an intriguing challenge. Herein we put forward a new hierarchical assembly strategy towards rational and precise construction of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Firstly, two unprecedented superclusters in Rubik's cube's form with a size of &#8776;2&#215;2&#215;2&#8197;nm3 are constructed by aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building units (SBUs). Then, the Rubik's cubes further act as isolable tertiary building units (TBUs) to assemble diversified single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Importantly, intermediate assembly states are captured, which helps illustrate the evolution of TBU&#8208;based superstructures and thus provides a profound understanding of the assembly process of superstructures at the atomic level.

         <title>Spectroscopic Identification of Diphosphene HPPH and Isomeric Diphosphinyldene PPH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simplest diphosphene HPPH (cis and trans conformers) and diphosphinyldene PPH2 have been generated and spectroscopically characterized in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10&#8197;K. In addition to the photo&#8208;induced conversion of these P2H2 isomers, the prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties have been disclosed.







Abstract
The simplest diphosphene HPPH and isomeric diphosphinyldene PPH2 features prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties that have been of long&#8208;standing interest in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the observation of cis&#8208;HPPH, trans&#8208;HPPH, and PPH2 among the respective laser photolysis products of phosphine (PH3) and diphosphine (P2H4) in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10&#8197;K. The identification of these P2H2 isomers with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy is supported by D&#8208;isotope labeling and the quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;F12 level using configuration&#8208;selective vibrational configuration interaction theory (VCI). Bonding analyses suggest that the two conformers of HPPH contain standard PP double bonds, whereas, PPH2 resembles P2 in having partial PP triple bond due to the H2P&#8592;P &#960; bonding interaction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Lengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of multidentate ligands is made to successfully construct metal&#8208;backboned polymers with well&#8208;defined lengths and excellent optical, electrochemical, thermal and solution properties, representing a general and effective strategy to the creation of a new type of functional polymers.







Abstract
Constructing the backbones of polymers with metal atoms is an attractive strategy to develop new functional polymeric materials, but it has yet to be studied due to synthetic challenges. Here, metal atoms are interconnected as the backbones of polymers to yield metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs). Rational design of multidentate ligands synthesized via an efficient iterative approach leads to the successful construction of a series of nickel&#8208;backboned polymers (NBPs) with well&#8208;defined lengths and up to 21 nickel atoms, whose structures are systematically confirmed. These NBPs exhibit strong and length&#8208;depended absorption with narrow band gaps, offering promising applications in optoelectronic devices and semiconductors. We also demonstrate the high thermal stability and solution processsability of such nickel&#8208;backboned polymers. Our results represent a new opportunity to design and synthesize a variety of new metal&#8208;backboned polymers for promising applications in the future.

         <title>Blocked Phosphates as Photolatent Catalysts for Dynamic Photopolymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photolatent organophosphate is synthesized and introduced into a resin system, which is 3D printed with visible light. The subsequently UV&#8208;released transesterification catalyst activates dynamic exchange reactions at elevated temperatures. Without affecting the thermal stability of the polymer network, bond exchange reactions and shape memory can be spatiotemporally controlled.







Abstract
While latent catalysts are a well&#8208;established strategy for initiating and controlling the rate of polymerization reactions, their use in dynamic polymer networks is still in its infancy. The ideal latent catalyst should be thermally stable and release a highly active species in response to an external trigger. Here, we have synthesized a temperature resistant (&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) organic phosphate with a photolabile o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group that can be cleaved by UV light. Introduced in a visible light curable thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, the sequence&#8208;dependent &#955;&#8208;orthogonality of the curing and cleavage enables an efficient network formation at 451&#8197;nm, without premature release of the catalyst. Once cured, irradiation at 372&#8197;nm spatiotemporally activates the phosphate, which catalyzes transesterifications at elevated temperature. The formed catalyst has no effect on the thermal stability of the polymeric network and allows the activation of bond exchange reactions in selected domains of printed 3D objects.
