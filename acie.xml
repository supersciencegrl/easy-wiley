         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8208; and NO2&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8208; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8208;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4 mg&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8% at &#8208;0.42 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8208;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO3&#8208;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH3 evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>A Semisynthesis Platform for the Efficient Production and Exploration of Didemnin&#8208;Based Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plitidepsin (or dehydrodidemnin B), an approved anti&#8208;cancer drug, belongs to the didemnin family of cyclic depsipeptides, which are found in limited quantities in marine tunicate extracts. Here, we introduce a new approach that integrates microbial and chemical synthesis to generate plitidepsin and its analogues. We screened a Tistrella strain library to identify a potent didemnin B producer, and then introduced a second copy of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster into its genome, resulting in a didemnin B titre of approximately 75 mg/L. Next, we developed two straightforward chemical strategies to convert didemnin B to plitidepsin, one of which involved a one&#8208;step synthetic route giving over 90% overall yield. Furthermore, we synthesised 13 new didemnin derivatives and three didemnin probes, enabling research into structure&#8211;activity relationships and interactions between didemnin and proteins. Our study highlights the synergistic potential of biosynthesis and chemical synthesis in overcoming the challenge of producing complex natural products sustainably and at scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Based Fully Non&#8208;fused Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) are still suffering from the low light utilization and unstable under ultraviolet irradiation. To tackle these challenge s, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;fused acceptor based on 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as &#960;&#8208;bridge unit, denoted as GS70, which serves as active layer in the front&#8208;cell for constructing tandem OSCs with a parallel configuration. Benefiting from the well&#8208;complementary absorption spectra with the rear&#8208;cell, GS70&#8208;based parallel tandem OSCs exhibit an improved photoelectron response over the range between 600&#8208;700 nm, yielding a high short&#8208;circuit current density of 28.4 mA cm&#8722;2. The improvement in light utilization translates to a power conversion efficiency of 19.4%, the highest value among all parallel tandem OSCs. Notably, owing to the intrinsic stability of GS70, the manufactured parallel tandem OSCs retain 84.9% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 1000 hours. Overall, this work offers novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost and stability non&#8208;fused acceptors, emphasizing the importance of adopting a parallel tandem configuration for achieving efficient light harvesting and improved photostability in OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Turn&#8208;On Strategy to Profile E2&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination Events in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8208;E2&#8208;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, which controls many different aspects of cellular signaling. The role of the E2 has been largely overlooked, despite influencing substrate identity, chain multiplicity, and topology. Here we report a method &#8211; targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2 (tCUbE) &#8211; that can track a tagged ubiquitin through its entire enzymatic cascade in living mammalian cells. We use this approach to reveal new targets whose ubiquitination depends on UbcH5a E2 activity. We demonstrate that tCUbE can be broadly applied to multiple E2s and in different human cell lines. tCUbE is uniquely suited to examine E2&#8208;E3&#8208;substrate cascades of interest and/or piece together previously unidentified cascades, thereby illuminating entire branches of the UPS and providing critical insight that will be useful for identifying new therapeutic targets in the UPS.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Formate on Copper Electrodes Modified by Cationic Gemini Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity and activity of formate over the copper electrode are dramatically promoted by the modification of cationic Gemini surfactants. Furthermore, on a Gemini surfactant modified Bi2O3 electrode, a formate FE of 91&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This improvement in formate production was attributed to the combined effects of the cations and alkyl chains present in the Gemini surfactants.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising strategy to mitigate energy and environmental problems. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity for a single product and inadequate electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the first work to use cationic Gemini surfactants as modifiers to boost CO2 electroreduction to formate. The selectivity, activity and stability of the catalysts can be all significantly enhanced by Gemini surfactant modification. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate could reach up to 96&#8201;%, and the energy efficiency (EE) could achieve 71&#8201;% over the Gemini surfactants modified Cu electrode. In addition, the Gemini surfactants modified commercial Bi2O3 nanosheets also showed an excellent catalytic performance, and the FE of formate reached 91&#8201;% with a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using the flow cell. Detailed studies demonstrated that the double quaternary ammonium cations and alkyl chains of the Gemini surfactants played a crucial role in boosting electroreduction CO2, which can not only stabilize the key intermediate HCOO* but also provide an easy access for CO2. These observations could shine light on the rational design of organic modifiers for promoted CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Multivariate Machine Learning Models of Nanoscale Porosity from Ultrafast NMR Relaxometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoporous materials are of great interest in many applications, such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage.

         <title>Electrooxidative Rhodium(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8210;H Annulation of Sulfoximines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8211;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox&#8208;neutral C&#8208;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8211;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8210;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield and 98:2 er). The practicality of this method was demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate was isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with over 19% Efficiency and Enhanced Morphology Stability Enabled by Asymmetric Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) for commercialization remains a challenging task. Herein, we designed asymmetric acceptors DT&#8208;C8Cl and DT&#8208;C8BTz with functional haloalkyl chains, in which the halogen atoms could induce noncovalent interactions with heteroatoms like O, S, and Se, etc., thus leading to appropriately manipulated film morphology. Consequently, binary devices based on D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.40%. The higher PCE of D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl could be attributed to the enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses. In addition, the noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions and thereby reduce trap density of states, leading to improved thermal and storage stability. Overall, our findings reveal that the rational design of asymmetric acceptors with functional haloalkyl chains is a novel and powerful strategy for simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Approach for Z&#8208;Vinyl Fluorides by Hydrofluorination of Alkynes bearing SF4 and SF5 Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and stereoselective approach for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups has been reported. TBAF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O exhibits high compatibility, allowing for easy incorporation of fluoride into SF5 and SF4 alkynes at room temperature. Competitive experiments and DFT calculations verify that SF5 alkynes react much faster than SF4 alkynes.







Abstract
The synthesis of vinyl fluorides plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Herein, we present a direct and stereoselective hydrofluorination method for the synthesis of Z isomers of vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups. Our strategy employed tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as a fluorine source. It demonstrates high compatibility with aryls, biaryls, heteroaryls, and tert&#8208;alkyl groups, allowing facile incorporation of SF5 and SF4 groups across the triple bond without any transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach avoids the potential decomposition of the SF5 or SF4 units via coordination with transition metals or acidic protic sources. Remarkably, this transformation proceeded at room temperature without any additional additives, providing the Z isomer of vinyl fluorides in excellent yield and high selectivity. The presence of a water molecule as a hydrate in TBAF is essential for efficient conversion. This methodology opens new avenues for the synthesis of enchanting SF5&#8208; and SF4&#8208;containing fluorinated vinylic scaffolds, thereby providing advanced opportunities for novel drug discovery and fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Ultrastable, Superrobust, and Recyclable Supramolecular Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to strengthen and stabilize the supramolecular polymer network is reported. The superb multivalence cooperation makes the hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect, resulting in a superroubst and recyclable supramolecular polymer network with remarkably high resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and H&#8208;bond&#8208;destructive solvents.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs), crosslinked by noncovalent bonds, have emerged as reorganizable and recyclable polymeric materials with unique functionality. However, poor stability is an imperative challenge faced by SPNs, because SPNs are susceptible to heat, water, and/or solvents due to the dynamic and reversible nature of noncovalent bonds. Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H&#8208;bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H&#8208;bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H&#8208;bonds. The rationally designed H&#8208;bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H&#8208;bond arrays comprising higher&#8208;density and stronger H&#8208;bonds. Consequently, the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on&#8208;demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1&#8197;GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3). Despite the covalent&#8208;network&#8208;like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high&#8208;polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.

         <title>Senolysis Enabled by Senescent Cell&#8208;Sensitive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal chemistry&#8208;based senolytic strategy for the selective treatment of senescent cells has been developed. We demonstrate that a dihydrotetrazine&#8208;galactose conjugate (Gal&#8208;Tz) can be selectively converted into the free tetrazine by senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This strategy can be harnessed for bioorthogonal imaging as well as prodrug delivery and activation in senescent cancer cells.







Abstract
Although the clearance of senescent cells has been proven to slow down the aging process and promote anti&#8208;cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell&#8208;sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is based on linking dihydrotetrazine (Tz) to a galactose (Gal) moiety that serves both as a recognition moiety for senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and a caging group for the control of tetrazine activity. Gal&#8208;Tz enables efficient click&#8208;release of a fluorescent hemicyanine and doxorubicin from a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non&#8208;senescent counterparts with a 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for the selective activation and delivery of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO&#8208;ARV&#8208;771 can be selectively activated by Gal&#8208;Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce the degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4. Senolytic PROTACs may offer an efficient way for intervention on cell senescence thanks to their unique capacity to degrade target proteins in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of this study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.

We demonstrate that a dihydrotetrazine-galactose conjugate (Gal-Tz) can be selectively converted into the free tetrazine by senescence-associated &#946;-galactosidase. This strategy can be harnessed for bioorthogonal imaging as well as prodrug delivery and activation in senescent cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the clearance of senescent cells has been proven to slow down the aging process and promote anti-cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell-sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is based on linking dihydrotetrazine (Tz) to a galactose (Gal) moiety that serves both as a recognition moiety for senescence-associated &#946;-galactosidase and a caging group for the control of tetrazine activity. Gal-Tz enables efficient click-release of a fluorescent hemicyanine and doxorubicin from a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene-caged prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non-senescent counterparts with a 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for the selective activation and delivery of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO-ARV-771 can be selectively activated by Gal-Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce the degradation of bromodomain-containing protein 4. Senolytic PROTACs may offer an efficient way for intervention on cell senescence thanks to their unique capacity to degrade target proteins in a sub-stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of this study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered W18O49&#8722;x Nanobrush with a Suitable Band Structure for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV was prepared by a solvothermal method for efficient sonodynamic therapy. Abundant oxygen vacancies were introduced into the nanobrush through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction reaction and can serve as charge traps to inhibit e&#8722;&#8208;h+ recombination. The almost ideal band structures of the nanobrush endow it with the potential to simultaneously produce 1O2, &#8901;O2&#8722;, and &#8901;OH under ultrasound irradiation.







Abstract
With the rapid development of external minimally invasive or noninvasive therapeutic modalities, ultrasound&#8208;based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new alternative for treating deep tumors. However, inadequate sonosensitizer efficiency and poor biosecurity limit clinical applications. In this study, we prepared an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV for highly efficient SDT using a simple solvothermal method. The suitable band structures of the W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush endows it with the potential to simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;), and hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) under ultrasound irradiation. Additionally, abundant oxygen vacancies that serve as further charge traps that inhibit electron&#8208;hole recombination are incidentally introduced through one&#8208;step thermal reduction. Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush delivers highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT in a very biosafe manner. Overall, this study provides a new avenue for discovering and designing inorganic nanosonosensitizers with enhanced therapeutic efficiencies for use in SDT.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics with a Membrane&#8208;Embedded Electron Shuttle Mimics the Bioenergy Anabolism of Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism is achieved by synthetic electron shuttle&#8208;activated transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture. It offers a new and efficient route to realize artificial bioenergy production, holding great promise in ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.







Abstract
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism through transmembrane redox reactions in artificial systems remains a great challenge. Here, we explore synthetic electron shuttle to activate transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture for augmenting bioenergy anabolism. In this nanoarchitecture, a dendritic mesoporous silica microparticle as inner compartment possesses higher load capacity of NADH as proton source and allows faster mass transfer. In addition, the outer compartment ATP synthase&#8208;reconstituted proteoliposomes. Like natural enzymes in the mitochondrion respiratory chain, a small synthetic electron shuttle embedded in the lipid bilayer facilely mediates transmembrane redox reactions to convert NADH into NAD+ and a proton. These facilitate an enhanced outward proton gradient to drive ATP synthase to rotate for catalytic ATP synthesis with improved performance in a sustainable manner. This work opens a new avenue to achieve enhanced bioenergy anabolism by utilizing a synthetic electron shuttle and tuning inner nanostructures, holding great promise in wide&#8208;range ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes with Dual Negatively Curved Heptagons: Extensive Synthesis and Spontaneous Resolution into Strippable Homochiral Lamellae with Helical Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctive &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with fused negative curvature and helicity have been facilely synthesized by twofold heptagonal cyclization. In addition to intriguing features arising from the dynamic chiral skeleton, the molecular packing of these curved helicenes can be modulated by the periphery groups and the extension of the skeleton. This leads to the formation of crystals with 31 helices and also homochiral nanosheets upon exfoliation.







Abstract
We report a unique category of &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with double negative curvatures. This is achieved by two&#8208;fold regioselective heptagonal cyclization of the oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole precursors through either intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation or Scholl reaction. The fusion of two heptagonal rings in the helical skeleton dramatically increases the intramolecular strain and forces the two terminal carbazole moieties to stack in a compressed fashion. The presence of the deformable negatively curved heptagonal rings endows the resulting diaza[7]helicenes with dynamic chiral skeletons, aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature and relatively low racemization barrier of ca. 25.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Further &#960;&#8208;extension on the carbazole moieties subsequently leads to a more sophisticated C2&#8208;symmetric homochiral triple helicene. Notably, these &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes show structure&#8208;dependent stacking upon crystallization, switching from heterochiral packing to intra&#8208;layer homochiral stacking. Interestingly, the C2&#8208;symmetric triple helicene molecules spontaneously resolve into a homochiral lamellar structure with 31 helix symmetry. Upon ultrasonication in a nonsolvent, the crystals can be readily exfoliated into large&#8208;area ultrathin nanosheets with height of ca. 4.4&#8197;nm corresponding to two layers of stacked triple helicene molecules and relatively thicker nanosheets constituted by even&#8208;numbered molecular lamellae. Moreover, regular hexagonal thin platelets with size larger than 30&#8197;&#956;m can be readily fabricated by flash aggregation.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Trace Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Rate and Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives are inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, which implements a dual remodeling effect on Zn2+ solvation shell and Zn surface molecules, facilitating long&#8208;term stable and high&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion batteries at ultra&#8208;low temperatures.







Abstract
High&#8208;rate and stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries working at low temperatures are highly desirable for practical applications, but are challenged by sluggish kinetics and severe corrosion. Herein, inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, we report trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives that implement a dual remodeling effect for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The additive with high Zn absorbability not only remodels Zn2+ primary solvent shell by alternating H2O molecules, but also forms a shielding layer thus remodeling the Zn surface, which effectively enhances fast Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation reaction kinetics and prohibits Zn anode corrosion. Taking trace &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (&#945;DG) as a demonstration, the electrolyte obtains a low freezing point of &#8722;55.3&#8201;&#176;C, and the Zn//Zn cell can stably cycle for 2000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C, with a high cumulative capacity of 5000&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A full battery that stably operates for 10000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is also demonstrated.

         <title>Lithiophilic Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Coating for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable polyimide 2D covalent organic framework (COF), which has abundant lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units within the 1D channels. The COF can serve as an intermediate layer to guide the uniform electrodeposition of lithium ion, leading to the formation of dense and smooth lithium deposition layer in a cylindrical morphology and steady lithium plating/stripping behaviors.







Abstract
The growth of disorganized lithium dendrites and weak solid electrolyte interphase greatly impede the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new kind of stable polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which have a high density of well&#8208;aligned lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units anchored within the uniform one&#8208;dimensional channels. The COFs can serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anode, effectively guiding the uniform deposition of lithium ions and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. The unsymmetrical Li||COF&#8722;Cu battery exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which can be well retained up to 400&#8197;cycles. Meanwhile, the Li&#8208;COF||LFP full cell shows a Coulombic efficiency over 99&#8201;% at a charge of 0.3&#8197;C. And its capacity can be well maintained up to 91&#8201;% even after 150&#8197;cycles. Therefore, the significant electrochemical cycling stability illustrates the feasibility of employing COFs in solving the disordered deposition of lithium ions in lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Rapid Synthesis of MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Ni Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts within 3&#8197;min. Specifically, the optimized single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon materials (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) based on a metal&#8211;organic framework precursor showcases a tremendous CO partial current density of 1.06&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96&#8201;% in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the common electric heating techniques to produce carbon&#8208;based SACs usually suffer from prolonged heating time and tedious operations. Herein, a general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based SACs within 3&#8197;min without inert gas protection. The obtained carbon&#8208;based SACs present high porosity and comparable carbonization degree to those obtained by electric heating techniques. Specifically, the single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) derived from a Ni&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) exhibits remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (96&#8201;%) with a substantial CO partial current density (jCO) up to 1.06&#8197;A/cm2 in CO2 electroreduction, far superior to the counterpart obtained by traditional pyrolysis with electric heating. Mechanism investigations reveal that the resulting Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C presents abundant defective sites and mesoporous structure, greatly facilitating CO2 adsorption and mass transfer. This work establishes a versatile approach to rapid and large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs as well as other carbon&#8208;based materials for efficient catalysis.

         <title>Dynamic Shape Change of Liquid Crystal Polymer Based on An Order&#8208;Order Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodomain liquid crystal polymer exhibits dynamic shape changes, undergoing extension first and then contraction during both heating and cooling. This behavior is driven by a dynamic order&#8208;order smectic C to smectic A phase transition.







Abstract
Liquid crystal actuators conventionally undergo shape changes across an order&#8208;disorder phase transition between liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic phases. In this study, we introduce an innovative Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) actuator harnessing an order&#8208;order LC phase transition mechanism. The LCP film is easily stretchable within the LC phase, facilitated by the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl groups serving as robust physical crosslinking points, and thereby transforms to a stable monodomain structure. The resultant monodomain LCP actuator shows a distinctive reversible dynamic shape change, exhibiting extension followed by contraction along the LC director on cooling. The extension is propelled by the reversible smectic C to smectic A phase transition, and the contraction is attributed to the re&#8208;entry to the smectic C phase from smectic A phase. Thermal annealing temperature determines this peculiar dynamic shape change, which occurs during both heating and cooling processes. This pivotal attribute finds manifestation in gripper and flower&#8208;shaped actuators, adeptly executing grabbing and releasing as well as blooming and closure motions within a single thermal stimulation. In essence, our study introduces an innovative approach to the realm of LCP actuators, ushering in a new avenue for the design and fabrication of versatile and dynamically responsive LCP actuators.

Anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals synthesized by one&#8208;step mechanochemical method for high&#8208;efficiency photo&#8208;thermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation.

Abstract
An anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct organic mono&#8208;radical charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals for near&#8208;infrared photothermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Ionic compounds with halogen anions as the counterions serve as electron donors, providing the necessary electrons for efficient charge transfer with unchanged skeleton atoms and structures as well as the broad red&#8208;shifted absorption (200&#8211;2000&#8197;nm) and unprecedented photothermal conversion efficiency (~90.5&#8201;%@808&#8197;nm) for the cocrystals. Based on these cocrystals, an excellent solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation rate up to 6.1&#177;1.1&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;sun is recorded due to the comprehensive evaporation effect from the cocrystal loading in polyurethane foams and chimney addition, such performance is superior to the reported results on charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals or other materials for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation. This prototype exhibits the great potential of cocrystals prepared by the one&#8208;step mechanochemistry method in practical large&#8208;scale seawater desalination applications.

         <dc:description>Herein, we have synthesized multifunctionalized 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which are considered potential bioisosteres for meta&#8208;substituted arenes, through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with nitrones. This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.</dc:description>

Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable DNAzyme for the Sensitive Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids in biofluids are emerging biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics of diseases, but their clinical use has been hindered by the lack of sensitive detection assays. Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop&#8208;initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one&#8208;stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost&#8208;effective detection of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylphoshinylhydroxylamine (DPPH) Affords Late&#8208;Stage S&#8208;Imination To Access Free&#8208;NH Sulfilimines and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfilimines, as potential aza&#8208;isosteres of sulfoxides, are valued as building blocks, auxiliaries, ligands, bioconjugation handles, and as precursors to versatile S(VI) scaffolds including sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Here, we report a thioether imination methodology that exploits O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine (DPPH). Under mild, metal&#8208;free, and biomolecule&#8208;compatible conditions, DPPH enables late&#8208;stage S&#8208;imination on peptides, natural products, and a clinically trialled drug, and shows both excellent chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. This methodological report is extended to an efficient and high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot reaction for accessing free&#8208;NH sulfoximines with diverse substrates including ones of potential clinical importance. In the presence of a rhodium catalyst, sulfoxides are S&#8208;iminated in higher yields to afford free&#8208;NH sulfoximines. S&#8208;imination was validated on an oxidatively delicate amatoxin to give sulfilimine and sulfoximine congeners. Interestingly, these new sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;amatoxins show cytotoxicity. This is further extended to create sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;Fulvestrant and Buthionine analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two&#8208;dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three&#8208;dimensional (3D) h&#8208;BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize micron&#8208;sized 3D h&#8208;BN with a honeycomb&#8208;like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH3. Glucose facilitates the homogenous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO4 and BO3) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O2&#8208;B&#8208;N and O&#8208;B&#8208;N2 intermediates before finally being reduced to BN3 by NH3. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide&#8208;based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5 wt% of 3D h&#8208;BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300 h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 and retains 89 % of discharge capacity (138.9 mAh g&#8208;1) after 100 cycles at 1 C in the LFP//Li full cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulse&#160;Electrolysis Turns on CO2 Methanation through N&#8208;Confused Cupric Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breaking the D4h symmetry in the square&#8208;planar M&#8208;N4 configuration of macrocycle molecular catalysts has witnessed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, but at the expense of electrochemical stability. Herein, we hypothesize that the lability of the active Cu&#8208;N3 motifs in the N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CuNCP) could be overcome by applying pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE) during electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. We find that applying PPE can indeed enhance the CH4 selectivity on CuNCP by 3 folds to reach the partial current density of 170 mA cm&#8208;2 at &gt;60% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in flow cell. However, combined ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR), Raman, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterizations reveal that, in a prolonged time scale, the decomplexation of CuNCP is unavoidable, and the promoted water dissociation under high anodic bias with lowered pH and enriched protons facilitates successive hydrogenation of *CO on the irreversibly reduced Cu nanoparticles, leading to the improved CH4 selectivity. As a key note, this study signifies the adaption of electrolytic protocol to the catalyst structure for tailoring local chemical environment towards efficient CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Ion&#8208;Coordinated Bipolar Organodichalcogenide Cathodes Enabling High&#8208;Energy and Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high&#8208;energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high&#8208;voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion&#8208;coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe&#8208;SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)&#8208; to (PhSe&#8208;SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF&#8208;). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK&#8208;3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK&#8208;3||Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4 mAh gPDSe&#8208;1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4 V), high energy density (578.3 Wh kgPDSe&#8208;1), and ultralong lifespan (12 000 cycles) at 10 A g&#8208;1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion&#8208;type active site engineering for high&#8208;voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high&#8208;energy AZBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Ru Nanoparticles with Parasitic Ru&#8211;Co Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atoms Overcome the Volmer Step of Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for enhancing atomic efficiency and promoting the commercialization of fuel cells, but addressing the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media and achieving facile dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom site generation remains formidable challenges. Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles by embedding Co single atoms which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co1Ru1,n/rGO). In situ operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen&#8208;affine Co atom disrupts the symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles, resulting in parasitic Ru and Co dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom within Ru nanoparticles.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient dual-single-atom catalysts are crucial for enhancing atomic efficiency and promoting the commercialization of fuel cells, but addressing the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media and achieving facile dual-single-atom site generation remains formidable challenges. Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra-small Ru nanoparticles by embedding Co single atoms which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co1Ru1,n/rGO). In situ operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen-affine Co atom disrupts the symmetry of ultra-small Ru nanoparticles, resulting in parasitic Ru and Co dual-single-atom within Ru nanoparticles. The interaction between Ru single atoms and nanoparticles forms effective active centers. The parasitism of Co atoms modulates the adsorption of OH intermediates on Ru active sites, accelerating HOR kinetics through faster formation of *H2O. As anticipated, Co1Ru1,n/rGO exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (7.68 A mgRu-1) at 50 mV and exchange current density (0.68 mA cm-2), which are 6 and 7 times higher than those of Ru/rGO, respectively. Notably, it also displays exceptional durability surpassing that of commercial Pt catalysts.

         <title>Substantial Impact of Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Electrode Potential on the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Ru&#8208;CoP Urchin Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although great efforts on the delicate construction of a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) to modify the electronic properties of active sites have been conducted, the substantial impact of BIEF coupled with electrode potential on the electrochemical reactions has not been clearly investigated. Herein, we designed an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst composed of heterogeneous Ru&#8208;CoP urchin arrays on carbon cloth (Ru&#8208;CoP/CC) with a strong BIEF with the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Impressively, despite its unsatisfactory activity at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 (overpotential of 44 mV), Ru&#8208;CoP/CC exhibited better activity (357 mV) than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (505 mV) at 1 A cm&#8208;2. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low current densities. However, as the electrode potential became more negative (i.e., the current density increased), the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus greatly accelerating the whole alkaline HER process. This explains why the activity of Ru&#8208;CoP is relatively susceptible to the electrode potential compared to Pt/C.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions is a pressing demand for proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis. Manipulating proton character at the electrified interface, as the crux of all proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, is highly desirable but elusive. Herein we present a promising protocol, which reconstruct a connected hydrogen&#8208;bond network beween the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface by coupling hydrophilic units to boost acidic OER activity. Modelling on N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;layer clothed Mn&#8208;doped&#8208;Co3O4 (Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN), we unravel that the hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between CN units and H2O molecule not only drags the free water to enrich the surface of Mn&#8208;Co3O4 but also serves as a channel to promote the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the modulated local charge of the Co sites from CN units/Mn dopant lowers the OER barrier. Therefore, Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN surpasses RuO2 at high current density (100 mA cm&#8208;2 @ ~538 mV).</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;nuclearity Luminescent Lanthanide Nanocages for Tumor Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an unmet need for easy&#8208;to&#8208;visualize drug carriers that can deliver therapeutic cargoes deep into solid tumors. Herein, we report the preparation of ultrasmall luminescent imine&#8208;based lanthanide nanocages, Eu60 and Tb60 (collectively Ln60), designed to encapsulate anticancer chemotherapeutics for tumor therapy. The as&#8208;prepared nanocages possess large cavities suitable for the encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX), yielding DOX@Ln60 nanocages with diameters around 5 nm. DOX@Ln60 are efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing the cells to be visualized via the intrinsic luminescent property of Ln(III). Once internalized, the acidic intracellular microenvironment promotes imine bond cleavage and the release of the loaded DOX. DOX@Ln60 inhibits DNA replication and triggers tumor cell apoptosis. In a murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, DOX@Ln60 was found to inhibit tumor growth with negligible side effects on normal tissues. It proved more effective than various controls, including DOX and Ln60. The present nanocages thus point the way to the development of precise nanomedicines for tumor imaging and therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>The Reverse of Electrostatic Interaction Force for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy Al&#8208;Ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXenes with sufficient interlayer spacing are promising cathode materials for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), yet the electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8208;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8208; and is usually ignored. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge. By doping N and Co, the zeta potential is gradually transformed from negative (Ti3C2Tx) to near&#8208;neutral (Ti3CNTx), and finally positive (Ti3CNTx@Co). Therefore, the electrostatic repulsion force can be greatly weakened between Ti3CNTx and AlCl4&#8208;, or even formed a strong electrostatic attraction between Ti3CNTx@Co and AlCl4&#8208;, which can not only accommodate more AlCl4&#8208; ions in the Ti3CNTx@Co interlayers to increase the capacity, but also solve the stacking and expansion problems. As a result, the optimized Al&#8208;MXene battery exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of up to 240 mAh g&#8208;1 (2&#8208;4 times the capacity of graphite cathode, 60&#8208;120 mAh g&#8208;1) and a potential ultrahigh energy density (432 Wh kg&#8208;1, 2&#8208;4 times the value of graphite, 110&#8208;220 Wh kg&#8208;1) based on the mass of cathode materials, comparable to LiFePO4&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries (350&#8208;450 Wh kg&#8208;1, based on the mass of LiFePO4).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. One drawback of uncontrollable electrolyte degradation causes them to form a fragile and nonuniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI). In this study, we proposed a fluorinated carbon nanotube (CNT) macrofilm (CMF) on Li metal as a hybrid anode, which can regulate the redox state at anode/electrolyte interface. Due to the favorable reaction energy between plating Li and fluorinated CNTs, the metal can be fluorinated directly to a LiF&#8208;rich SEI during the charging process, leading to a high Young&#8217;s modulus (~2.0 GPa) and fast ionic transfer (~2.59&#215;10&#8211;7 S cm&#8211;1). The obtained SEI can guide the homogeneous plating/stripping of Li during electrochemical processes while suppressing dendrites growth. In particular, the hybrid endowed full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability allows for high&#8208;capacity retention (~99.3%) and remarkable rate capacity. This work can extend fluorination technology into a platform to control artificial SEI formation in Li&#8208;metal batteries giving it stability with long&#8208;life performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocatalytic Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we discuss how nanocatalysts specifically regulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the tumor microenvironment, and the key is to use unique components or redox status in solid tumors to initiate catalytic reactions for selective release of immune regulators at the tumor site. The biological mechanism of nanocatalytic reaction in regulating antitumor immunity was discussed in detail and the prospects were prospected.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR&#8208;T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy based on the durable catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side&#8208;effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on.

     alt="Nanocatalytic Anti-Tumor Immune Regulation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we discuss how nanocatalysts specifically regulate anti-tumor immunity through the tumor microenvironment, and the key is to use unique components or redox status in solid tumors to initiate catalytic reactions for selective release of immune regulators at the tumor site. The biological mechanism of nanocatalytic reaction in regulating antitumor immunity was discussed in detail and the prospects were prospected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR-T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy based on the durable catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side-effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune-regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune-response activations by nanocatalytic medicine-initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti-tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potential and broad prospects of nanocatalysis-based anti-tumor immune-therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte by Multivalent Low&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Penalty Design for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility in ester electrolytes and proposed a new multivalent low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design to achieve intrinsic LiNO3 solubilization. Linear esters with higher multivalency leads to more stable solvation structures and a monotonic increase in LiNO3 solubility of up to 0.8&#8197;M. Our findings offer new fundamental insights into the LiNO3 solvation chemistry.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a remarkable additive that can dramatically enhance the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at lithium metal anodes. However, it has long been constrained by its incompatibility with commercially used ester electrolytes. Herein, we correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility and proposed a new low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design that achieves high intrinsic LiNO3 solubility in ester solvents by employing multivalent linear esters. This strategy is conceptually different from the conventional enthalpic methods that relies on extrinsic high&#8208;polarity carriers. In this way, LiNO3 can directly interact with the primary ester solvents and fundamentally alters the electrolyte properties, resulting in substantial improvements in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. This work illustrates the significance of regulating the solvation entropy for high&#8208;performance electrolyte design.

         <title>Coupling Ferricyanide/Ferrocyanide Redox Mediated Recycling Spent LiFePO4 with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water electrolysis coupling spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox reaction realizes energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production at low electricity costs, while realizing spent LFP materials to value&#8208;added LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4 for cost&#8208;effective and environment&#8208;friendly recycling of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LFP batteries.







Abstract
Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable alternative oxidation reactions offers a promising alternative to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production. However, questions remain regarding the economic viability of alternative oxidation reactions for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Here, we propose an innovative cost&#8208;effective, environment&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;efficient strategy for simultaneous recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries and hydrogen production by coupling the spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) redox reaction. The onset potential for the electrooxidation of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; is low at 0.87&#8197;V. Operando Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy confirm that the presence of LFP in the electrolyte allows for the rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;, thereby completing the [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; redox cycle as well as facilitating the conversion of spent LiFePO4 into LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4. The electrolyzer consumes 3.6&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 43&#8201;% less than conventional water electrolysis. Additionally, this recycling pathway for spent LFP batteries not only minimizes chemical consumption and prevents secondary pollution but also presents significant economic benefits.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Guangnanmycin A Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant ring strain has to be built up in pursuit of guangnanmycin A, a congener of the anticancer drug lead leinamycin. The challenge was met by liaising ring closing alkyne metathesis with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization. The signature disulfide was introduced by a thia&#8208;Michael addition reaction followed by an unusual thioether&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide swap. In the dense array, however, final oxidation of the primary alcohol was unsuccessful.







Abstract
Guangnanmycin A is a recently discovered congener of the well&#8208;known antitumor drug lead leinamycin; its macrolactam ring, however, is even more strained than that of the parent compound. The first synthetic foray towards this challenging target is reported, which relies on molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed macrocyclization by ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) followed by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of the propargyl alcohol thus formed; the resulting enone enabled the introduction of the yet missing exo&#8208;methylene group by a modified Peterson olefination. The signature disulfide moiety of guangnanmycin A was installed by strain&#8208;driven thia&#8208;Michael addition followed by conversion of the thioether thus formed into an unsymmetric disulfide with the aid of (methylthio)dimethylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate and MeSSMe. While this sequence furnished racemic guangnanmycin A alcohol in good overall yield, the final oxidation to the corresponding acid failed, most likely because of the exceptional sensitivity of the strained scaffold.

         <title>Helitwistacenes&#8212;Combining Lateral and Longitudinal Helicity Results in Solvent&#8208;Induced Inversion of Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining helicenes with twistacenes, in which the extent of twisting can be tuned, has led to the new family of helitwistacenes. The combination of lateral and longitudinal helicity results in polarity&#8208;induced and twisting&#8208;induced sign inversion of both the electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals. This sign inversion could be explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.







Abstract
Helicity is expressed differently in ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;fused acenes&#8212;helicenes and twistacenes, respectively. While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes. While the X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent&#8208;induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8197;NMR and TD&#8208;DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.

         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the tandem BBr3&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of tertiary cyclic amine, intramolecular C&#8722;H borylation, and Ni&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular B&#8722;Br/C&#8722;Br reductive coupling was developed. This method represents a simple route to construct the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8722;H borylation, accessing the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.

         <title>Facile Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Crystallization Modulation for Large&#8208;area High&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br Films and Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrogen bonding&#8208;modulated crystallization strategy is developed to achieve highly&#8208;crystalline, uniform, and large&#8208;area CsPbI2Br films, enabling CsPbI2Br solar cells with record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under indoor illumination suggests its potential in the applications of powering the Internet of Things, etc.







Abstract
The thermally stable inorganic cesium&#8208;based perovskites promise efficient and stable photovoltaics. Unfortunately, the strong ionic bonds lead to uncontrollable rapid crystallization, making it difficult in fabricating large&#8208;area black&#8208;phase film for photovoltaics. Herein, we developed a facile hydrogen&#8208;bonding assisted strategy for modulating the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to achieve uniform large&#8208;area phase&#8208;pure films with much&#8208;reduced defects. The simple addition of methylamine acetate in precursors not only promotes the formation of intermediate phase via hydrogen bonding to circumvent the direct crystallization of CsPbI2Br from ionic precursors but also widens the film processing window, thus enabling to fabricate large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI2Br film under benign conditions. Combining with stable dopant&#8208;free poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), the CsPbI2Br solar cells achieve the record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The obtained high efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under 1000&#8197;lux illumination suggests its potential in indoor photovoltaics for powering the Internet of Things, etc.

         <title>Local Water Content in Polymer Gels Measured with Super&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous polymer systems play a key role in many applications and technological innovations. The fluorescence lifetime of a dye provides access to the number of water molecules in its vicinity, allowing the local water content of aqueous polymer networks to be studied with super&#8208;resolved fluorescence imaging. This method was applied to thermoresponsive microgels to study the water content in their swollen and collapsed state.







Abstract
Water molecules play an important role in the structure, function, and dynamics of (bio&#8208;)&#8201;materials. A direct access to the number of water molecules in nanoscopic volumes can thus give new molecular insights into materials and allow for fine&#8208;tuning their properties in sophisticated applications. The determination of the local water content has become possible by the finding that H2O quenches the fluorescence of red&#8208;emitting dyes. Since deuterated water, D2O, does not induce significant fluorescence quenching, fluorescence lifetime measurements performed in different H2O/D2O&#8208;ratios yield the local water concentration. We combined this effect with the recently developed fluorescence lifetime single molecule localization microscopy imaging (FL&#8208;SMLM) in order to nanoscopically determine the local water content in microgels, i.e. soft hydrogel particles consisting of a cross&#8208;linked polymer swollen in water. The change in water content of thermo&#8208;responsive microgels when changing from their swollen state at room temperature to a collapsed state at elevated temperature could be analyzed. A clear decrease in water content was found that was, to our surprise, rather uniform throughout the entire microgel volume. Only a slightly higher water content around the dye was found in the periphery with respect to the center of the swollen microgels.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules bearing chiral sulfur stereocenters exert a great impact on asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral drugs, and chiral materials. Compared with acyclic ones, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of thio&#8208;heterocycles has largely lagged behind due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Here we establish the first modular platform to access chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones via Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations of vinylethylene carbonates with sulfinylanilines. This protocol is featured by readily available starting materials, and high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. In particular, an unusual effect of a non&#8208;chiral supporting ligand on the diastereoselectivity was observed. Possible reaction mechanisms and stereocontrol models were proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Na+ Solvation Environment and Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases with Sn(OTf)2 Additive in Non&#8208;flammable Phosphate Electrolytes towards Safe and Efficient Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are promising for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, these batteries are plagued by safety concerns due to the highly flammable nature of conventional electrolytes. Although nonflammable electrolytes eliminate the risk of fire, they often result in compromised battery performance due to poor compatibility with sodium metal anode and sulfur cathode. Herein, we develop an additive of tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2) in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes to improve the cycling stability of RT Na&#8211;S batteries via modulating the Na+ solvation environment and interface chemistry. The additive reduces the Na+ desolvation energy and enhances the electrolyte stability. Moreover, it facilitates the construction of Na&#8211;Sn alloy&#8208;based anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). These interphases help to suppress the growth of Na dendrites and the dissolution/shuttling of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), resulting in improved reversible capacity. Specifically, the Na&#8211;S battery with the designed electrolyte boosts the capacity from 322 to 906 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1. This study provides valuable insights for the development of safe and high&#8208;performance electrolytes in RT Na&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr Cross&#8208;Interfacial Electron Bridges to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off for Superdurable Bifunctional Single Atom Oxygen Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Nevertheless, the insufficient long&#8208;term stability remains a widespread concern owing to the inevitable 2&#8208;electron byproducts, H2O2. Here, we construct Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr cross&#8208;interfacial electron bridges (CIEBs) via the interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates. Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs is synthesized by the molten salt template method, exhibiting dominant 4&#8208;electron selectively and extremely low H2O2 yield confirmed by Damjanovic kinetic analysis. The Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs demonstrates impressive bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (&#8710;E=0.70 V) and breakthrough durability including 100% current retention after 10 h continuous operation and cycling performance over 1500 h for Zn&#8208;air battery. The hybrid interfacial configuration and the understanding of the electronic coupling mechanism reported here could shed new light on the design of superdurable M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>PAM&#8208;Engineered Toehold Switches as Input&#8208;Responsive Activators of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The RNA&#8208;programmed CRISPR effector protein Cas12a has emerged as a powerful tool for gene editing and molecular diagnostics. However, additional bio&#8208;engineering strategies are required to achieve control over Cas12a activity. Here, we show that Toehold Switch DNA hairpins, presenting a rationally designed locked protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the loop, can be used to control Cas12a in response to molecular inputs. Reconfiguring the Toehold Switch DNA from a hairpin to a duplex conformation through a strand displacement reaction provides an effective means to modulate the accessibility of the PAM, thereby controlling the binding and cleavage activities of Cas12a. Through this approach, we showcase the potential to trigger downstream Cas12a activity by leveraging proximity&#8208;based strand displacement reactions in response to target binding. By utilizing the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a as a signal transduction method, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach for sensing applications. Our system enables rapid, one&#8208;pot detection of IgG antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity even within complex matrices. Besides the bioanalytical applications, the switchable PAM&#8208;engineered Toehold Switches serve as programmable tools capable of regulating Cas12a&#8208;based targeting and DNA processing in response to molecular inputs and hold promise for a wide array of biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Regulated Cathode with Low Strain and Constraint Phase&#8208;Change Toward Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Al&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During multivalent ions insertion processes, intense electrostatic interaction between charge carriers and host makes the high&#8208;performance reversible Al&#8208;ions storage remains an elusive target. On account of the strong electrostatic repulsion and poor robustness, metal organic frameworks, including Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs), severely suffers from the inevitable and large strain and phase change during reversible Al3+ insertion. Herein, we demonstrate an entropy&#8208;driven strategy to realize ultralong life aqueous Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) based on medium entropy PBAs (ME&#8208;PBAs) host. By virtue of multiple redox active centers introduction, the intrinsic poor conductivity and discharging voltage platform can be enhanced simultaneously, resulting in outstanding capabilities of electrochemical Al ions storage. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;occupation at metal sites in PBA frameworks can also increase the M&#8208;N bond intensity, which is beneficial for achieving the constrain on phase change during consecutive Al3+ reversible insertion, to realize an extended lifespan over 10,000 cycles. Based on the calculation at different operation states, the fluctuation of ME&#8208;PBA lattice parameters is varied in a range of only 1.2%. Assembled with MoO3 anodes, the full cells AIBs can also deliver outstanding electrochemical properties. The entropy regulation strategy uncover the isochronous constrain on both strain and phase transition for long&#8208;term reversible Al3+ storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Thiyl Radical Addition&#8722;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods that could directly control the thiyl radical propagation is highly desirable yet remains challenging in modern polymer chemistry. Here, we reported the first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy, which utilizes allyl sulfides as chain transfer agents for reversibly deactivating the propagating thiyl radicals, thus allowing us to directly control a challenging thiyl radical chain polymerization to afford polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures. A linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, high chain&#8208;end fidelity, and efficient chain extension proved good controllability of the polymerization. In addition, density functional theory calculations provided insight into the reversible deactivation ability of allyl sulfides. The SRAFT strategy developed in this work represents a promising platform for discovering new controlled polymerizations based on thiyl radical chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and Applications of D&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives&#8208;based Metabolic Labeling of Bacterial Peptidoglycan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidoglycan, an essential component within the cell walls of virtually all bacteria, is composed of glycan strands linked by stem peptides that contain D&#8208;amino acids. The peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery exhibits high tolerance to various D&#8208;amino acid derivatives. D&#8208;amino acid derivatives with different functionalities can thus be specifically incorporated into and label the peptidoglycan of bacteria, but not the host mammalian cells. This metabolic labeling strategy is highly selective, highly biocompatible, and broadly applicable, which has been utilized in various fields. This review introduces the metabolic labeling strategies of peptidoglycan by using D&#8208;amino acid derivatives, including one&#8208;step and two&#8208;step strategies. In addition, we emphasize the various applications of D&#8208;amino acid derivative&#8208;based metabolic labeling, including bacterial peptidoglycan visualization (existence, biosynthesis, and dynamics, etc.), bacterial visualization (including bacterial imaging and visualization of growth and division, metabolic activity, antibiotic susceptibility, etc.), pathogenic bacteria&#8208;targeted diagnostics and treatment (positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, gas therapy, immunotherapy, etc.), and live bacteria&#8208;based therapy. Finally, a summary of this metabolic labeling and an outlook is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolved Readers of 5&#8208;Carboxylcytosine&#160;CpG Dyads Reveal a High Versatility of the Methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;Binding Domain for Recognition of Noncanonical Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical cytosine 5&#8208;methylation (mC), a total of four different 5&#8208;modifications can theoretically co&#8208;exist in the two strands of a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers for individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions, it has been unclear whether a natural protein scaffold would allow selective recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically methylated CpGs. We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate readers of 5&#8208; carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;binding domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover highly selective, low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC&#8208; dyads. Together with mutational and modelling studies, our findings reveal a striking evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely abandon its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic reader design.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Truxene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Cages: Triple Interlocking and Supramolecular Chirogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating chiral elements in host&#8208;guest systems currently focuses much attention, which results from the major impact such structures may have onto a wide range of applications, from pharmaceuticals to materials science and beyond. Moreover, the development of multi&#8208;responsive and &#8208;functional systems is highly desirable since they offer numerous benefits. In this context, we describe herein the construction of a metal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled cage that associates a chiral truxene&#8208;based ligand and a bis&#8208;ruthenium complex. The maximum separation between both facing chiral units in the assembly is fixed by the intermetallic distance within the lateral bis&#8208;ruthenium complex (8.4 &#197;). The resulting chiral cavity was shown to encapsulate polyaromatic guest molecules, but also to afford a chiral triply interlocked [2]catenane structure. The formation of the latter occurs at high concentration, while its disassembly could be achieved by addition of a planar achiral molecule. Interestingly the latter exhibits induced circular dichroism signature when trapped within the chiral cavity, demonstrating the cage ability for inducing supramolecular chirogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Structure&#8722;Activity Relationship Towards CO2 Electroreduction over SnO2 by A Standard Research Paradigm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Authentic surface structures under reaction conditions determine the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, therefore, the knowledge of the structure&#8722;activity relationship can facilitate the design of efficient catalyst structures for specific reactivity requirements. However, understanding the relationship between a more realistic active surface and its performance is challenging due to the complicated interface microenvironment in electrocatalysis. Herein, we proposed a standard research paradigm to effectively decipher the structure&#8722;activity relationship in electrocatalysis, which is exemplified in the CO2 electroreduction over SnO2. The proposed practice has aided in discovering authentic/resting surface states (Sn layer) of SnO2 accountable for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance under electrocatalytic conditions, which then is corroborated in the subsequent CO2RR experiments over SnO2 with different morphologies (nanorods, nanoparticles, and nanosheets) in combination with in&#8722;situ characterizations. This proposed methodology is further extended to the SnO electrocatalysts, providing helpful insights into catalytic structures. It is believed that our proposed standard research paradigm is also applicable to other electrocatalytic systems, in the meantime, decreases the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and accelerates the design of catalyst structures that achieve sustainable performance for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Mining the Metabolic Capacity of Clostridium sporogenes Aided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anaerobes dominate the microbiota of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where a significant portion of small molecules can be degraded or modified. However, the enormous metabolic capacity of gut anaerobes remains largely elusive in contrast to aerobic bacteria, mainly due to the requirement of sophisticated laboratory settings. In this study, we employed an in&#8208;silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, to predict the metabolic capacity of a gut anaerobe, Clostridium sporogenes, against small molecules. Experiments revealed that among the top seven candidates predicted as unstable, six indeed exhibited instability in C. sporogenes culture. We further identified several metabolites resulting from the supplementation of everolimus in the bacterial culture for the first time. By utilizing bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays, we successfully identified an enzyme encoded in the genome of C. sporogenes responsible for everolimus transformation. Our framework thus can potentially facilitate future understanding of small molecules metabolism in the gut, further improve patient care through personalized medicine, and guide the development of new small molecule drugs and therapeutic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of stilbene pairs in a DNA duplex mediated by ruthenium photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of orthogonal photoresponsive systems for use in photochemistry, biochemistry and other fields has proven challenging. We herein report a method for site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of a DNA duplex. A stilbene pair was introduced into a DNA duplex and a ruthenium complex was conjugated with a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide. We demonstrated that [2+2] photocycloaddition of the stilbene pair occurred upon irradiation visible light when the ruthenium complex was in close proximity due to triplex formation. No reaction occurred when the ruthenium complex was not in proximity to the stilbene pair. The wavelength of visible light used was of lower energy than the wavelength of UV light necessary for direct excitation of stilbene. Quantum chemical calculation indicated that ruthenium complex catalyzed the photocycloaddition via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site selectivity of this photo&#8208;crosslinking system was evaluated using a DNA duplex bearing two stilbene pairs as a substrate; we showed that the site of crosslinking was precisely regulated by the sequence of the oligonucleotide linked to the ruthenium complex. Since this method does not require orthogonal photoresponsive molecules, it will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable PROTACs for&#160;Reversible and Spatiotemporal Regulation of NAMPT and NAD+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) serves as an essential coenzyme for DNA synthesis and has diverse biological functions. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in mammals. Herein, the first chemical tool for optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems was developed using the photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PS&#8208;PROTACs) strategy. NAMPT activator and dimethylpyrazolazobenzene photoswitch was innovatively used to design highly efficient PS&#8208;PROTACs, enabling up&#8208; and down&#8208; reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+ in a light&#8208;dependent manner and reduced the toxicity associated with inhibitor&#8208;based PS&#8208;PROTACs. Interestingly, the PS&#8208;PROTAC could be activated under the 620 nm irradiation, realizing in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT and NAD+.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Aziridines with Vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Vinyl Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azetidines, being four&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value&#8208;added 2&#8208;alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step&#8208;economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Azetidines, being four-membered N-heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh-catalyzed one-carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl-N-triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value-added 2-alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one-pot two-step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step-economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds. The pivotal aspect of this successful transformation lies in the in-situ formation of an alkenyl aziridinium ylide intermediate. Experimental investigations, coupled with computational studies, suggest that a diradical pathway is involved in the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Functional Small Molecules into Nanoparticles: Assembly&#160;and Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules, including therapeutic drugs and tracer molecules, play a vital role in biological processing, disease treatment and diagnosis, and have inspired various nanobiotechnology approaches to realize their biological function, particularly in drug delivery. Desirable features of a delivery system for functional small molecules (FSMs) include high biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and simple manufacturing processes, without the need for chemical modification of the FSM itself. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and versatile approach, based on metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly, for assembling FSMs into nanoparticles (i.e., FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under aqueous and ambient conditions. We demonstrate loading of anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores at up to ~80% that is mostly facilitated by &#960; and hydrophobic interactions between the FSM and nanoparticle components. Secondary nanoparticle engineering involving coating with a polyphenol&#8211;antibody thin film or sequential co&#8208;loading of multiple FSMs enables cancer cell targeting and combination delivery, respectively. Incorporating fluorophores into FSM&#8208;MPN NPs enables the visualization of biodistribution at different time points, revealing that most of these NPs are retained in the kidney and heart 24 h post intravenous administration. This work provides a viable pathway for the rational design of small molecule nanoparticle delivery platforms for diverse biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Review and Theoretical Analysis of Fluorinated Radicals in Direct CAr&#8211;H Functionalization of (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We highlight key contributions in the field of direct radical CAr&#8211;H (hetero)aromatic functionalization involving fluorinated radicals. A compilation of Functional Group Transfer Reagents and their diverse activation mechanisms leading to the release of radicals are discussed. The substrate scope for each radical is analyzed and classified into three categories according to the electronic properties of the substrates. Density functional theory computational analysis provides insights into the chemical reactivity of several fluorinated radicals through their electrophilicity and nucleophilicity parameters. Theoretical analysis of their reduction potentials also highlights the remarkable correlation between electrophilicity and oxidizing ability. It is also established that highly fluorinated radicals (e.g.&#8226;OCF3) are capable of engaging in single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes rather than radical addition, which is in good agreement with experimental literature data. A reactivity scale, based on activation barrier of addition of these radicals to benzene is also elaborated using the high accuracy DLPNO&#8208;(U)CCSD(T) method.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Specific Dual Modification of Peptides through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific introduction of multiple components into peptides is greatly needed for the preparation of densely functionalized and structurally uniform peptides. In this regard, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific peptide modification is attractive, but it can be difficult due to the presence of highly nucleophilic lysine &#949;&#8208;amine. In this work, we developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of iminopeptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#949;&#8208;amine, thus affording the cycloadducts in excellent yields. Tolerating a broad range of functional groups and molecules, the present method provides the opportunity to rapidly construct doubly functionalized peptides using readily accessible aldehyde and maleimide modules.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Degradable Oxygen&#8208;Rich Polymers with AB/ABB Units from Fast and Selective Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Researchers have been chasing plastics that can automatically and fully degrade into valuable products under natural conditions. Here, we develop a series of water&#8208;degradable polymers from the first reported fast and selective cationic copolymerization of formaldehyde (B) with cyclic anhydrides (A). In addition to readily accessible monomers, the method is performed at industrially relevant temperatures (~100 &#176;C), takes tens or even minutes, and uses common acid as the catalyst. Interestingly, such polymers possess tunable AB/ABB&#8208;type repeating units, which are considered to be thermodynamic and kinetic products, respectively, resulting in low carbon content ([O]:[C] up to 1:1). Notably, the polymers can completely degrade to valuable diacids within 150 days in water at ambient temperature owing to the incorporation of carboxyl terminals and acid&#8208;responsive acetal units. By washing with aqueous sodium carbonate, the polymers are relatively stable over several months.</dc:description>

The chiral CpxRh(III) catalysis system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance and wide functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 93% ee). This protocol presents a novel and effective strategy for synthesizing enantioenriched aziridines from simple alkenes.

This protocol features excellent functional group tolerance, heterocyclic compatibility, and high deuterium incorporation levels.

         <title>Dual Stimuli&#8208;Responsive [2]Rotaxanes with Tunable Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission and Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the construction of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent system with precisely tunable emissions, the typical&#160;9,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,14&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a, c]phenazine (DPAC)&#160;luminogen&#160;with attractive vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) behavior has been introduced into [2]rotaxane as a stopper. Taking advantage of their unique dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness towards&#160;solvent and anion, the resultant [2]rotaxanes reveal both tunable VIE and switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Attributed to the formation of mechanical bonds, DPAC&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxanes display interesting VIE behaviors including white&#8208;light emission upon the addition of viscous solvent, as evaluated in detail by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aiming at the construction of novel stimuli-responsive fluorescent system with precisely tunable emissions, the typical&#160;9,14-diphenyl-9,14-dihydrodibenzo[a, c]phenazine (DPAC)&#160;luminogen&#160;with attractive vibration-induced emission (VIE) behavior has been introduced into [2]rotaxane as a stopper. Taking advantage of their unique dual stimuli-responsiveness towards&#160;solvent and anion, the resultant [2]rotaxanes reveal both tunable VIE and switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Attributed to the formation of mechanical bonds, DPAC-functionalized [2]rotaxanes display interesting VIE behaviors including white-light emission upon the addition of viscous solvent, as evaluated in detail by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra. In addition, ascribed to the regulation of chirality information transmission through anion-induced motions of chiral wheel, the resolved chiral [2]rotaxanes reveal unique switchable CPL upon the addition of anion, leading to significant increase in the dissymmetry factors (glum) values with excellent reversibility. Interestingly, upon doping the chiral [2]rotaxanes in stretchable polymer, the blend films reveal remarkable emission change from white light to light blue with significant 6.5-fold increase in glum values up to -0.035 under external tensile stresses.

         <title>Selective C&#8208;H Halogenation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) possesses both flavin reductase and FDH activity in a single enzyme. We recently reported that the single component FDH AetF catalyzes site&#8208;selective bromination and iodination of a variety of aromatic substrates and enantioselective bromolactonization and iodoetherification of styrenes bearing pendant carboxylic acid or alcohol substituents. Given this inherent reactivity and selectivity, we explored the utility of AetF as catalyst for alkene and alkyne C&#8208;H halogenation. We find that AetF catalyzes halogenation of a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity.&#160;Despite the utility of haloalkenes for cross&#8208;coupling and other applications, accessing these compounds in a stereoselective manner typically requires functional group interconversion processes, and selective halogenation of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted olefins remains rare.&#160;We also establish that AetF and homologues of this enzyme can halogenate terminal alkynes. Mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects are used to support a mechanistic proposal involving covalent catalysis for halogenation of unactivated alkynes by AetF homologues. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis and continue to show the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Salts: Their Porous Network Diversification and Construction of Chiral Helical Luminescent Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic salts (POSs) are organic porous materials assembled via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between strong acids and bases such as sulfonic acids and amines. To diversify the network topology of POSs and extend its functions, this study focused on using 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(9,9'&#8208;spirobi[fluorene]&#8208;2,2',7,7'&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzenesulfonic acid (spiroBPS), which is a tetrasulfonic acid comprising a square planar skeleton. The POS consisting of spiroBPS and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) (spiroBPS/TPMA) was constructed from the two&#8208;fold interpenetration of an orthogonal network with pts topology, which has not been reported in conventional POSs, owing to the shape of the spirobifluorene backbone. Furthermore, combining tris(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Cl) and tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Br), which are bulkier than TPMA owing to the introduction of halogens at the p&#8208;position of the phenyl groups with spiroBPS allows us to construct novel POSs (spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl and spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Br). These POSs were constructed from a chiral helical network with pth topology, which was induced by the steric hindrance between the halogens and the curved fluorene skeleton. Moreover, spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl with pth topology exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state, which has not been reported in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Species Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) thin films are obtained by reconstructing perovskite surface with GASCN/NaSCN. This surface reconstruction can repair surface defects of PNC, maintain the integrity of crystal structure, and suppress F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, thus enabling highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) solution has exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the luminance would be severely quenched when the PNC solution is assembled into thin films due to the agglomeration and fusion of NCs caused by the exfoliation of surface ligands and non&#8208;radiative F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from small to large particle sizes, which seriously affected the performances of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we used Guanidine thiocyanate (GASCN) and Sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) to achieve effective CsPbI3 PNC surface reconstruction. Due to the strong coordination ability of these small molecules with the anions and cations on the surface of the PNCs, they can provide strong surface protection against PNC fusion during centrifugal purification process and repair the surface defects of PNCs, so that the original uniform size distribution of PNCs can be maintained and FRET between close&#8208;packed PNC films is effectively suppressed, which allows the emission characteristics of the films to be preserved. As a result, highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free high&#8208;quality PNC thin films are obtained, with PLQY as high as 95.1&#8201;%, far exceeding that of the original film, and corresponding LEDs exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>Biocatalytic oxidations are an emerging technology for selective C&#8208;H bond activation. While promising for a range of selective oxidations, practical use of enzymes catalyzing aerobic hydroxylation is presently limited by their substrate scope and stability under industrially relevant conditions. Here, we report the engineering and practical application of a non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase for the direct stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroxylation of a non&#8208;native fluoroindanone en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan, replacing a five&#8208;step chemical synthesis with a direct enantioselective hydroxylation. Mechanistic studies indicated that formation of the desired product was limited by enzyme stability and product overoxidation, with these properties subsequently improved by directed evolution, yielding a biocatalyst capable of &gt;15,000 total turnovers. Highlighting the industrial utility of this biocatalyst, the high&#8208;yielding, green, and efficient oxidation was demonstrated at kilogram scale for the synthesis of belzutifan.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Crystallinity Mismatch Between Donor and Acceptor to Improve Exciton/Charge Transport in Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor has been proposed by incorporating a novel liquid crystal small molecule, BDTPF4&#8208;C6, which balances charge transport and suppresses charge recombination in organic solar cells. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was firstly observed between guest molecule and host donor and acceptor, resulting in increased charge generation in ternary blend.







Abstract
Achieving a more balanced charge transport by morphological control is crucial in reducing bimolecular and trap&#8208;assisted recombination and enhancing the critical parameters for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Hence, a facile strategy is proposed to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor by incorporating a novel multifunctional liquid crystal small molecule (LCSM) BDTPF4&#8208;C6 into the binary blend. BDTPF4&#8208;C6 is the first LCSM based on a tetrafluorobenzene unit and features a low liquid crystal phase transition temperature and strong self&#8208;assembly ability, conducive to regulating the active layer morphology. When BDTPF4&#8208;C6 is introduced as a guest molecule into the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 binary, it exhibits better compatibility with the donor PM6 and primarily resides within the PM6 phase because of the similarity&#8208;intermiscibility principle. Moreover, systematic studies revealed that BDTPF4&#8208;C6 could be used as a seeding agent for PM6 to enhance its crystallinity, thereby forming a more balanced and favourable charge transport with suppressed charge recombination. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was observed between the guest molecule and the host donor and acceptor, resulting in an improved current density. This study demonstrates a facile approach to balance the charge mobilities and offers new insights into boosting the efficiency of single&#8208;junction OSCs beyond 20&#8201;%.

BDTPF4-C6 is the first LCSM based on a tetrafluorobenzene unit and features a low liquid crystal phase transition temperature and strong self-assembly ability, conducive to regulating the active layer morphology. When BDTPF4-C6 is introduced as a guest molecule into the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 binary, it exhibits better compatibility with the donor PM6 and primarily resides within the PM6 phase because of the similarity-intermiscibility principle. Moreover, systematic studies revealed that BDTPF4-C6 could be used as a seeding agent for PM6 to enhance its crystallinity, thereby forming a more balanced and favourable charge transport with suppressed charge recombination. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was observed between the guest molecule and the host donor and acceptor, resulting in an improved current density. This study demonstrates a facile approach to balance the charge mobilities and offers new insights into boosting the efficiency of single-junction OSCs beyond 20&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gigantic transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated polyoxometalate cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers was obtained and used for enhanced brain&#8208;targeted glioma therapy for the first time.







Abstract
Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0&#8197;nm &#215; 6.0&#8197;nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate the apoptosis pathway of glioma cells with a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66&#8197;&#956;M). As the first brain&#8208;targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Tuning the Mechanical Properties of 3D&#8208;printed Objects by the RAFT Process: From Chain&#8208;Growth to Step&#8208;Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of xanthate&#8208;based RAFT agent and vinyl acetate&#8208;based monomer was developed and applied in photoinduced 3D printing, presenting a facile way to tune the mechanical properties of the printed objects.







Abstract
Photoinduced 3D printing based on the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process has emerged as a robust method for creating diverse functional materials. However, achieving precise control over the mechanical properties of these printed objects remains a critical challenge for practical application. Here, we demonstrated a RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of a bifunctional xanthate and bifunctional vinyl acetate. Additionally, we demonstrated photoinduced 3D printing through RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization with a tetrafunctional xanthate and a bifunctional vinyl acetate. By adjusting the molar ratio of the components in the printing resins, we finely tuned the polymerization mechanism from step&#8208;growth to chain&#8208;growth. This adjustment resulted in a remarkable range of tunable Young's moduli, ranging from 7.6&#8197;MPa to 997.1&#8197;MPa. Moreover, post&#8208;functionalization and polymer welding of the printed objects with varying mechanical properties opens up a promising way to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with specific and tunable properties.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Epoxidation of Alkenes with Near 100&#8201;% Conversion Rate and Selectivity by Regulating Lattice Chlorine Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice Cl&#8722; cyclic process of Co2(OH)3Cl was demonstrated to facilitate photoelectrochemical Cl&#8722; oxidative Cl2 generation in a salt electrolyte. The on&#8208;site produced HClO, by reacting Cl2 with H2O, can be a mediator to oxidize various alkenes to generate the corresponding epoxides with conversion ratios and selectivities of almost 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Directional organic transformation via a green, sustainable catalytic reaction has attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo&#8208;generated charge, where the lattice Cl&#8722; of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo&#8208;generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and be spontaneously recovered by Cl&#8722; of a salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water&#8208;soluble alkenes, including 4&#8208;vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid sodium, and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol can be epoxidized with near 100&#8201;% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl&#8722;MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120&#8197;hours. This work opens an avenue for solar&#8208;driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on&#8208;site reaction around the abundant ocean.

         <title>Massive Molecular Motion in Crystal Leads to an Unexpected Helical Covalent Polymer in a Solid&#8208;state Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactions are attractive due to their greener reaction conditions, and ability to yield unique products. Such reactions are feasible when the reacting groups are pre&#8208;organized in the crystal. We present a crystal that avoids a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement but reacts after a massive molecular motion leading to an unexpected product. This alerts that one has to be cautious in predicting the topochemical reactions based on crystal packing.







Abstract
We designed a proline&#8208;derived monomer with azide and alkene functional groups to enable topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization. In its crystal, the monomer forms supramolecular helices along the &#8216;a&#8217; axis through various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Along the &#8216;c&#8217; axis, the molecules arrange themselves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail in a wave&#8208;like pattern, positioning the azide and alkene groups of adjacent molecules in close proximity and anti&#8208;parallel orientation, complying with Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reaction. This prearranged configuration was expected to facilitate smooth topochemical polymerization, resulting in a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. Upon heating, the monomer underwent TEAC polymerization in a remarkable single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, but, to our surprise, it yielded an unexpected covalent helical polymer linked by 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline units. Remarkably, the crystal avoids the ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement for polymerization, but connects monomer molecules within the supramolecular helix through the cycloaddition of azide and alkene groups, even though they are not in close proximity nor in the expected orientation. This unexpected path, involving a substantial 134&#176; rotation of the alkene group, yields hitherto unknown 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline product regiospecifically. This study serves as a cautionary reminder that relying solely on topochemical postulates for predicting reactivity can sometimes be misleading.

         <title>Sulfonated Perylene as Three&#8208;in&#8208;One STING Agonist for Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study states that sulfonated perylene can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist that not only promotes the production of endogenous cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) but also inhibits its hydrolysis as well as achieves lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and hence presents an innovative platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) has been considered as a powerful immunotherapy strategy. While promising, the clinical translation of CDNs is still overwhelmed by its limited biostability and the resulting systemic immunotoxicity. Being differentiating from current application of exogenous CDNs to address these challenges, we herein developed one perylene STING agonist PDIC&#8208;NS, which not only promotes the production of endogenous CDNs but also inhibits its hydrolysis. More significantly, PDIC&#8208;NS can well reach lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and thus mitigates the systemic immunotoxicity upon intravenous administration. As a result, PDIC&#8208;NS had realized remarkable in vivo antitumor activity, and backward verified on STING knock out mice. Overall, this study states that PDIC&#8208;NS can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecule STING agonist characterized by promoting the content and biostability of endogenous CDNs as well as possessing good tissue specificity, and hence presents an innovative strategy and platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Polar Perovskites for Highly Sensitive Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polar perovskite MhyPbBr3 (Mhy=methylhydrazine), combining the merits of the excellent charge transition and bulk photovoltage effect, realized a sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection with a high sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The work first reports the unprecedented radiation photovoltage and efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D classic organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, shedding light on future practical applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have achieved tremendous success in direct X&#8208;ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport. However, owing to the centrosymmetry of classic 3D structures, these reported X&#8208;ray detectors mostly require external electrical fields to run, resulting in bulky overall circuitry, high energy consumption, and operational instability. Herein, we first report the unprecedented radiation photovoltage in 3D OIHP for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, the 3D polar OIHP MhyPbBr3 (1, Mhy=methylhydrazine) shows an intrinsic radiation photovoltage (0.47&#8197;V) and large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (1.1&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, these excellent physical characteristics endow 1 with sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection performance, showing a considerable sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which surpasses those of most self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detectors. This work first explores highly sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D polar OIHPs, shedding light on future practical applications.

         <title>Leveraging Expertise in Thermal Catalysis to Understand Plasma Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Scientific Perspective outlines best practice in the design of plasma catalysis experiments. A water pumping model depicts the limitations of an exergonic reaction that surpasses thermodynamic equilibrium, where the pump represents the plasma. The leak back causes energy dissipation, depending on the water level in the upper reservoir (representing conversion) and the size of the leak (representing plasma activation of the product).







Abstract
Best practices in testing heterogeneous catalysts are translated to plasma&#8208;catalytic experiments. Independent determination of plasma&#8208;catalytic and plasma&#8208;chemical contributions is essential. Non&#8208;porous catalyst particles are preferred because active sites inside sub&#8208;micron pores cannot contribute. Temperature variation is needed to determine kinetics, despite the complexity of thermal effects in plasma. Rigorous checks on catalyst deactivation and mass balance are needed. Plasma enhanced reversed reactions should be minimized by keeping conversion low and far from thermodynamic equilibrium, preventing underestimation of the rate of forward reaction. In contrast, plasma&#8208;catalytic studies often aim at conversions surpassing thermodynamic equilibrium, not obtaining any information on kinetics. Calculation of catalyst activity per active sites (turn&#8208;over&#8208;frequency) requires also appropriate characterization to determine the number of active sites.The relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics for plasma&#8208;catalysis is discussed using endothermic decomposition of CO2 and exothermic synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2 as examples. Assuming Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood and Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanisms, the effect of excitation of reactant molecules on activation barriers and surface coverages are discussed, influencing reaction rates. The consequences of reversed reactions are considered. Plasma&#8208;catalysis with catalysts applied for thermal catalysis at much higher temperature should be avoided, as adsorbed species are bonded too strongly resulting in low rates.

         <title>Nitrogenous Intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly evolving field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalysis encompasses various processes, ranging from green NH3 synthesis and the construction of C&#8722;N bonds with small molecules to the synthesis of nitrogenous compounds with unconventional oxidation states. The review aims to provide insights into recent progress, research methodologies, and prospective avenues for the regulated generation and in situ utilization of nitrogenous intermediates.







Abstract
Chemical manufacturing utilizing renewable sources and energy emerges as a promising path towards sustainability and carbon neutrality. The electrocatalytic reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) offered a potential strategy for synthesizing various nitrogenous chemicals. However, it is currently hindered by low selectivity/efficiency and limited reaction pathways, mainly due to the difficulties in controllable generation and utilization of nitrogenous intermediates. In this minireview, focusing on nitrogenous intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions, we discuss newly developed methodologies for studying and controlling the generation, conversion, and utilizing of nitrogenous intermediates, which enable recent developments in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions that yield various products, including ammonia (NH3), organonitrogen molecules, and nitrogenous compounds exhibiting unconventional oxidation states. Furthermore, we also make an outlook to highlight future directions in the emerging field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Enhanced Directed Evolution in Mammalian Cells Yields a Hyperefficient Pyrrolysyl tRNA for Noncanonical Amino Acid Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. Using an optimized virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution Scheme in mammalian cells, an enhanced variant of the M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA, PyOtR, was developed. PyOtR enabled improved incorporation of many noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins expressed in mammalian cells, and enabled facile generation of cell lines stably expressing the ncAA incorporation machinery.







Abstract
Heterologous tRNAs used for noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells typically show poor activity. We recently introduced a virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution strategy (VADER) that can enrich improved tRNA mutants from na&#239;ve libraries in mammalian cells. However, VADER was limited to processing only a few thousand mutants; the inability to screen a larger sequence space precluded the identification of highly active variants with distal synergistic mutations. Here, we report VADER2.0, which can process significantly larger mutant libraries. It also employs a novel library design, which maintains base&#8208;pairing between distant residues in the stem regions, allowing us to pack a higher density of functional mutants within a fixed sequence space. VADER2.0 enabled simultaneous engineering of the entire acceptor stem of M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA (tRNAPyl), leading to a remarkably improved variant, which facilitates more efficient incorporation of a wider range of ncAAs, and enables facile development of viral vectors and stable cell&#8208;lines for ncAA mutagenesis.

         <dc:description>Making oppositely charged metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) into a tightly ordered structure may bring interesting functions. Herein, we report a novel structure composed of anionic (Zr4L6)8&#8722; (L=embonate) tetrahedral cages and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed cationic [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ (Bim=[BH(im)3]&#8722;; im=imidazole) cubic cages. Chiral transfer is observed from enantiopure (Zr4L6)8&#8722; cage to enantiopure [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ cage. A pair of enantiomers (PTC&#8208;373(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;373(&#923;)) are formed. PTC&#8208;373 exhibits high chemical and thermal stabilities, affording an interesting single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. More importantly, the combination of ionic pair cages significantly enhances its third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property, and its thin&#8208;film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platform Approach to Cleavable Macrocycles for the Controlled Disassembly of Mechanically Caged Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by interlocked oligonucleotides, peptides and knotted proteins, synthetic systems where a macrocycle cages a bioactive species that is &#8220;switched on&#8221; by breaking the mechanical bond have been reported. However, to date, each example uses a bespoke chemical design. Here we present a platform approach to mechanically caged structures wherein a single macrocycle precursor is diversified at a late stage to include a range of trigger units that control ring opening in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable to other classes of macrocycles suitable for rotaxane and catenane formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric with Afterglow Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent ferroelectrics are holding exciting prospect for integrated photoelectronic devices due to potential light&#8208;polarization interactions at electron scale. Integrating ferroelectricity and long&#8208;lived afterglow emission in a single material would offer new possibilities for fundamental research and applications, however, related reports have been a blank to date. For the first time, we here achieved the combination of notable ferroelectricity and afterglow emission in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material. Remarkably, the presented (4&#8208;methylpiperidium)CdCl3 also shows noticeable antiferroelectric behavior. The implementation of cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enables a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 114.4 K but also brings a record longest emission lifetime up to 117.11 ms under ambient conditions, realizing a leapfrog improvement of at least two orders of magnitude compared to reported hybrid ferroelectrics so far. This finding would herald the emergence of novel application potential, such as multi&#8208;level density data storage or multifunctional sensors, towards the future integrated optoelectronic devices with multitasking capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8211;SCF3 Coupling of Carbon&#8208;Centered Benzyl Radicals with (Me4N)SCF3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast with the well&#8208;established C(sp2)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling to forge the Ar&#8722;SCF3 bond, the corresponding enantioselective coupling of readily available alkyl&#160;electrophiles to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 bond has remained largely unexplored. We herein disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8211;SCF3 coupling of a range of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands through tuning electronic and steric effects for the simultaneous control of the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity. This strategy can successfully realize two types of asymmetric radical reactions, including enantioconvergent C(sp3)&#8211;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling of racemic benzyl&#160;halides and three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;carbotrifluoromethylthiolation of arylated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. It therefore provides a highly flexible platform for the rapid assembly of an array of enantioenriched SCF3&#8208;containing molecules of interest in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Acetonaphthones, which bear an alkenyl group tethered to its C1 carbon atom via an oxygen atom, were found to undergo an enantioselective, intramolecular ortho photocycloaddition reaction. A chiral oxazaborolidine Lewis acid leads to a bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate and enables an efficient enantioface differen&#173;tiation. Visible light irradiation (&#955; = 450 nm) triggers the reaction which is tolerant of various groups at almost any position except carbon atom C8 (16 examples, 53&#8208;99% yield, 80&#8208;97% ee). Consecutive reactions were explored including a sensitized rearrangement to tetra&#173;hydrobiphenylenes, which occurred with full retention of configuration. Evidence was collected that the catalytic photocycloaddition occurs via triplet intermediates, and the binding mode of the acetonaphthone to the chiral Lewis acid was elucidated by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Boron Scan of Ethyl Acetoacetate Leads to Versatile Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry, including its pedagogy and applications. In this study, we present borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. A boron handle has been installed at either [[EQUATION]]&#8208; or [[EQUATION]]&#8208;position of acetoacetate by homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates. Either alkyl or boryl groups were found to migrate with regiochemistry being a function of the steric bulk of the diazo species. Boryl [[EQUATION]]&#8208;ketoesters can be further modified into borylated pyrazolones and oximes, thereby expanding the synthetic toolkit and offering opportunities for additional modifications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry, including its pedagogy and applications. In this study, we present borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. A boron handle has been installed at either [[EQUATION]]- or [[EQUATION]]-position of acetoacetate by homologation of acyl-MIDA (N-methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates. Either alkyl or boryl groups were found to migrate with regiochemistry being a function of the steric bulk of the diazo species. Boryl [[EQUATION]]-ketoesters can be further modified into borylated pyrazolones and oximes, thereby expanding the synthetic toolkit and offering opportunities for additional modifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dopants Induce Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Triarylamine Boronate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic materials exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising candidates for oxygen sensors and information encryption owing to their cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly nature. Herein, we report a bimolecular RTP system where DTBU acts as the guest and TBBU serves as the host. In contrast to previously reported results, we find that both pure DTBU and TBBU do not exhibit RTP in the solid state even under N2 atmosphere. A DTBU/TBBU system with a low doping ratio (0.1 mol%) exhibits persistent yellowish&#8208;green afterglow with a lifetime of 340 ms and is highly sensitive to oxygen. A DTBU/TBBU system with a higher doping ratio (10 mol%) maintains a phosphorescence lifetime of 179 ms under air. Applications of DTBU/TBBU at varied doping ratios in both oxygen sensing and information encryption are demonstrated. We propose that the T1 state of TBBU acts as an energy transfer intermediate between Tn and T1 of DTBU, ultimately leading to the generation of persistent RTP. Overall, this work demonstrates the critical importance of material purity in the design of RTP systems, and how an understanding of host&#8208;guest doping enables their photophysical properties to be precisely tuned.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Radical Cascade to a Chiral Saddle&#8208;Shaped Peropyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of open&#8208;shell molecular graphene fragments are typically thought of as undesired decomposition processes because they lead to the loss of desired features like &#960;&#8208;magnetism. Oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene shows, however, that these transformations hold promise as a synthetic tool for making complex structures via formation of multiple bonds and rings in a single step. Here, we explore the feasibility of using this &#8220;undesired&#8221; reaction of phenalenyl to build up strain and provide access to non&#8208;planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To this end, we designed and synthesized a biradical system with two phenalenyl units linked via a biphenylene backbone. The design facilitates an intramolecular cascade reaction to a helically twisted saddle&#8208;shaped product, where the key transformations&#8212;ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;fusion&#8212;occur within one reaction. The negative curvature of the final peropyrene product, induced by the formed eight&#8208;membered ring, was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the helical twist was validated via resolution of the product&#8217;s enantiomers that display circularly polarized luminescence and high configurational stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homochiral Tetrahedral Cage Comprising Only Achiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How Nature synthesizes enantiomerically pure substances from achiral or racemic resources remains a mystery. Here, we aimed to emulate this natural phenomenon by constructing chiral tetrahedral cages through self&#8208;assembly, achieved by condensing two achiral compounds &#8212; a trisamine and a trisaldehyde. The occurrence of intercomponent CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions within the cage frameworks results in twisted conformations, imparting planar chirality to tetrahedrons. In instances where the trisaldehyde precursor features electron&#8208;withdrawing ester side chains, we observed that the intermolecular CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; forces are strong enough to prevent racemization. To attain enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, a chiral amine was introduced during the imine formation process. The addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde precursor formed a trisimino intermediate. This chiral compound was subsequently combined with the achiral trisamino precursor, leading to an imine exchange reaction that releasing the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 75%, exclusively composed of achiral building blocks. Moreover, since the chiral amine was not consumed during the imine exchange cycle, it enabled the enantioselective self&#8208;assembly of the tetrahedral cage for multiple cycles when new batches of the achiral trisaldehyde and trisamino precursors were successively added.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potentiometric Dual&#8208;Channel Microsensor Reveals that Fluctuation of H2S is Less pH&#8208;Dependent During Spreading Depolarization in the Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spreading depolarization (SD) is one of the most common neuropathologic phenomena in the nervous system, relating to numerous diseases.  However, real&#8208;time monitoring the rapid chemical changes during SD to probe the molecular mechanism remains a great challenge. We develop a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous monitoring of H2S and pH featuring excellent selectivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Using this microsensor we firstobserve real time changes of H2S and pH in the rat brain induced by SD. This changes of H2S are completely suppressed when the rat pre&#8208;treats with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a blocker to inhibit the H2S&#8208;producing enzyme, indicating H2S fluctuation might be related to enzyme&#8208;dependent pathway during SD and less pH&#8208;dependent. This study provides a new perspective for studying the function of H2S and the molecular basis of SD&#8208;associated diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics Controlled Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have recently developed rapidly compared to crystalline silicon solar cells. To have an effective way to control the crystallization of perovskite thin films is the key for achieving good device performance. However, a paradox in perovskite crystallization is from the mismatch between nucleation and Oswald ripening. Usually, the large numbers of nucleation sites tend to weak Oswald ripening. Here, we proposed a new mechanism to promote the formation of nucleation sites by reducing surface energy from 44.9 mN/m to 36.1 mN/m, to spontaneously accelerate the later Oswald ripening process by improving the grain solubility through the elastic modulus regulation. The ripening rate is increased from 2.37 &#197;m&#183;s&#8208;1 to 4.61 &#197;m&#183;s&#8208;1 during annealing. Finally, the solar cells derived from the optimized films showed significantly improved PCE from 23.14% to 25.32%. The long&#8208;term stability tests show excellent thermal stability (the optimized device without encapsulation maintaining 82% of its initial PCE after 800 h aging at 85 &#186;C) and an improved light stability under illumination. This work provides a new method, the elastic modulus regulation, to enhance the ripening process.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing a major DNA weakness: resolving the groove and sequence selectivity of the diimine complex [&#923;&#8208;Ru(phen)2phi]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The grooves of DNA provide recognition sites for many nucleic acid binding proteins and anticancer drugs such as the covalently binding cisplatin. Here we report a crystal structure showing, for the first time, groove selectivity by an intercalating ruthenium complex. The complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+, where phi = 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenediimine, is bound to the DNA decamer duplex d(CCGGTACCGG)2. The structure shows that the metal complex is symmetrically bound in the major groove at the central TA/TA step, and asymmetrically bound in the minor groove at the adjacent GG/CC steps. A third type of binding links the strands, in which each terminal cytosine base stacks with one phen ligand. The overall binding stoichiometry is four Ru complexes per duplex. Complementary biophysical measurements confirm the binding preference for the &#923;&#8208;enantiomer and show a high affinity for TA/TA steps and, more generally, TA&#8208;rich sequences. A striking enantiospecific elevation of melting temperatures is found for oligonucleotides which include the TATA box sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding Nanomaterial&#8208;Biosystem Interactions through Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between biosystems and nanomaterials regulate most of their theranostic and nanomedicine applications. These nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and are influenced by a number of entangled factors, including but not limited to the physicochemical features of nanomaterials, the types and characteristics of the interacting biosystems, and the properties of the surrounding microenvironments. Over the years, different experimental approaches coupled with computational modeling have revealed important insights into these interactions, although many outstanding questions remain unanswered. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and to further push the boundary of this field. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and provides our perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Mobile Catalysis for Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal atoms on the support serve as active sites for many heterogeneous catalysts. However, the active metal sites on the support are conventionally described as static, and the intermediates adsorbed on the support far away from the active metal sites cannot be transformed. Herein, we report the first example of operando mobile catalysis to promote catalytic efficiency by enhancing the collision probability between active sites and reactants or reaction intermediates. Specifically, ligand&#8208;coordinated Pt single atoms (isolated MeCpPt&#8208; species) are bonded on CeO2 and transformed into mobile MeCpPt(H)CO complexes during the reverse water gas shift reaction for operando mobile catalysis. This strategy enables the conversion of inert carbonate intermediates on the CeO2 support. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 6358 mol CO2 molPt&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 and 99% CO selectivity at 300 &#176;C is obtained for reverse water gas shift reaction, dramatically higher than those of Pt catalysts reported in the literature. Operando mobile catalysis presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;state Conversion by Asymmetrical Orbital Hybridization in Ni&#8208;doped Co3O4 to Boost Singlet Oxygen Generation for Microbial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a significant role in environmental and biomedical disinfection fields. Electrocatalytic processes hold great potential for 1O2 generation, but remain challenging. Herein, a facile Ni doping converted spin&#8208;state transition approach is reported for boosting 1O2 production. Magnetic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that Ni occupied at the octahedral site of Co3O4 can effectively induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8208;Co3O4 generate appropriate binding strength and enhance electron transfer between the Co centers with oxygen intermediates, thereby improving the catalytic activity of Ni&#8208;Co3O4 for effective generating 1O2. In neutral conditions, 1&#215;106 CFU mL&#8208;1 Gram&#8208;negative ESBL&#8208;producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) could be inactivated by Ni&#8208;Co3O4 system within 5 min. Further antibacterial mechanisms indicate that 1O2 can lead to cell membrane damage and DNA degradation so as to irreversible cell death. Additionally, the developed Ni&#8208;Co3O4 system can effectively inactivate bacteria from wastewater and bioaerosols. This work provides an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;spin electrocatalysis to boost 1O2 generation for disinfection process.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Efficient Single Metal Atom Biocatalysts at the Atomic Structure Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we highlight the design of single metal atom catalysts at the atomic structure level by focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss their biological catalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Various nanomaterials as biocatalysts could be custom&#8208;designed and modified to precisely match the specific microenvironment of diseases, showing a promise in achieving effective therapy outcomes. Compared to conventional biocatalysts, single metal atom catalysts (SMACs) with maximized atom utilization through well&#8208;defined structures offer enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. Currently, there is still a gap in a comprehensive overview of the connection between structures and biocatalytic mechanisms of SMACs. Therefore, it is crucial to deeply investigate the role of SMACs in biocatalysis from the atomic structure level and to elucidate their potential mechanisms in biocatalytic processes. In this minireview, we summarize catalysis regulation methods of SMACs at the atomic structure level, focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss biocatalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Biopolymer Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry was combined with in&#8208;source fragmentation to visualize fragmentation pathways of biopolymers in a three&#8208;dimensional data domain (Precursor m/z, Product m/z, Intensity). By connecting the experimental points in a stairstep pattern, with the diagonal line where the precursor and product m/z values are equal defining the edge of each stair, the sequence of the biopolymer could be reconstructed.







Abstract
Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in&#8208;source collision&#8208;induced dissociation (IS&#8208;CID) with two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS&#8208;CID is employed as a gas&#8208;phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full&#8208;length polysaccharide or peptide ions prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D&#8208;MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule's MSn scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.

         <title>Controllable Assembly of Highly Oxidized Cobalt on Graphdiyne Surface for Efficient Conversion of Nitrogen into Nitric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the incorporation highly oxidized metal species in C(sp)&#8208;rich graphdiyne, nitrogen can selectively and efficiently be converted into *NO, the key intermediate towards nitric acid synthesis. In summary, nitrogen is converted into nitric acid in high yield and good Faraday efficiency







Abstract
The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO3) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO3 from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp&#8208;C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5&#8201;%) were achieved at low potentials.

         <title>Hygroscopic Solutes Enable Non&#8208;van der Waals Electrolytes for Fire&#8208;Tolerant Dual&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the irreversible thermal transformation of electrolytes is typically attributed to solvent boiling, which disrupts solvent intermolecular interactions, our research revealed that hygroscopic solutes shift the determining factor to solute decomposition, breaking solute intramolecular bonds. As intramolecular bonds are much stronger, it enables ultrahigh thermal tolerance of non&#8208;van der Waals solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes.







Abstract
Thermal safety issues of batteries have hindered their large&#8208;scale applications. Nonflammable electrolytes improved safety but solvent evaporation above 100&#8201;&#176;C limited thermal tolerance, lacking reliability. Herein, fire&#8208;tolerant metal&#8208;air batteries were realized by introducing solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes whose hygroscopic solutes could spontaneously reabsorb the evaporated water solvent. Using Zn/CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air/carbon batteries as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, they failed upon burning at 631.8&#8201;&#176;C but self&#8208;recovered then by reabsorbing water from the air at room temperature. Different from conventional aqueous electrolytes whose irreversible thermal transformation is determined by the boiling points of solvents, solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes make this transformation determined by the much higher decomposition temperature of solutes. It was found that stronger intramolecular bonds instead of intermolecular (van der Waals) interactions were strongly correlated to ultra&#8208;high tolerance temperatures of our solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes. Our study would improve the understanding of the thermal properties of electrolytes, guide the design of solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, and enhance battery safety.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Determination of the Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground State of Tridecacene
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tridecacenes were synthesized on Au(111) and their properties were characterized by combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy, inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many body calculations. The study confirmed the open&#8208;shell diradical character and demonstrated that the magnitude of the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap is affected by the proximity of the surface as well as a dynamic electron correlation.







Abstract
The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open&#8208;shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on&#8208;surface synthesis of tridecacene molecules by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on a Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of an inelastic signal at 126&#8197;meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carried out many&#8208;body ab initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonians to take into account the effect of the metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamic electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between the molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap. Thus, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict the Antibacterial Activity of Ruthenium Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine Learning models were trained on the antibacterial activity of 288 ruthenium&#8208;arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and utilised to predict novel compounds based on a virtual library. 54 new compounds were synthesised and found to possess a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate compared to the training set.







Abstract
Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of innovation in the antibiotic pipeline necessitate novel approaches to discovering new drugs. Metal complexes have proven to be promising antimicrobial compounds, but the number of studied compounds is still low compared to the millions of organic molecules investigated so far. Lately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool for guiding the design of small organic molecules, potentially even in low&#8208;data scenarios. For the first time, we extend the application of ML to the discovery of metal&#8208;based medicines. Utilising 288 modularly synthesized ruthenium arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and their antibacterial properties, a series of ML models were trained. The models perform well and are used to predict the activity of 54 new compounds. These displayed a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate (53.7&#8201;%) against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the original library (9.4&#8201;%), demonstrating that ML can be applied to improve the success&#8208;rates in the search of new metalloantibiotics. This work paves the way for more ambitious applications of ML in the field of metal&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;18 Labeling Reveals a Mixed Fe&#8722;O Mechanism in the Last Step of Cytochrome P450 51 Sterol 14&#945;&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450 51 enzymes demethylate sterols, releasing formic acid (DCOOH). Analysis of the DCOOH by&#8208;product enables the mechanistic discrimination of the contribution(s) of Compound 0 (Cpd 0) and Compound I (Cpd I) to catalysis. When enzyme reactions were run under 18O2 (red), &gt;50&#8201;% of the DCOOH yielded contained one atom of 18O (for all P450 51 enzymes tested), indicative of the major contribution of Cpd 0 in 24,25&#8208;dihydrolanosterol C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
The 14&#945;&#8208;demethylation step is critical in eukaryotic sterol biosynthesis, catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) Family 51 enzymes, for example, with lanosterol in mammals. This conserved three&#8208;step reaction terminates in a C&#8722;C cleavage step that generates formic acid, the nature of which has been controversial. Proposed mechanisms involve roles of P450 Compound 0 (ferric peroxide anion, FeO2&#8722;) or Compound I (perferryl oxygen, FeO3+) reacting with either the aldehyde or its hydrate, respectively. Analysis of 18O incorporation into formic acid from 18O2 provides a means of distinguishing the two mechanisms. Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88&#8201;% 18O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO2&#8722; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen atom 3.5&#8197;&#197; away from the heme iron atom. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H218O yielded primarily one 18O atom but 14&#8201;% of the formic acid product with two 18O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8211;MS evidence for a Compound 0&#8208;derived Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;&#8208;formyl ester) was also found.

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled Reversible Folding of Copolymers via Formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization, short pH&#8208;responsive peptides are embedded into the main chain of vinylic polymers. Controlled by pH, these defined peptide sequences dictate the reversible folding of their parent polymers into hydrogen&#8208;bonded architectures, effectively mirroring the translation from primary to higher&#8208;order structures.







Abstract
Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence&#8208;defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure&#8208;driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence&#8208;defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid peptide&#8208;N,N&#8208;Dimethylacrylamide copolymers via radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization (rROP) of peptide containing macrocycles. The resulting synthetic polymers contain sequence&#8208;defined regions of &#946;&#8208;sheet encoding amino acid sequences. Exploiting the pH responsiveness of the embedded sequences, protonation or deprotonation in water induces self&#8208;assembly of the peptide strands at an intramacromolecular level, driving polymer chain folding via formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures. We demonstrate that the folding behavior is sequence dependent and reversible.

         <title>Acetamide Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrite in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen waste species in water. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime, an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide over copper catalysts under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen species. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide for the first time over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2 and wastewater.

         <title>Rational Design of Dinitroxide Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization to Enhance Overall NMR Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eighteen nitroxide biradicals for DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR are compared at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. Among the best performing radicals, the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, works well in both organic and aqueous solvents, making it a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.







Abstract
We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build&#8208;up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall sensitivity across a range of biradicals. NaphPol and HydroPol are found to provide the best overall sensitivity factors, in organic and aqueous solvents respectively. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, provides high sensitivity for all three solvent formulations measured here, and can be considered to be a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Chirality in ClMBA2SnI4 2D Perovskite
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Sn&#8208;based 2D chiral perovskite ClMBA2SnI4 is reported showing appealing optical properties with a low band gap and a broad emission centered in the red part of the spectrum. Computational modelling describes both the chiral transfer effect on the band structure and the origin of broad emission. Preliminary correlations between the nature of chiral ligand and central atom on the chiroptical response of chiral perovskites are proposed.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites possess a huge applicative potential in several areas of optoelectronics and spintronics. The development of novel lead&#8208;free perovskites with tunable properties is a key topic of current research. Herein, we report a novel lead&#8208;free chiral perovskite, namely (R/S&#8722;)ClMBA2SnI4 (ClMBA=1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanamine) and the corresponding racemic system. ClMBA2SnI4 samples exhibit a low band gap (2.12&#8197;eV) together with broad emission extending in the red region of the spectrum (&#8764;1.7&#8197;eV). Chirality transfer from the organic ligand induces chiroptical activity in the 465&#8211;530&#8197;nm range. Density functional theory calculations show a Rashba type band splitting for the chiral samples and no band splitting for the racemic isomer. Self&#8208;trapped exciton formation is at the origin of the large Stokes shift in the emission. Careful correlation with analogous lead and lead&#8208;free 2D chiral perovskites confirms the role of the symmetry&#8208;breaking distortions in the inorganic layers associated with the ligands as the source of the observed chiroptical properties providing also preliminary structure&#8208;property correlation in 2D chiral perovskites.

         <title>Patient&#8208;derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids: A Platform for Chemotherapy Evaluation in the Context of T&#8208;cell Recognition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model to rapidly, precisely and individually evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing is presented. This study bridges the gap between clinical translation and basic research in metalloimmunology, accelerating drug discovery for cancer immunotherapy and facilitating individualized precision medicine.







Abstract
Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these, Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent, demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion.

&lt;p&gt;A patient-derived, T-cell-retaining tumor organoid model to rapidly, precisely and individually evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen-specific T-cell-dependent killing is presented. This study bridges the gap between clinical translation and basic research in metalloimmunology, accelerating drug discovery for cancer immunotherapy and facilitating individualized precision medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient-derived, T-cell-retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen-specific T-cell-dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty-eight Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compounds exhibited potent tumor-killing capabilities. Interestingly, several Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub-micromolar concentrations. Among these, Pt-19, Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent, demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune-related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient-derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a viscosity&#8208;sensitive, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe, ER&#8208;ZS, which can monitor ER stress&#8208;induced viscosity changes in real time. ER&#8208;ZS is also an excellent anti&#8208;hypoxia type&#8197;I photosensitizer that activates tumor cell pyroptosis by damaging the ER pathway.







Abstract
The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type&#8197;I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2&#8201;% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Pyrene&#8208;Based 1,4&#8208;Dithiins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral pyrene&#8208;based 1,4&#8208;dithiins with cisoid or transoid connectivity between their cyclopenta[e]pyrene units on the dithiin core was introduced and their chiroptical properties were studied. The presence of one or two cyclopenta[e]pyrene units at the dithiin moiety was found to lead to different chiroptical parameters.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;dithiin motif is known for its reversible redox properties to generate radical cations and diradical dications and thus is interesting for organic electronic applications. However, examples where this motif is embedded into chiral larger fused aromatic compounds are very rare. Here we describe the syntheses of several structurally related pyrene fused dithiins and their spectroscopic investigations with a focus on tuning circular dichroism, with respect to the g values, depending on their connectivity.

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for upcycling PET waste into high&#8208;valued chemicals. The distinct phase structures of ZrO2, with different acid sites, play a crucial role in regulating product selectivity. Specifically, 5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2, with weak acid sites, shows high selectivity for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of MMB, while 5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2, featuring strong acid sites, predominantly produces overhydrogenated PX







Abstract
Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86&#8201;% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75&#8201;%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8722;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of curved metalloporphyrin tectons via a combination of coordinative and non&#8208;covalent interactions leads to unprecedented supramolecular solids with extremely large void volumes. The intricate interaction patterns found in these solids are analogous to those in some metal&#8208; and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, offering new routes toward porous molecular crystals.







Abstract
A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8208;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68&#8201;% to 76&#8201;%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Shuttling in a Nanosized Metallobox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;nanometer long iridium&#8208;cornered metallorectangle was obtained and used for the encapsulation of a wide variety of planar guests. This slit&#8208;shaped metallobox is able to form host&#8211;guest complexes with a variety of planar molecules, which slide from one side of the cavity to the other, with a large amplitude motion that was experimentally quantified.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;conjoined long and narrow metallorectangle was obtained by combining a quinoxalinophenanthrophenazine&#8208;connected Janus&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene ligand and pyrazine. The size and shape of this assembly together with the fused polyaromatic nature of its panels provides it with properties that are uncommon for other metallosupramolecular assemblies. For example, this nanosized &#8216;slit&#8208;like&#8217; metallobox is able show very large binding affinities with planar organic molecules in such a way, that the cavity is asymmetrically occupied by the guest molecule. This unsymmetrical conformation leads to the existence of a large amplitude motion of these guests, which slide between the two sides of the cavity of the host, thus constituting rare examples of molecular shuttles.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Bipolarolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B was achieved by using a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantiomerically enriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B, which possess an intriguing and complex 5/6/6/6/5 caged pentacyclic skeleton with seven contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis features a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantioenriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.

         <title>Enhanced TROSY Effect in [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C] Adenosine and ATP Analogs Facilitates NMR Spectroscopy of Very Large Biological RNAs in Solution</title>

2&#8208;19F&#8208;2&#8208;13C adenosine&#8212;large RNAs in reach of NMR. An aromatic 19F&#8208;13C isotope labelling protocol for adenosine at position 2 is introduced. The TROSY properties outcompete previous CF pyrimidine labelling Schemes and allowed dynamics, structure, and interaction characterization of 61&#8211;124&#8197;nt 20&#8211;40&#8197;kD RNAs by solution NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Large RNAs are central to cellular functions, but characterizing such RNAs remains challenging by solution NMR. We present two labeling technologies based on [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine, which allow the incorporation of aromatic 19F&#8208;13C spin pairs. The labels when coupled with the transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) enable us to probe RNAs comprising up to 124&#8197;nucleotides. With our new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;phosphoramidite, all resonances of the human hepatitis&#8197;B virus epsilon RNA could be readily assigned. With [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine triphosphate, the 124&#8197;nt pre&#8208;miR&#8208;17&#8208;NPSL1&#8208;RNA was produced via in vitro transcription and the TROSY spectrum of this 40&#8197;kDa [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A&#8208;labeled RNA featured sharper resonances than the [2&#8208;1H, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A sample. The mutual cancelation of the chemical&#8208;shift&#8208;anisotropy and the dipole&#8208;dipole&#8208;components of TROSY&#8208;resonances leads to narrow linewidths over a wide range of molecular weights. With the synthesis of a non&#8208;hydrolysable [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;triphosphate, we facilitate the probing of co&#8208;factor binding in kinase complexes and NMR&#8208;based inhibitor binding studies in such systems. Our labels allow a straightforward assignment for larger RNAs via a divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer/mutational approach. The new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine precursors are a valuable addition to the RNA NMR toolbox and will allow the study of large RNAs/RNA protein complexes in vitro and in cells.

         <title>Toward Simultaneous Dense Zinc Deposition and Broken Side&#8208;Reaction Loops in the Zn//V2O5 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) was developed to achieve dense zinc deposition and broken side&#8208;reaction loops in the Zn//V2O5 system simultaneously.







Abstract
The Zn//V2O5 system not only faces the incontrollable growth of zinc (Zn) dendrites, but also withstands the cross&#8208;talk effect of by&#8208;products produced from the cathode side to the Zn anode, inducing interelectrode talk and aggravating battery failure. To tackle these issues, we construct a rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) to achieve Zn deposition modulation and side reaction inhibition in Zn//V2O5 full cells. The polymer matrix and BN exhibit a robust anchoring effect on SO42&#8722;, accelerating Zn2+ migration and enabling dense Zn deposition behavior. Therefore, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells based on the R&#8208;ZSO electrolyte can operate stably for more than 1500&#8197;h, which is six times higher than that of cells employing the blank electrolyte. More importantly, the R&#8208;ZSO hydrogel electrolyte effectively decouples the cross&#8208;talk effects, thus breaking the infinite loop of side reactions. As a result, the Zn//V2O5 cells using this modified hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate stable operation over 1,000&#8197;cycles, with a capacity loss rate of only 0.028&#8201;% per cycle. Our study provides a promising gel chemistry, which offers a valuable guide for the construction of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reaction Kinetics using a Chemputable Framework for Data Collection and Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ChemPU platform streamlines chemistry by automating kinetic measurements, bridging synthesis and analysis. It's versatile, adaptable, and facilitates precise data encoding of reactions via the Chemical Description Language (XDL). This innovation has the potential to enhance efficiency and create a valuable database of kinetic data for broader applications.







Abstract
Automated chemistry platforms have been widely explored, but many focus on fixed tasks for chemical synthesis or analysis. However, a typical synthetic chemistry workflow utilizes both, such as kinetic measurements for reaction development and optimization. Due to their repetitive and time&#8208;consuming nature, kinetic measurements are often omitted, which limits the mechanistic investigation of reactions. Herein, we present a &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; platform with on&#8208;line analytics (UV/Vis, NMR) which automates routine kinetic measurements. The system's capabilities are showcased by exploring an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder using initial rate measurements, a metal complexation using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA), and formation of a series of tosylamide derivatives using Hammett analysis. Over 60 individual experiments are presented which required minimal intervention, highlighting the significant time savings of automation. Owing to the modular design of the platform, which facilitates rapid integration of commercial analytical tools, our approach is widely accessible and adjustable to the reaction under investigation. The platform is operated using the chemical programming language, XDL, hence experimental procedures and results are stored in a precise, computer&#8208;readable format. We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.

We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Bismuth&#8208;Halide Perovskite in Mesochannels of Silica Nanomembranes for Exceptional Photocatalytic Abatement of Air Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoconfined photocatalysis promises to achieve challenging chemical transformation, but the influence of confined structure has been ignored. Here, we propose a confinement model by encapsulating Cs3Bi2Br9 into one&#8208;dimensional insulated channels of porous silica nanomembranes, rendering the concentrated electric field, high exposure of &#8901;O2&#8722; and enhanced mass transfer for exceptional photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement.







Abstract
Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas&#8208;solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70&#8197;nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO conversion efficiency of 98.2&#8201;% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14&#8197;h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15&#8211;90&#8201;%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#8901;O2&#8722; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs3Bi2Br9. This work expands an innovative strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts for air pollution remediation.

         <title>Intramolecular Triplet Diffusion Facilitates Triplet Dissociation in a Pentacene Hexamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in covalent systems. We have developed a hexameric pentacene system, in which three pentacene dimers are covalently linked to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. This allows for an entropically driven triplet diffusion, resulting in higher yields of free triplets, and establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems.







Abstract
Triplet dynamics in singlet fission depend strongly on the strength of the electronic coupling. Covalent systems in solution offer precise control over such couplings. Nonetheless, efficient free triplet generation remains elusive in most systems, as the intermediate triplet pair 1(T1T1) is prone to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation due to its spatial confinement. In the solid state, entropically driven triplet diffusion assists in the spatial separation of triplets, resulting in higher yields of free triplets. Control over electronic coupling in the solid state is, however, challenging given its sensitivity to molecular packing. We have thus developed a hexameric system (HexPnc) to enable solid&#8208;state&#8208;like triplet diffusion at the molecular scale. This system is realized by covalently tethering three pentacene dimers to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. Transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical structural optimizations and steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, reveals that triplet diffusion is indeed facilitated due to intramolecular cluster formation. The yield of free triplets in HexPnc is increased by a factor of up to 14 compared to the corresponding dimeric reference (DiPnc). Thus, HexPnc establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems by providing avenues for diffusive separation of 1(T1T1), while, concomitantly, retaining strong interchromophore coupling which preserves rapid formation of 1(T1T1).

         <title>Microbubble Biointerfacing by Regulation of the Platelet Membrane Surfactant Activity at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface for Acute Thrombosis Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbubbles can be biointerfaced by rationally regulating the platelet membrane surfactant activity at the gas&#8208;liquid interface. The protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratios (P&#8201;:&#8201;L ratios) of the platelet membranes are reduced to stabilize the platesome microbubbles (PMBs). The activated conformation of &#945;IIb&#946;3 grants PMBs the ability for molecular ultrasound diagnosis of acute thrombosis.







Abstract
Biointerfacing nanomaterials with cell membranes has been successful in the functionalization of nanoparticles or nanovesicles, but microbubble functionalization remains challenging due to the unique conformation of the lipid monolayer structure at the gas&#8208;liquid interface that provides insufficient surfactant activity. Here, we describe a strategy to rationally regulate the surfactant activity of platelet membrane vesicles by adjusting the ratio of proteins to lipids through fusion with synthetic phospholipids (i.e., liposomes). A &#8220;platesome&#8221; with the optimized protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio can be assembled at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in the same manner as pulmonary surfactants to stabilize a microsized gas bubble. Platesome microbubbles (PMBs) inherited 61.4&#8201;% of the platelet membrane vesicle proteins and maintained the active conformation of integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 without the talin&#8197;1 for fibrin binding. We demonstrated that the PMBs had good stability, long circulation, and superior functionality both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by molecular ultrasound imaging, the PMBs provide up to 11.8&#8197;dB of ultrasound signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement for discriminating between acute and chronic thrombi. This surface tension regulating strategy may provide a paradigm for biointerfacing microbubbles with cell membranes, offering a potential new approach for the construction of molecular ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of different diseases.

         <title>Intermediates in Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Minireview we present and discussed a series of examples from various areas in which reactive intermediates have been detected during mechanochemical reactions. Understanding the factors behind the formation and stabilization of these intermediates could enhance mechanochemical methods and chemical reaction development.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions offer methodological and environmental advantages for chemical synthesis, constantly attracting attention within the scientific community. Besides unmistakable sustainability advantages, the conditions under which mechanochemical reactions occur, namely solventless conditions, sometimes facilitate the isolation of otherwise labile or inaccessible products. Despite these advantages, limited knowledge exists regarding the mechanisms of these reactions and the types of intermediates involved. Nevertheless, in an expanding number of cases, ex situ and in situ monitoring techniques have allowed for the observation, characterization, and isolation of reaction intermediates in mechanochemical transformations. In this Minireview, we present a series of examples in which reactive intermediates have been detected in mechanochemical reactions spanning organic, organometallic, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Many of these intermediates were stabilized by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which played a pivotal role in guiding the chemical transformations. We believe that by uncovering and understanding such instances, the growing mechanochemistry community could find novel opportunities in catalysis and discover new mechanochemical reactions while achieving simplification in chemical reaction design.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Magnetism&#8208;Conversion Nanoprobes for Activatable Ultra&#8208;High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) with tunable nanomagnetism for ultra&#8208;high field (UHF)&#8208;tailored activatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement. Under a 9 T MRI, the pH&#8208;sensitive alteration in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity within the MCNP leads to a remarkable &gt;10&#8208;fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) value (10.6&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, pH&#8197;5.0), as compared to the value observed at neutral pH.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a focal point of interest in the field of cancer diagnosis. Despite the ability of current paramagnetic or superparamagnetic smart MRI contrast agents to selectively enhance tumor signals in low&#8208;field MRI, their effectiveness at UHF remains inadequate due to inherent magnetism. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) composed of 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid ligand&#8208;coated silver&#8208;gadolinium bimetallic nanoparticles. The MCNP exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent magnetism conversion from ferromagnetism to diamagnetism, facilitating tunable nanomagnetism for pH&#8208;activatable UHF MRI. Under neutral pH, the thiolate (&#8722;S&#8722;) ligands lead to short &#964;&#8242;m and increased magnetization of the MCNPs. Conversely, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the thiolate ligands are protonated and transform into thiol (&#8722;SH) ligands, resulting in prolonged &#964;&#8242;m and decreased magnetization of the MCNP, thereby enhancing longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values at UHF MRI. Notably, under a 9&#8197;T MRI field, the pH&#8208;sensitive changes in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity of the MCNP lead to a remarkable (&gt;10&#8208;fold) r1 increase in an acidic medium (pH&#8197;5.0). In vivo studies demonstrate the capability of MCNPs to amplify MRI signal of hepatic tumors, suggesting their potential as a next&#8208;generation UHF&#8208;tailored smart MRI contrast agent.

&lt;p&gt;We develop a novel ligand-mediated magnetism-conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) with tunable nanomagnetism for ultra-high field (UHF)-tailored activatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement. Under a 9 T MRI, the pH-sensitive alteration in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity within the MCNP leads to a remarkable &amp;gt;10-fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) value (10.6&#8197;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, pH&#8197;5.0), as compared to the value observed at neutral pH.

         <title>Synthesis of Topological Gels by Penetrating Polymerization Using a Molecular Net</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints. We synthesized a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure. When a water&#8208;soluble monomer was polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrated the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components.







Abstract
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints; ideally, no attractive intermolecular interactions act between their components, which yields interesting physical properties. However, most reported previous topological gels were synthesized based on supramolecular interlocked structures such as polyrotaxane, for which attractive intermolecular interactions are essential. Here, we synthesize a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure using poly(ethylene glycol). When a water&#8208;soluble monomer (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) is polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrates the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components. The MN gels show unique physical properties as well a significantly high degree of swelling and high extensibility due to slipping of the physical cross&#8208;linking. We postulate this method to yield a new paradigm in gel science with unprecedented physical properties.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Bioorthogonal Tumor&#8208;Membrane Reactor for In Situ Selective and Sustained Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor cell membrane reactors are constructed in vivo for the precise location control of prodrug activation, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting liposomes install the bioorthogonal trigger on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that activates an externally delivered prodrug in situ.







Abstract
The site&#8208;specific activation of bioorthogonal prodrugs has provided great opportunities for reducing the severe side effects of chemotherapy. However, the precise control of activation location, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency in vivo remain great challenges. Here, we propose the construction of tumor cell membrane reactors in vivo to solve the above problems. Specifically, tumor&#8208;targeted liposomes with efficient membrane fusion capabilities are generated to install the bioorthogonal trigger, the amphiphilic tetrazine derivative, on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as many living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that in situ activates an externally delivered bioorthogonal prodrug, for example intratumorally injected transcyclooctene&#8208;caged doxorubicin. In contrast to the rapid elimination of cargo that is encapsulated and delivered by liposomes, these reactors permit stable retention of bioorthogonal triggers in tumor for 96&#8197;h after a single dose of liposomes via intravenous injection, allowing sustained generation of doxorubicin. Interestingly, an additional supplement of liposomes will compensate for the trigger consumed by the reaction and significantly improve the efficiency of the local reaction. This strategy provides a solution to the efficacy versus safety dilemma of tumor chemotherapy.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum responsive naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts are obtained by co&#8208;assembly through a rapid solution dispersion method, creating a giant internal electric field (IEF) via the larger local dipole. The IEF can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers and promote charge&#8208;transfer excitation. The photocatalysts are capable of efficient overall water splitting.







Abstract
The co&#8208;assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co&#8208;assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O2 evolution rate with 2.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using AgNO3 as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13&#8201;%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a direct Z&#8208;Scheme pathway of carriers contributed to a high redox potential. The strategy provided a new perspective for the design of supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning Active Site Flexibility by Defect Engineering of Graphene Ribbon Edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8722;N3 Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper elucidates the critical role of vertical displacement of Fe atom, which can be modulated by defect engineering, in tuning the electron structure and stabilizing the transition state of rate&#8208;determining step, and demonstrates that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity is determined by the flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site, which is further affected by the Fe&#8722;N bond length. Importantly, this simple geometric parameter is tunable and readily probed experimentally.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported transition metal catalysts are excellent for several reactions. Structural engineering of M&#8722;Nx sites to boost catalytic activity is rarely studied. Here, we demonstrate that the structural flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site is vital for tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms and regulating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) activity. By introducing carbon defects, we construct Fe&#8722;N3 sites with varying Fe&#8722;N bond lengths distinguishable by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We investigate the CTH activity by density&#8208;functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8722;N3 distortion, raises the Fe 
orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8722;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high&#8208;performing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by defect engineering.

We investigate the CTH activity by density-functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; distortion, raises the Fe 
orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8722;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high-performing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by defect engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Azomethine Imines and Neuroprotective Activity Evaluation</title>

The synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides is described, showing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Biological studies revealed the neuroprotective activity of the S product for dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin.







Abstract
Azomethine imines, as a prominent class of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, hold great significance and potential in organic and medicinal chemistry. However, the reported synthesis of centrally chiral azomethine imines relies on kinetic resolution, and the construction of axially chiral azomethine imines remains unexplored. Herein, we present the synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed ring&#8208;closure reactions of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides, showcasing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the biological evaluation revealed that the synthesized axially chiral azomethine imines effectively protect dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin, offering a promising therapeutic approach for chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Remarkably, the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.

         <title>Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt&#8208;based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect&#8208;Mediated Dopant Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced activity and stability of surface&#8208;doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic&#8208;scale description for group VI transition metal oxide&#8208;doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.







Abstract
Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. However, these alloys are susceptible to metal loss through leaching and degradation, leading to reduced catalyst stability and activity. Recently, it has been shown that doping with oxophilic elements can significantly alleviate these problems, with a prominent example being Mo&#8208;doped Pt alloys. Here, to achieve atomic scale understanding of the exceptional activity and stability of these alloys, we present a detailed density functional theory description of the dopants&#8217; structures and impact on electrocatalyst properties. Beginning with the Mo/Pt system, we demonstrate that Mo can be stabilized in the form of low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide moieties on Pt defects. The resulting structures enhance stability and activity via distinct physical processes, with the Mo moieties both directly inhibiting Pt dissolution at defects and indirectly enhancing ORR activity by generation of strain fields on surrounding Pt terraces. We then generalize these analyses to other metal dopant elements, and we demonstrate that similar low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide structures control the electrocatalytic properties through an intricate interplay of the structures&#8217; acid stability, intrinsic activity for the ORR, and ability to induce ORR&#8208;promoting strain fields on Pt.

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphiles using a Functionalization&#8208;Defunctionalization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated &#8220;functionalization&#8208;defunctionalization&#8221; approach efficiently produces bio&#8208;based surfactants directly from the hemicellulose and lignin fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. The performance of the resulting sugar and lignin&#8208;based surfactants are competitive with existing commercial products, highlighting the potential for using these biomass fractions as surfactants with minimal structural modification.







Abstract
Concerns over the sustainability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life properties of fossil&#8208;derived surfactants have driven interest in bio&#8208;based alternatives. Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29&#8201;% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80&#8201;% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.

         <title>Surface Activation by Single Ru Atoms for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>

Stable single Ru atoms on the surface of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948; (SDC) could evidently modify the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Cathodic CO2 adsorption and activation is essential for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal&#8208;support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru1/SDC&#8208;La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V and 800&#8201;&#176;C. This work expands the application of single atom catalyst to the high&#8208;temperature electrocatalytic reaction in SOEC and provides an efficient strategy to tailor the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of SOEC cathode at the atomic scale.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Terminal Alkynes Involving in Situ&#8208;Generated &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of terminal aryl alkynes with sulfilimines was achieved. It proceeds via an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization or Pictet&#8211;Spengler reactions to selectively form fused indoles. The formation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles and imidazoles derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization is also presented.







Abstract
An efficient, highly selective and divergent synthetic method to construct 2&#8208;substituted indoles and aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles via the intermolecular generation of &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes from terminal alkynes or diynes in combination with sulfilimines is disclosed. Importantly, the tandem reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by the activation of a second alkyne leading to 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, which is significantly different from previous dual activation or 1,6&#8208;carbene shift approaches for diyne systems. In the case of ortho&#8208;alkynylaniline as starting material, an unexpected regioselective formation of the indole moiety via the intermolecular path, instead of intramolecular hydroamination was discovered. This reactivity paved the way for a one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 11H&#8208;indolo [3,2&#8208;c] quinoline scaffold by exploiting the formed amino indole for a subsequent Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with aldehydes. The photophysical properties of the carbazoles indicated good violet&#8208;blue emission with quantum yields up to 40&#8201;%.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La Species Enabling Atomic&#8208;Level Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure and Favored Reaction Thermodynamics for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, facilitating the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Intermediates adsorbed on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species in the CH4 production from CO2 form are more thermodynamically favorable. The photocatalyst exhibits outstanding CH4 selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) and high CH4 production rate (125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), over ten times of that for CN.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi&#8208;electron steps. Achieving high CH4 activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in CO2 reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual&#8208;atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3 coordination bonds connected by Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO2 reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH4 formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) for CH4 formation with a yield of 125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional dual&#8208;atom based photocatalysts.

         <title>Enzymatic Peptide and Protein Bromination: The BromoTrp Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of the Trp 6&#8208;halogenase Thal allows post&#8208;translational bromination of a tetrapeptide tag with C&#8208;terminal tryptophan in proteins on a preparative scale using the brominating E. coli coexpression strain Brocoli. The bromoarene can be derivatized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling at 37&#8201;&#176;C. This opens new avenues for bio&#8208;orthogonal modification of proteins by biocatalytic bromination of minimally tagged proteins.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides are of high value in chemical biology. The combination of enzymatic halogenation with transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling provides a feasible approach for the modification of proteins and unprotected peptides. By a semirational protein engineering approach, variants of the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal were identified that enable efficient bromination of peptides with a C&#8208;terminal tryptophan residue. The substrate scope was explored using di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide arrays, leading to the identification of an optimized peptide tag we named BromoTrp tag. This tag was introduced into three model proteins. Preparative scale post&#8208;translational bromination was possible with only a single cultivation and purification step using the brominating E. coli coexpression system Brocoli. Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the bromoarene was achieved with Pd nanoparticle catalysts at 37&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the rich potential of this strategy for bio&#8208;orthogonal functionalization and conjugation.

         <title>Accelerating S&#8596;Li2S Reactions in Li&#8211;S Batteries through Activation of S/Li2S with a Bifunctional Semiquinone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction pathway that a soluble semiquinone serves as bifunction catalyst for reducing S and oxidizing Li2S is firstly demonstrated to substantially improve the reaction kinetic of S&#8596;Li2S interconversion, and the assembled Li&#8722;S batteries exhibit the remarkable performance.







Abstract
The reaction rate bottleneck during interconversion between insulating S8 (S) and Li2S fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricted lifespan of Li&#8722;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;semianthraquinone lithium (Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;), as both e&#8208;/Li+ donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li2S oxidation. The efficient activation of S and Li2S by Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; in the initial discharging/charging state maximizes the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid reaction by promoting long&#8208;range electron transfer. With in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the activation of S/Li2S is the rate&#8208;limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, the S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 1&#8197;C compared to those without Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;. We hope this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S redox chemical and inspires the design of efficient catalysis for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>One Collision&#8212;Two Substituents: Gas&#8208;Phase Preparation of Xylenes under Single&#8208;Collision Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl radical with C5H8 isomers (2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene, 1,3&#8208;pentadiene). Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.







Abstract
The fundamental reaction pathways to the simplest dialkylsubstituted aromatics&#8212;xylenes (C6H4(CH3)2)&#8212;in high&#8208;temperature combustion flames and in low&#8208;temperature extraterrestrial environments are still unknown, but critical to understand the chemistry and molecular mass growth processes in these extreme environments. Exploiting crossed molecular beam experiments augmented by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure and statistical calculations, this study uncovers a previously elusive, facile gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl (methylethynyl, CH3CC) with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (isoprene, C5H8). The reaction dynamics are driven by a barrierless addition of the radical to the diene moiety of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene followed by extensive isomerization (hydrogen shifts, cyclization) prior to unimolecular decomposition accompanied by aromatization via atomic hydrogen loss. This overall exoergic reaction affords a preparation of xylenes not only in high&#8208;temperature environments such as in combustion flames and around circumstellar envelopes of carbon&#8208;rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, but also in low&#8208;temperature cold molecular clouds (10&#8197;K) and in hydrocarbon&#8208;rich atmospheres of planets and their moons such as Triton and Titan. Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.

         <title>Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core&#8208;Shell Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism is proposed to understand the two orders of magnitude enhancement of the kinetics for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on Pd@Pt core&#8211;shell model than pure Pd. Surface Pt atoms promote the H2 dissociation and the adsorbed hydrogen (Had) incorporation into the Pd lattice. Internal PdHx (PdHab) act as a hydrogen reservoir, providing LH to migrate to the surface Pt and combine with OH&#8722; to form water.







Abstract
Tracking the trajectory of hydrogen intermediates during hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis is beneficial for designing synergetic multi&#8208;component catalysts with division of chemical labor. Herein, we demonstrate a novel dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism that leads to two orders of magnitude increase in the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity on Pd@Pt over pure Pd, even &#8776;31.8&#8197;times mass activity enhancement than commercial Pt. Specifically, the polarization&#8208;driven electrochemical hydrogenation process from Pd@Pt to PdHx@Pt by incorporating LH allows more surface vacancy Pt sites to increase the surface H coverage. The inverse dehydrogenation process makes PdHx as an H reservoir, providing LH migrates to the surface of Pt and participates in the HOR. Meanwhile, the formation of PdHx induces electronic effect, lowering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining Volmer step, thus resulting in the HOR kinetics on Pd@Pt being proportional to the LH concentration in the in situ formed PdHx@Pt. Moreover, this dynamic catalysis mechanism would open up the catalysts scope for hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO by a Phosphine&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Phosphine Ir(III) Catalyst: Photophysics, Nonadiabatic Effects, Mechanism, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly accurate multi&#8208;reference calculations reveal the photophysical processes of a PNNP&#8208;type iridium catalyst, namely [Ir(III)H]+, and its subsequent reduction reactions to either HCOOH or CO. The present results depict the efficient reaction scenario, explain the origin of the HCOOH selectivity, and contribute to design new photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the best solutions to solve the global energy crisis and to realize carbon neutralization. The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer (SET) and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Mixed Metal Sulfamates with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties and Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate, Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, with the consistent&#8208;orientation&#8208;alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra exhibits an exceptionally large dipole moment, yielding a wide deep&#8208;UV transparent window, an enhanced SHG response of ca. 2.3&#8197;times that of KDP, and a suited birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180&#8197;nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3&#8197;times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.

Remarkably, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co-parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non-&#960;-conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3&#8197;times that of KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and a large birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non-&#960;-conjugated NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Neuromorphic Modulation and Biosensing based on N&#8208;type Small&#8208;molecule Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>

         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type semiconductor&#8208;based organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS) enables superior synapse characteristics in a single device with an unprecedented combination of facile fabrication, excellent ambient stability, and robust and flexible tunability. The OENS was used as a biosensor to detect dopamine at sub&#8208;micromolar level in aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
The ion/chemical&#8208;based modulation feature of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are critical to advancing next generation bio&#8208;integrated neuromorphic hardware. Despite achievements with polymeric OMIECs in organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS). However, small molecule OMIECs based OENS has not yet been realized. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate an effective materials design concept of combining n&#8208;type fused all&#8208;acceptor small molecule OMIECs with subtle side chain optimization that enables robustly and flexibly modulating versatile synaptic behavior and sensing neurotransmitter in solid or aqueous electrolyte, operating in accumulation modes. By judicious tuning the ending side chains, the linear oligoether and butyl chain derivative gNR&#8208;Bu exhibits higher recognition accuracy for a model artificial neural network (ANN) simulation, higher steady conductance states and more outstanding ambient stability, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art n&#8208;type OMIECs based OENS. These superior artificial synapse characteristics of gNR&#8208;Bu can be attributed to its higher crystallinity with stronger ion bonding capacities. More impressively, we unprecedentedly realized n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OMIECs based OENS as a neuromorphic biosensor enabling to respond synaptic communication signals of dopamine even at sub&#8208;&#956;M level in aqueous electrolyte. This work may open a new path of small&#8208;molecule ion&#8208;electron conductors for next&#8208;generation ANN and bioelectronics.

         <title>Unraveling Dynamic Helicity Inversion and Chirality Transfer through the Synthesis of Discrete Azobenzene Oligomers by an Iterative Exponential Growth Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete azooligomers and their corresponding assemblies were synthesized by an iterative exponential growth strategy involving dynamic helicity inversion and chirality transfer. The interconversion of H&#8208;aggregates and J&#8208;aggregates in discrete azooligomer assemblies results in different helicity reversals and morphological transitions.







Abstract
Unraveling the chirality transfer mechanism of polymer assemblies and controlling their handedness is beneficial for exploring the origin of hierarchical chirality and developing smart materials with desired chiroptical activities. However, polydisperse polymers often lead to an ambiguous or statistical evaluation of the structure&#8211;property relationship, and it remains unclear how the iterative number of repeating units function in the helicity inversion of polymer assemblies. Herein, we report the macroscopic helicity and dynamic manipulation of the chiroptical activity of supramolecular assemblies from discrete azobenzene&#8208;containing oligomers (azooligomers), together with the helicity inversion and morphological transition achieved solely by changing the iterative chain lengths. The corresponding assemblies also differ from their polydisperse counterparts in terms of thermodynamic properties, chiroptical activities, and morphological control.

         <title>Interphase Regulation by Multifunctional Additive Empowering High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Cycle Life and Thermal Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

A novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP) is designed to effectively suppress the HF generation and facilitate the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer, empowering NCM811/S650 full cells with enhanced cycle life and thermal safety.







Abstract
High energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) adopting high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes and silicon&#8208;based composite anodes always suffer from unsatisfied cycle life and poor safety performance, especially at elevated temperatures. Electrode /electrolyte interphase regulation by functional additives is one of the most economic and efficacious strategies to overcome this shortcoming. Herein, cyano&#8208;groups (&#8722;CN) are introduced into lithium fluorinated phosphate to synthesize a novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP), which endows high nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/SiOx&#8208;graphite composite full cell with an ultrahigh cycle life and superior safety characteristics, by adding only 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% LiTFTCP into a LiPF6&#8208;carbonate baseline electrolyte. It is revealed that LiTFTCP additive effectively suppresses the HF generation and facilitates the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer. The favorable SEI/CEI layers greatly lessen the electrode degradation, electrolyte consumption, thermal&#8208;induced gassing and total heat&#8208;releasing. This work illuminates the importance of additive molecular engineering and interphase regulation in simultaneously promoting the cycling and thermal safety of LIBs with high&#8208;nickel NCMxyz cathode and silicon&#8208;based composite anode.

         <title>Photocatalytic Production of Ethanolamines and Ethylenediamines from Bio&#8208;Polyols over a Cu/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/TiO2 catalyst with multiple active sites was developed to produce ethanolamines and ethylenediamines from bio&#8208;polyols via a photocatalytic process in one pot. Oxidation by photogenerated holes over TiO2 was responsible for the C&#8722;C bond cleavage of polyols, and metallic copper was active for reductive amination via self&#8208;hydrogen transfer. It affords a novel strategy for biomass conversion to aminated compounds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Valorization of biomass&#8208;derived polyols into high&#8208;value&#8208;added ethanolamines and ethylenediamines is highly attractive. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step photocatalytic protocol to convert bio&#8208;polyols into a 60&#8201;% yield of ethanolamines and ethylenediamines over a multifunctional Cu/TiO2 catalyst. This catalyst enables a tandem process of photocatalytic polyol C&#8722;C bond cleavage and reductive amination in one pot at room temperature, and also allows the selective conversion of various bio&#8208;polyols and amines. Mechanistic studies revealed that photogenerated holes in TiO2 promote the retro&#8208;aldol C&#8722;C bond cleavage or oxidative dehydrogenation of polyols, and photogenerated electrons accumulate on small&#8208;sized Cu clusters, which facilitate the reductive amination via hydrogen transfer and prevent the H2 generation. This strategy provides new opportunities for the development of non&#8208;noble metal photocatalysts and methods of biomass conversion under mild conditions.

         <title>A Homopolymer of Xanthenoxanthene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Heteroaromatic for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting homopolymer, hailing from an electron&#8208;rich peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic monomer, produces uniform films with heightened hole mobility, amplified modulus, and constrained species diffusion. These attributes enable the construction of perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, which also exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational durability.







Abstract
Highly efficient perovskite solar cells typically rely on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as a hole transporter, achieving a 25.7&#8201;% efficiency record. However, these cells are susceptible to harsh 85&#8201;&#176;C conditions. Here, we present a peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based semiconducting homopolymer (p&#8208;TNI2) with matched energy levels and a high molecular weight, synthesized nearly quantitatively through facile oxidative polymerization. Compared to established materials, p&#8208;TNI2 excels in hole mobility, morphology, modulus, and waterproofing. Implementing p&#8208;TNI2 as the hole transport layer results in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, rivaling 24.4&#8201;% for the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD control cells under identical conditions. Furthermore, the p&#8208;TNI2&#8208;based cells exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational robustness.

         <title>A Fully Amorphous, Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linked Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Operating at Subzero&#8208;Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

We demonstrate a fully amorphous quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a dynamic cross&#8208;linked network composed of a star&#8208;shaped plasticising polymer and a linear poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The electrolyte achieves high Li+ conductivity (2.96&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high tLi+ (0.81), and the as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries exhibit high reversible capacity and long cycle life when operating at subzero temperature conditions.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li&#8208;ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li+&#8208;conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross&#8208;linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &gt;90&#8201;% was prepared from the cross&#8208;linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li+ conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 0&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.

         <title>Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor 2&#8208;Tagged Aptamer Chimeras (ITACs) Modular Assembly for Targeted and Efficient Degradation of Two Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

Insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) enable robust targeted degradation of pathogenic membrane proteins and allow simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins.







Abstract
Overexpression of pathogenic membrane proteins drives abnormal proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Various strategies to durably knockdown membrane proteins with heterobifunctional degraders have been successfully developed, including LYTAC, KineTAC, and AbTAC. However, challenges including complicated synthetic procedures and the inability to simultaneously degrade multiple pathogenic proteins still exist. Herein, we developed insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) that link the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;targeting receptor IGF2R and membrane proteins of interest (POIs) based on specific recognition of aptamers to the POIs and high&#8208;affinity binding of IGF2 to IGF2R. We demonstrated that ITACs exhibit robust degradation efficiency of various membrane proteins in multiple cell lines. Furthermore, systematic studies revealed that a moderate cell&#8208;surface IGF2R level is responsible for the excellent degradation performance of ITACs. Importantly, we further established a modular assembly strategy that allows assembly of one IGF2 with two aptamers with precise stoichiometry (dITACs), enabling cooperative and simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins. This work provides an efficient and facile target membrane protein degradation platform and will shed light on the treatment of diseases related to the overexpression of membrane proteins.

         <title>Implanting Transition Metal into Li2O&#8208;Based Cathode Prelithiation Agent for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Co into specific Li sites within the Li2O framework adjusts band structures, weakens the Li&#8722;O interaction, and accelerates the decomposition kinetics of Li2O. It can serve as a cathode prelithiation agent to compensate for the irreversible lithium loss during the initial cycling, thus enhancing the energy density and cycle life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.







Abstract
Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy&#8208;density and cycle&#8208;life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell, especially after employing high&#8208;capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li2O, obtaining (Li0.66Co0.11&#9633;0.23)2O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co&#8208;derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8722;O interaction of Li2O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O2, achieving 1642.7&#8197;mAh/g~Li2O prelithiation capacity (&#8776;980&#8197;mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% CLO&#8208;based prelithiation agent with LiCoO2 cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270&#8197;Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with 92&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

Single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties were designed to replace lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine in doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), which can oxidize Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance. The devices based on this oxidizing Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.







Abstract
To date, perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) with doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) hole transporting layers (HTLs) have shown the highest recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, their commercialization is still impeded by poor device stability owing to the hygroscopic lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and volatile 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine dopants as well as time&#8208;consuming oxidation in air. In this study, we explored a series of single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties to precisely manipulate the oxidation states of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance, and the oxidation mechanism was clearly understood. Iodine (III) in the diphenyliodonium cation (IP+) can accept a single electron from Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and forms Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ owing to its strong oxidability. Moreover, because of the coordination of the strongly delocalized TFSI&#8722; with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ in a stable radical complex, the resulting hole mobility was 30&#8197;times higher than that of pristine Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. In addition, the IP&#8208;TFSI initiator facilitated the growth of a homogeneous and pinhole&#8208;free Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD film. The pero&#8208;SCs based on this oxidizing HTL showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Coordinated W2S3 for Efficient Dual&#8208;pH Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 crystal has been reported based on the theoretical structure prediction in combination with experimental results. For application in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,PEM=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,AEM=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM, 360 h@AEM).







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that play a crucial role in renewable energy technologies. Breaking the inherent structural paradigm limitations of 2D TMDs is the key to exploring their fascinating physical and chemical properties, which is expected to develop a revolutionary HER catalyst. Herein, we unambiguously present metallic W2S3 instead of energetically favorable WS2 via a unique stoichiometric growth strategy. Benefiting from the excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity of the tetra&#8208;coordinated structure, as well as an appropriate Gibbs free energy value and an enough low energy barrier for water dissociation, the W2S3 as catalyst achieves Pt&#8208;like HER activity and high long&#8208;term stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. For application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;
=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;
=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM with a decay rate of 85.7&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1, 360 h@AEM with a decay rate of 27.1&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our work provides significant insight into the tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 and facilitates the development of advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Activation of a Microtubule Polymerization Inhibitor via Amide Functionalization of the Ruthenium Photocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamide functionalization of a green light&#8208;sensitive photoactivated chemotherapy agent based on ruthenium fine&#8208;tuned its excited states, dramatically improving red light absorption. The new prodrug inhibited microtubule polymerization under red light activation, efficiently killing cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, red light activation shrank non&#8208;melanoma skin tumors in mice, while in the dark the prodrug showed improved biosafety.







Abstract
Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that kills cancer cells via photochemical uncaging of a cytotoxic drug. Most ruthenium&#8208;based photocages used for PACT are activated with blue or green light, which penetrates sub&#8208;optimally into tumor tissues. Here, we report amide functionalization as a tool to fine&#8208;tune the toxicity and excited states of a terpyridine&#8208;based ruthenium photocage. Due to conjugation of the amide group with the terpyridine &#960; system in the excited state, the absorption of red light (630&#8197;nm) increased 8&#8208;fold, and the photosubstitution rate rose 5&#8208;fold. In vitro, red light activation triggered inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which led to apoptotic cell death both in normoxic (21&#8201;% O2) and hypoxic (1&#8201;% O2) cancer cells. In vivo, red light irradiation of tumor&#8208;bearing mice demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction (45&#8201;%) with improved biosafety, thereby demonstrating the clinical potential of this compound.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ultraviolet Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Resonance Phosphine Oxide Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new phosphine oxide based multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeleton is demonstrated with CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO featuring highly efficient ultraviolet (UV) multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, whose device achieved narrow&#8208;band emissions with peaks at &#8776;380&#8197;nm and full widths at half maximum of &#8776;30&#8197;nm, and especially record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies beyond 15&#8201;%.







Abstract
Efficient ultraviolet (UV) electroluminescent materials remain a great challenge, since short peak wavelength &lt;400&#8197;nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) &lt;50&#8197;nm are simultaneously required. In this sense, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring narrow&#8208;band emissions hold the promise for UV applications. Herein, a novel MR&#8208;TADF skeleton featuring carbazole&#8208;phosphine oxide (P=O) fused aromatics is developed to construct the first two UV MR emitters named CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO. In addition to synergistic resonance effects of P=O and N atom, sp3&#8208;hybrid P atom renders the curved polycyclic planes of CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO, giving rise to their narrowband UV emissions with peak wavelengths &lt;390&#8197;nm and FWHM&lt;35&#8197;nm. Besides configuration quasi&#8208;planarization for radiation enhancement and quenching suppression, P=O moiety further enhances singlet&#8208;triplet coupling to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence quantum yield of 62&#8201;% in tBCzP2PO doped films. As consequence, tBCzP2PO endowed its UV organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak at 382&#8197;nm and FWHM of 32&#8197;nm, and especially the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.1&#8201;% among all kinds of UV devices. Our results demonstrate great potential of P=O based MR emitters in practical applications including optoelectronics, biology and medicine science.

As consequence, &lt;b&gt;tBCzP2PO&lt;/b&gt; endowed its UV organic light-emitting diodes with the peak at 382&#8197;nm and FWHM of 32&#8197;nm, and especially the record-high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.1&#8201;% among all kinds of UV devices. Our results demonstrate great potential of P=O based MR emitters in practical applications including optoelectronics, biology and medicine science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Nanospace in Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Investigated by 129Xe NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
129Xe NMR spectroscopy of a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline material fabricated using imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles revealed a spatiotemporally continuous void inside the column. The diameter of the channel&#8208;like nanospace was estimated to be 0.49&#8197;nm, and the diffusion coefficient of the Xe atoms inside the nanochannels was comparable to those of conventional microporous solid materials.







Abstract
Continuous nanopores within fluid materials could be used for novel chemical events such as the accommodation of guest molecules, unique arrays of the entrapped molecules, and chemical reactions in a dynamic molecular assembly. Columnar liquid crystals composed of a one&#8208;dimensionally stacked assembly of shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles form nanochannels owing to the intrinsic nanospace in the column. However, the existence of substantial nanoporosity has not been confirmed experimentally thus far. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we confirmed the presence of discrete and spatiotemporally continuous voids in a liquid&#8208;crystalline material. In 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of liquid crystalline columnar assembly of imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles under Xe atmosphere, the NMR signals of the Xe atoms entrapped in the liquid&#8208;crystalline macrocycle depended on the gas pressure and phase&#8208;transition temperatures. These results indicate that the encapsulation of Xe gas molecules within the discrete and oriented nanospaces of nanoporous liquid crystals is different from the homogeneous dissolution of the solute in an ordinary solution.

         <title>Soccer Ball&#8208;like Assembly of Edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge Oriented 2D&#8208;silica Nanosheets: A Promising Catalyst Support for High&#8208;Temperature Reforming</title>

2D&#8208;silica nanosheets undergo edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge oriented interlocking and self&#8208;assembly, resulting in the formation of spherical micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like hollow shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The mechanically robust SA&#8208;SiMS with their with internally open support architecture provide a maximally accessible surface area for embedded metal&#8208;catalysts for high&#8208;temperature methane reforming.







Abstract
Controlled assembly of nanoparticles into well&#8208;defined assembled architectures through precise manipulation of spatial arrangement and interactions allows the development of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored structures, hierarchical functionalities, and enhanced properties. Despite remarkable advancements, the controlled assembly of highly anisotropic 2Dnanosheets is significantly challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge connectivity compared to the abundant large faces. Innovative strategies are needed to unlock the full potential of 2D&#8208;nanomaterialsin self&#8208;assembled structures with distinct and desirable properties. This research unveils the discovery of controlled self&#8208;assembly of 2D&#8208;silica nanosheets (2D&#8208;SiNSs) into hollow micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The assembly is driven by the physical flexibility of the 2D&#8208;SiNSs and the differential electricdouble&#8208;layer charge gradient creating electrostatic bias on the edge and face regions. The resulting SA&#8208;SiMS structures exhibit high mechanical stability, even at high&#8208;temperatures, and exhibit excellent performance as catalyst support in the dry reforming of methane. The SA&#8208;SiMS structures facilitate improved mass transport, leading to enhanced reaction rates, while the thin silica shell prevents sintering of small catalyst nanocrystals, thereby preventing coke formation. This discovery sheds light on the controllable self&#8208;assembly of 2D nanomaterials and provides insights into the design and synthesis of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored properties.

         <title>Partially Ion&#8208;Paired Solvation Structure Design for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partially ion&#8208;paired solvation structure design is demonstrated that combines the beneficial characteristics of contact&#8208;ion pair (CIP) and solvent&#8208;separated ion pair (SSIP) structures. A facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anion/fluorinated co&#8208;solvent for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity, effectively expanding the operational capabilities of lithium batteries under extreme conditions.







Abstract
Achieving increased energy density under extreme operating conditions remains a major challenge in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an all&#8208;fluorinated ester&#8208;based electrolyte comprising partially fluorinated carboxylate and carbonate esters. This electrolyte exhibits temperature&#8208;resilient physicochemical properties and moderate ion&#8208;paired solvation, leading to a half solvent&#8208;separated and half contact&#8208;ion pair in a sole electrolyte. As a result, facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anions/fluorinated co&#8208;solvents for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). These advantageous features were found to apply to both lithium metal and sulfur&#8208;based electrodes even under extreme operating conditions, allowing stable cycling of Li&#8201;||&#8201;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) full cells with high SPAN loading (&gt;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) at &#8722;40, 23 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a promising path for designing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes to support high energy density Li metal batteries operating in extreme conditions.

         <title>Enhanced Methanol Synthesis over Self&#8208;Limited ZnOx Overlayers on Cu Nanoparticles Formed via Gas&#8208;Phase Migration Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn species evaporated from ZnO particles can migrate and deposit onto Cu surface to form Zn oxide (ZnOx) encapsulation layers i.e., strong metal&#8208;support interaction state under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C in ZnO||Cu catalyst. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species and growth of ZnOx overlayer on Cu surface is self&#8208;limited, which constructs an optimal number of ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites to have enhanced methanol synthesis activity.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are widely used for chemical conversion, in which construction of high density metal&#8208;oxide or oxide&#8208;metal interface is an important means to improve their reaction performance. Here, Cu@ZnOx encapsulation structure has been in situ constructed through gas&#8208;phase migration of Zn species from ZnO particles onto surface of Cu nanoparticles under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species onto the Cu surface and growth of ZnOx overlayer is self&#8208;limited under the high temperature and redox gas (CO2/H2) conditions. Accordingly, high density ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites can be effectively tailored to have an enhanced activity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. This work reveals a new route for the construction of active oxide&#8208;metal interface and classic strong metal&#8208;support interaction state through gas&#8208;phase migration of support species induced by high temperature redox reaction atmosphere.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for the Selective Functionalization of Carbon Nanodots Allow Optically Communicating Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) were employed as building blocks for crafting optical communicating assemblies. This approach relies on the selective functionalization of CNDs with clickable moieties and their subsequent controlled interconnection. This work provides new insights on the link between molecular and nanoscale events, paving the way to develop selective and addressable CNDs that can act as modular nanoscale synthons.







Abstract
The surface of Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) stands as a rich chemical platform, able to regulate the interactions between particles and external species. Performing selective functionalization of these nanoscale entities is of practical importance, however, it still represents a considerable challenge. In this work, we exploited the organic chemistry toolbox to install target functionalities on the CND surface, while monitoring the chemical changes on the material's outer shell through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Following this, we investigated the use of click chemistry to covalently connect CNDs of different nature en&#8208;route towards covalent suprastructures with unprecedent molecular control. The different photophysical properties of the connected particles allowed their optical communication in the excited state. This work paves the way for the development of selective and addressable CND building blocks which can act as modular nanoscale synthons that mirror the long&#8208;established reactivity of molecular organic synthesis.

         <title>A donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymer for fast storage of anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer is reported, showing narrower band gap and higher electrical conductivity than its counterparts monopolymers and therefore excellent rate performance. Our findings provide a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials have attracted a lot interest in batteries in recent years. However, most of them still suffer from low performance such as low electrode potential, slow reaction kinetics, and short cycle life. In this work, we report a strategy of fabricating donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers for facilitating the charge transfer and therefore accelerating the reaction kinetics by using the copolymer (p&#8208;TTPZ) of dihydrophenazine (PZ) and thianthrene (TT) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The D&#8211;A conjugated polymer as p&#8208;type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82&#8197;V, 3.16&#8197;V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;50&#8197;C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8211;A structure. As a result, the p&#8208;TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26&#8197;V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.

         <title>Adaptive and Ultrahigh&#8208;Affinity Recognition in Water by Sulfated Conjugated Corral[5]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new water&#8208;soluble corral&#8208;shaped conjugated host bearing ten sulfate groups at its two rims&#8212;namely, SC[5]A&#8212;was synthesized. SC[5]A not only exhibited ultrahigh binding affinities (up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards a series of rod&#8208;shaped substrates, but also effectively bound (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) a wide range of functional substrates. Additionally, the application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide was explored.







Abstract
The pursuit of synthetic receptors with high binding affinities has long been a central focus in supramolecular chemistry, driven by their significant practical relevance in various fields. Despite the numerous synthetic receptors that have been developed, most exhibit binding affinities in the micromolar range or lower. Only a few exceptional receptors achieve binding affinities exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1, and their substrate scopes remain rather limited. In this context, we introduce SC[5]A, a conjugated corral&#8208;shaped macrocycle functionalized with ten sulfate groups. Owing to its deep one&#8208;dimensional confined hydrophobic cavity and multiple sulfate groups, SC[5]A displays an extraordinarily high binding strength of up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards several size&#8208;matched, rod&#8208;shaped organic dications in water. Besides, its conformation exhibits good adaptability, allowing it to encapsulate a wide range of other guests with diverse molecular sizes, shapes, and functionalities, exhibiting relatively strong affinities (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). Additionally, we've explored the preliminary application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination of ultrahigh binding affinities (towards complementary guests) and adaptive recognition capability (towards a wide range of functional guests) of SC[5]A positions it as exceptionally valuable for numerous practical applications.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Pyrrole&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic RTP Material for Persistent Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) nano&#8208;probes with long emission wavelength faces challenges. In this work, organic RTP materials with near&#8208;infrared emission have been designed and cell membrane encapsulation has been used to optimize the nanomaterial process, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and imaging penetration depth.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials offer remarkable advantages in bioimaging due to their characteristic time scales and background noise elimination. However, developing near&#8208;infrared RTP materials for deep tissue imaging still faces challenges since the small band gap may increase the non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in weak emission and short phosphorescence lifetime. In this study, fused&#8208;ring pyrrole&#8208;based structures were employed as the guest molecules for the construction of long wavelength emissive RTP materials. Compared to the decrease of the singlet energy level, the triplet energy level showed a more effectively decrease with the increase of the conjugation of the substituent groups. Moreover, the sufficient conjugation of fused ring structures in the guest molecule suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons. Therefore, a near&#8208;infrared RTP material (764&#8197;nm) was achieved for deep penetration bioimaging. Tumor cell membrane is used to coat RTP nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid decreasing the RTP performance compared to traditional coating by amphiphilic surfactants. RTP NPs with tumor&#8208;targeting properties show favorable phosphorescent properties, superior stability, and excellent biocompatibility. These NPs are applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging to eliminate background interference with excellent tissue penetration. This study provides a practical solution to prepare long&#8208;wavelength and long&#8208;lifetime organic RTP materials and their applications in bioimaging.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;End Functionalized Polydienes: Allylic&#8208;Bearing Heteroleptic Aluminums for Selective Alkylation and Transalkylation in Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy has been developed for preparation of polydienes with high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and end&#8208;group functionalization efficiency. This approach utilizes a novel catalytic system in which allylic&#8208;Al moiety exhibits remarkable selectivity for alkylation and transalkylation and improves the end&#8208;group functionality efficiency for polydiene synthesis, showcasing its immense potential for development of advanced polymeric materials.







Abstract
There are still challenges in the preparation of difunctional stereoregular polydienes, especially for the construction of initiating chain&#8208;end functionalization. Coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) provides a way to achieve the goal but usually requires sophisticated functionalized catalysts as well as expensive chain transfer agents (CTAs). In this work, heteroleptic aluminum with oligo(dienyl) substituents (oligo&#8208;Al agents) were readily prepared by living anionic polymerization (LAP) technique. The oligo&#8208;Al agents used in Nd&#8208;mediated CCTPs of dienes exhibit highly selective alkylation and transalkylation features. Kinetics and transfer efficiency studies using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and Dosy NMR analyses revealed that the resulting polydienes possess substituents at the initiating chain&#8208;end that have transferred from the oligo&#8208;Al agents. The functionalization efficiency of the initiating chain&#8208;end is up to 99&#8201;%, and the molar mass regulation efficiency of heteroleptic aluminum is higher than that of the traditional CTA AliBu2H (0.608 vs. 0.410). Based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which allylic&#8208;Al acts as an efficient alkylating moiety in catalyst preformation and also as an effective transfer agent in polymerization. Taking advantage of these features, di&#8208;functionalized polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and poly(isoprene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) can be facilely synthesized.

         <title>Chemical Engineering of Artificial Transcription Factors by Orthogonal Palladium(II)&#8208;Mediated S&#8208;Arylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal palladium(II) strategy is reported for the site&#8208;selective editing of multiple cysteine residues in peptides and proteins. The power of this approach was demonstrated by the preparation of complex and uniquely modified proteins. The reported palladium(II) chemistry enables rapid and controlled protein editing, opening new avenues to engineer novel biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well&#8208;defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, cysteine&#8208;based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond formation and C&#8722;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites (3&#8211;6 residues) with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogues, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity. Our approach enables rapid and effective protein editing and opens new avenues to engineer new biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic Derived from a Calcium&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side&#8208;chain carboxylates of Asp1 and Asp7 in laspartomycin coordinate with a calcium cation to adopt the active conformation. When these residues were replaced by serine, calcium dependence was eliminated and the resulting synthetic analogue depended instead on phenylboronic acid for its antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
The prevalence of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens foreshadows a healthcare crisis. Calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics (CDAs) are promising candidates to combat infectious diseases as many of them show modes of action (MOA) orthogonal to widespread resistance mechanisms. The calcium dependence is nonetheless one of the hurdles toward realizing their full potential. Using laspartomycin C (LspC) as a model, we explored the possibility of reducing, or even eliminating, its calcium dependence. We report herein a synthetic LspC analogue (B1) whose activity no longer depends on calcium and is instead induced by phenylboronic acid (PBA). In LspC, Asp1 and Asp7 coordinate to calcium to anchor it in the active conformation; these residues are replaced by serine in B1 and condense with PBA to form a boronic ester with the same anchoring effect. Using thin&#8208;layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrate that B1 inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC, i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate. B1 is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron&#8208;dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spatially&#8211;Temporally Synchronized Construction of Robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of constructing spatially&#8211;temporally synchronized (STS) robust solid&#8211;slectrolyte interphases (SEI) in aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries through synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction was proposed. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI protective layer enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemming from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) makes the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes beyond the thermodynamics limitation of water. However, achieving the energetic and robust SEI is more challenging in aqueous electrolytes because the low SEI formation efficiency (SFE) only contributed from anion&#8208;reduced products, and the low SEI formation quality (SFQ) negatively impacted by the hydrogen evolution, resulting in a high Li loss to compensate for SEI formation. Herein, we propose a highly efficient strategy to construct Spatially&#8208;Temporally Synchronized (STS) robust SEI by the involvement of synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It is worth highlighting that the Li3PO4 formation does not extra&#8208;consume lithium derived from the cathode but makes good use of the product of HER (OH&#8722;), prompting the SEI to achieve 100&#8201;% SFE and pushing the HER potential into &#8722;1.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. This energetic and robust SEI offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Dienyl Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of dienyl sulfoxides were accomplished with up to 98&#8201;% ee from both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters employing cheap Ni(II) as precatalyst. Experimental and computational methods revealed an interesting associated outersphere mechanism which is uncommon in transition metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic nucleophilic substitution reactions.







Abstract
Sulfoxides are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this structural motif remains limited. In this study, we disclosed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent reaction that utilizes both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters. Our method employs cheap and more sustainable Ni(II) as a precatalyst and successfully overcomes the challenging poisoning effect and instability of sulfenate generated in situ. This enables the synthesis of a series of dienyl sulfoxides with enantioselectivity of up to 98&#8201;% ee. The product exhibits tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aniline Derivatives via Palladium/ S,O&#8208;Ligand/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated anilines are directly synthesised via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand/norbornene cooperative catalysis without the need for additional synthetic steps. This method can be applied to a wide variety of aniline derivatives to provide a unique method for their direct meta&#8208;arylation. The isolation of several Pd complexes provides some useful insights into the factors influencing the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are ubiquitous moieties in organic molecules and their direct functionalization is of great interest in many research areas due to their prevalence in pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. While several synthetic tools exist for the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of anilines, the functionalization of the less reactive meta&#8208;position is not easy to achieve with current methods. To date, the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aniline derivatives has been restricted to either the use of directing groups &amp; templates, or their transformation into anilides &amp; quaternary anilinium salts. Herein, we report the first general and efficient meta&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;arylation of non&#8208;directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O&#8208;ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8211;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8211;reveal useful insights into the substituent&#8208;effects of both the aniline&#8208;substrate and the norbornene&#8208;mediator during the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.

         <title>Quantitative Construction of Boronic&#8208;Ester Linkages in Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable numbers of B atoms in the linkages have first been achieved to construct the catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction. The COFs with high contents of the B atoms showed improved the activity and selectivity, due to more easily formation of the intermediate COOH*.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been utilized for catalyzing the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) due to their atomic metal centers and controllable pore channels, which are facilitated by different covalent bonds. However, the exploration of boron&#8208;based linkages in these catalytic COFs has been limited owing to potential instability. Herein, we present the construction of boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs through nucleophilic substitution reactions in order to catalyze the CO2RR. The inclusion of abundant fluorine atoms within the frameworks enhances their hydrophobicity and subsequently improves water tolerance and chemical stability of COFs. The content of boron atoms in the COF linkages was carefully controlled, with COFs featuring a higher density of boron atoms exhibiting increased electronic conductivity, enhanced reductive ability, and stronger binding affinity towards CO2. Consequently, these COFs demonstrate improved activity and selectivity. The optimized COFs achieve the highest activity, achieving a turnover frequency of 1695.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. Operando synchrotron radiation measurements confirm the stability of Co (II) atoms as catalytically active sites. By successfully constructing boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs, we not only address potential instability concerns but also achieve exceptional catalytic performance for CO2RR.

         <title>Li6E5Li6: Tetrel Sandwich Complexes with 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a series of tetrel sandwich complexes characterized by ten &#960;&#8208;electrons ([Li6]5+[E5]10&#8722;[Li6]5+). These complexes are both thermochemically and kinetically stable and exhibit &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
When (4n +2) &#960;&#8208;electrons are located in single planar ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;&#8208;electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report a series of D5h&#8197;Li6E5Li6 sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;&#8208;electrons E510&#8722; ring (E=Si&#8722;Pb). However, these &#960;&#8208;electrons localize as five &#960;&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 Electrolytes for High&#8208;energy All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates are proposed as a groundbreaking platform for high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Benefiting from rational structure design, Li3PW12O4o electrolytes exhibit remarkable cost&#8208;effectiveness ($5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1), electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity (0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The lithium&#8208;metal batteries utilizing sustainable electrolyte achieve more than 200 cycles and the lithium&#8208;air batteries operate over 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries promise both high energy density and safety while existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Herein, novel polyoxometalate SSEs, Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40, are synthesized, which exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility with electrodes and chemical stability, overcoming the limitations of conventional SSEs. A high ionic conductivity of 0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.23&#8197;eV are obtained due to the optimized three&#8208;dimensional Li+ migration network of Li3PW12O40. Li3PW12O40 exhibits a wide window of electrochemical stability that can both accommodate the Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. As a result, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries fabricated with Li/Li3PW12O40/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 display a stable cycling up to 100 cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35&#8197;V and an areal capacity of more than 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as a cost&#8208;competitive SSEs price of $5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, Li3PMo12O40 homologous to Li3PW12O40 was obtained via isomorphous substitution, which formed a low&#8208;resistance interface with Li3PW12O40. Applications of Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 in Li&#8208;air batteries further demonstrate that long cycle life (650 cycles) can be achieved. This strategy provides a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy to construct efficient and scalable solid polyoxometalate electrolytes for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

     alt="Polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 Electrolytes for High-energy All-solid-state Lithium Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyoxometalates are proposed as a groundbreaking platform for high-energy all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries. Benefiting from rational structure design, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4o&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes exhibit remarkable cost-effectiveness ($5.68&#8197;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity (0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The lithium-metal batteries utilizing sustainable electrolyte achieve more than 200 cycles and the lithium-air batteries operate over 600 cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium (Li) batteries promise both high energy density and safety while existing solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Herein, novel polyoxometalate SSEs, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PMo&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;, are synthesized, which exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility with electrodes and chemical stability, overcoming the limitations of conventional SSEs. A high ionic conductivity of 0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low activation energy of 0.23&#8197;eV are obtained due to the optimized three-dimensional Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration network of Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;.

As a result, all-solid-state Li metal batteries fabricated with Li/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;/LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; display a stable cycling up to 100 cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35&#8197;V and an areal capacity of more than 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as a cost-competitive SSEs price of $5.68&#8197;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a series of instantaneous rate experiments, flow chemistry can be used to collect differential kinetic profiles. The time taken to collect a profile becomes independent of the time it takes a reaction to reach completion. This effectively enables high throughput kinetic experimentation, where data can be collected faster than a reaction can run. The process can also probe catalytic stability, offering further mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time&#8208;series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small&#8208;scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90&#8197;hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500&#8197;hours in batch, an almost 40&#8208;fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Featuring Acyclic, Non&#8208;Adjacent 1,3&#8208;Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for synthesizing chiral 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters bearing non&#8208;adjacent, acyclic 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, a novel activation mode for gem&#8208;diborylalkanes in asymmetric catalysis has been uncovered, avoiding two potential side&#8208;products encountered when using classical conditions. This innovative approach exhibits excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of acyclic, non&#8208;adjacent 1,3&#8208;stereogenic centers, prevalent motifs in drugs and bioactive molecules, has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge due to acyclic nucleophiles being distant from the chiral environment. In this study, we successfully synthesized highly valuable 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters featuring acyclic and nonadjacent 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, this reaction selectively produces migratory coupling products rather than alternative deborylative allylation or direct allylation byproducts. This approach introduces a new activation mode for selective transformations of gem&#8208;diborylmethane in asymmetric catalysis. Additionally, we found that other gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, previously challenging due to steric hindrance, also successfully participated in this reaction. The incorporation of 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)alkenes facilitated the diversification of the alkenyl and two boron moieties in our target compounds, thereby enabling access to a broad array of versatile molecules. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and shed light on the factors responsible for the observed excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. These were determined to arise from ligand&#8208;substrate steric repulsions in the syn&#8208;addition transition state.

         <title>Rational Design and Reticulation of Infinite qbe Rod Secondary Building Units into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through a Global Desymmetrization Approach for Inverse C3H8/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker desymmetrization approach was used to fabricate infinite rod secondary building unit (SBU) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures carrying unique gfc net. The rod SBU can be simplified as 1&#8208;periodic cylindric sphere packing described in 1978 as 44 (3,3) and in the RCSR database as qbe, which has rarely been observed in MOF chemistry. The resulting MOF has nonpolar/inert pore surfaces and unusual inverse C3H8/C3H6 separation potential.







Abstract
The development of reticular chemistry has enabled the construction of a large array of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse net topologies and functions. However, dominating this class of materials are those built from discrete/finite secondary building units (SBUs), yet the designed synthesis of frameworks involving infinite rod&#8208;shaped SBUs remain underdeveloped. Here, by virtue of a global linker desymmetrization approach, we successfully targeted a novel Cu&#8208;MOF (Cu&#8208;ASY) incorporating infinite Cu&#8208;carboxylate rod SBUs with its structure determined by micro electron diffraction (MicroED) crystallography. Interestingly, the rod SBU can be simplified as a unique cylindric sphere packing qbe tubule made of [43.62] tiles, which further connect the tritopic linkers to give a newly discovered 3,5&#8208;connected gfc net. Cu&#8208;ASY is a permanent ultramicroporous material featuring 1D channels with highly inert surfaces and shows a preferential adsorption of propane (C3H8) over propene (C3H6). The efficiency of C3H8 selective Cu&#8208;ASY is validated by multicycle breakthrough experiments, giving C3H6 productivity of 2.2&#8197;L/kg. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that C3H8 molecules form multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and atypical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901; H&#8722;C van der Waals interactions with the inner nonpolar surfaces. This work therefore highlights the linker desymmetrization as an encouraging and intriguing strategy for achieving unique MOF structures and properties.

         <title>Revisiting the Paradigm of Reaction Optimization in Flow with a Priori Computational Reaction Intelligence</title>

To flow or not to flow ? Assessing feasibility and guiding chemists with a priori computational intelligence for reaction optimization under continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
The use of micro/meso&#8208;fluidic reactors has resulted in both new scenarios for chemistry and new requirements for chemists. Through flow chemistry, large&#8208;scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re&#8208;designing long&#8208;established batch processes to fit these new conditions. The reliance on experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to perform this translation frequently makes flow chemistry unaffordable, thwarting initial aspirations to revolutionize chemistry. By combining computational chemistry and machine learning, we have developed a model that provides predictive power tailored specifically to flow reactions. We show its applications to translate batch to flow, to provide mechanistic insight, to contribute reagent descriptors, and to synthesize a library of novel compounds in excellent yields after executing a single set of conditions.

Through flow chemistry, large-scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re-designing long-established batch processes to fit these new conditions.

Nanochannels with spatiotemporal continuity were found to exist in columnar liquid crystals composed of shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic molecules as reported by Kentaro Tanaka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316523). The results of 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of the liquid crystal under Xe atmosphere indicate the encapsulation of Xe gas atoms within the discrete and oriented nanochannels of the nanoporous liquid crystals.

Round and round The intrinsic dynamics of small&#8208;molecule ligands while bound to their protein targets is of interest for optimization of the entropic contributions to binding affinity. In their Communication (e202313947), Rasmus Linser et&#8197;al. show that NMR proton relaxation dispersion is able to capture an aromatic ring flip within a high&#8208;affinity pharmacological inhibitor on the &#181;s timescale.

Axially chiral azomethine imines were efficiently constructed through Cu&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closures of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides. Biological studies revealed that the (S)&#8208;atropisomer product effectively protects dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting oxaliplatin&#8208;induced apoptosis, while the (R)&#8208;atropisomer lacks protective effects, as described by Bo Han, Gu Zhan, Bo Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312663).

         <title>Nanofibers in Organelles: From Structure Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique stimuli in organelles could trigger in situ self&#8208;assembly of nanofibers with ordered structures, thus exhibiting differential influences on cells. In this minireview, we feature nanofibers in organelles, highlight their formation mechanism and triggering strategies, and discuss the biomedical applications and current challenges.







Abstract
Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self&#8208;assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous&#8208;forming units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the nanofibers assembled in organelles. This minireview discusses the formation mechanism, triggering strategies, and biomedical applications of nanofibers, which may facilitate the rational design of nanofibers, improve our understanding of the relationship between nanofiber properties and organelle characteristics, allow a comprehensive recognition of organelles affected by materials, and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of nanofibers.

Human&#8208;AI collaborative platform is described for synergistic design&#8208;synthesis&#8208;analysis workflow of SAHCs by integration of human&#8208;led atomistic insights with data&#8208;driven augmented toolbox towards accomplishing ultimate reality&#8208;enabled SAHCs manufacturing with atomic economy.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts with targeted functionality can be designed with atomic precision, but it is challenging to retain the structure and performance upon the scaled&#8208;up manufacturing. Particularly challenging is to ensure the &#8220;atomic economy&#8221;, where every catalytic site is most gainfully utilized. Given the emerging synergistic integration of human&#8208; and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven augmented designs (AD), augmented analytics (AA), and augmented reality manufacturing (AM) platforms, this minireview focuses on single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) and examines the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of translating atomic&#8208;level structural precision and data&#8208;driven discovery to next&#8208;generation industrial manufacturing. We critically examine the atomistic insights into structure&#8208;driven SAHCs functionality and discuss the opportunities and challenges on the way towards the synergistic human&#8208;AI collaborative data&#8208;driven platform capable of monitoring, analyzing, manufacturing, and retaining the atomic&#8208;scale structure and functions. Enhanced by the atomic&#8208;level AD, AA, and AM, evolving from the current high&#8208;throughput capabilities and digital materials manufacturing acceleration, this synergistic human&#8208;AI platform is promising to enable atom&#8208;efficient and atomically precise heterogeneous catalyst production.

         <title>Locally Ordered Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) exhibit remarkable potential in revolutionizing the limitations of SACs. To date, no review has comprehensively summarized this intriguing topic. This minireview focuses on the compelling characteristics, synthetic strategies, characterization methods, and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts manifest nearly 100&#8201;% atom utilization efficiency, well&#8208;defined active sites, and high selectivity. However, their practical applications are hindered by a low atom loading density, uncontrollable location, and ambiguous interaction with the support, thereby posing challenges to maximizing their electrocatalytic performance. To address these limitations, the ability to arrange randomly dispersed single atoms into locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) substantially influences the electronic effect between reactive sites and the support, the synergistic interaction among neighboring single atoms, the bonding energy of intermediates with reactive sites and the complexity of the mechanism. As such, it dramatically promotes reaction kinetics, reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, improves the performance of the catalyst and simplifies the reaction mechanism. In this review, firstly, we introduce a variety of compelling characteristics of LO&#8208;SACs as electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the synthetic strategies, characterization methods and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are discussed. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are elaborated to encourage further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Effects of Iron Species on Low Temperature CO2 Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;species will likely be present in large&#8208;scale systems, e.g. from steel components or contaminated electrolytes, so their role in low temperature CO2 electrolyzers must be understood. While they reportedly accelerate degradation of the polymer membrane and the CO2 reduction catalyst, they also enhance the oxygen evolution activity of catalysts. We use this duplicity to stress the need for holistic research of complex electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical energy conversion devices are considered key in reducing CO2 emissions and significant efforts are being applied to accelerate device development. Unlike other technologies, low temperature electrolyzers have the ability to directly convert CO2 into a range of value&#8208;added chemicals. To make them commercially viable, however, device efficiency and durability must be increased. Although their design is similar to more mature water electrolyzers and fuel cells, new cell concepts and components are needed. Due to the complexity of the system, singular component optimization is common. As a result, the component interplay is often overlooked. The influence of Fe&#8208;species clearly shows that the cell must be considered holistically during optimization, to avoid future issues due to component interference or cross&#8208;contamination. Fe&#8208;impurities are ubiquitous, and their influence on single components is well&#8208;researched. The activity of non&#8208;noble anodes has been increased through the deliberate addition of iron. At the same time, however, Fe&#8208;species accelerate cathode and membrane degradation. Here, we interpret literature on single components to gain an understanding of how Fe&#8208;species influence low temperature CO2 electrolyzers holistically. The role of Fe&#8208;species serves to highlight the need for considerations regarding component interplay in general.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Enzyme Cascades&#8212;Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.

     alt="Nucleic Acid-based Enzyme Cascades&#8212;Current Trends and Future Perspectives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural micro- and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron photocatalysis enables repurposing inexpensive trifluoroacetates as reagents for the C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Thanks to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere electron&#8208;transfer pathway, photodecarboxylation occurs under mild conditions and can be applied to complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.

         <title>Deconstructive Carboxylation of Activated Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;free photochemical method for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 is reported for the first time. The power of this strategy is demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives and the synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs.







Abstract
Carboxylation with carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one notable methodology to produce carboxylic acids. In contrast to carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, carbon&#8211;carbon bond cleavage for carboxylation with CO2 is far more challenging due to their inherent and less favorable orbital directionality for interacting with transition metals. Here we report a photocatalytic protocol for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to generate carboxylic acids in the absence of transition metals. It is emphasized that our protocol provides carboxylic acids with obviously unchanged carbon numbers when terminal alkenes were used. To show the power of this strategy, a variety of pharmaceutically relevant applications including the modular synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives are demonstrated.

         <title>Microsecond Timescale Conformational Dynamics of a Small&#8208;Molecule Ligand within the Active Site of a Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric motions of bound ligands contribute to the entropic changes upon binding but are difficult to detect via conventional methods. Here, Kotschy, S&#246;ldner et&#8197;al. develop solid&#8208;state NMR approaches focusing on the protons of the ligand to reveal an aromatic ring flip of the benzylic group of the inhibitor.







Abstract
The possible internal dynamics of non&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled small&#8208;molecule ligands inside a target protein is inherently difficult to capture. Whereas high crystallographic temperature factors can denote either static disorder or motion, even moieties with very low B&#8208;factors can be subject to vivid motion between symmetry&#8208;related sites. Here we report the experimental identification of internal &#956;s timescale dynamics of a high&#8208;affinity, natural&#8208;abundance ligand tightly bound to the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase&#8197;II (hCAII) even within a crystalline lattice. The rotamer jumps of the ligand's benzene group manifest themselves both, in solution and fast magic&#8208;angle spinning solid&#8208;state NMR 1H R1&#961; relaxation dispersion, for which we obtain further mechanistic insights from molecular&#8208;dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental confirmation of rotameric jumps in bound ligands within proteins in solution or the crystalline state may improve understanding of host&#8208;guest interactions in biology and supra&#8208;molecular chemistry and may facilitate medicinal chemistry for future drug campaigns.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;Diketones Catalyzed by Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 was accomplished under the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysis, delivering 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with &gt;99/1 dr values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities, while silane PhSiH3 facilitates an intramolecular hydrosilylation of the second carbonyl group.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of 1,2&#8208;diketones for the synthesis of optically active 1,2&#8208;diols, especially 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we describe the first highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 by using a chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst, giving a variety of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with excellent d.r. values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivites concurrently.

         <title>Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The beauty of one&#8208;pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine&#8208;promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

     alt="Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem-Difluoroalkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes under oxidant-free, acid-free and metal-free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl-olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one-pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of one-pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl-olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine-promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant-free, acid-free and metal-free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane Catalyzed Amide Enolization for Enantioselective Cyclohexadienone Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding saturated fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase catalyst and represents the first unactivated carboxamide deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective transformation.







Abstract
The organocatalytic enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding 3D fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation represents the first strong activating group&#8208;free activation of carboxamides via &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective reaction, and is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase.

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylboration of Alkenes Enabled by Dual Photoredox and Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a radical&#8208;based three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis. This protocol offers efficient access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency and reversed regioselectivity.







Abstract
A regioselectivity reversed three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis is reported. The mild conditions are compatible with a wide array of nonactivated trifluoromethyl aromatics bearing electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;neutral substituents, trifluoroacetamides, and various nonactivated terminal and internal alkenes, enabling straightforward access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency. Furthermore, this protocol is applicable to alkene&#8208;tethered trifluoromethyl aromatics to furnish gem&#8208;difluoromethylene&#8208;containing cyclic compounds. Synthetic applications and preliminary mechanistic studies are also presented.

A mechanochemical nitrene transfer reaction towards N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and dioxazolones with the catalysis of iron(II) chloride is presented. This one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;free procedure shows better conversions rate and chemoselectivity compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, providing a wide range of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides in up to 87&#8201;% yield.

Abstract
A mechanochemical synthesis of sulfonimidamides by iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed exogenous ligand&#8208;free N&#8208;acyl nitrene transfer to sulfinamides is reported. The one&#8208;step method tolerates a wide range of sulfinamides with various substituents under solvent&#8208;free ambient conditions. Compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, this mechanochemical approach shows better conversion and chemoselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles: A Straightforward Access to 3&#8208;Fluorinated Quinolines and Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources make one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of indoles and pyrroles facile, allowing for direct access to structurally diverse azines, especially the pharmaceutically important 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol features bench&#8208;stable reagents, a broad range of substrates, and good compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluorinated quinolines and pyridines are prevalent pharmacophores, yet their synthesis is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that dibromofluoromethane as bromofluorocarbene source enables the one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of readily available indoles and pyrroles to structurally diverse 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol requires only a short reaction time of ten minutes and can be performed under air atmosphere. Preliminary investigations reveal that this strategy can also be applied to the synthesis of other valuable azines by using different 1,1&#8208;dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources.

         <title>Speciation of Transition Metal Dissolution in Electrolyte from Common Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal ion dissolution from the cathode, migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the anode is one of the leading causes of cell failure when cycling lithium&#8208;ion batteries to high potentials (&gt;4.2&#8197;V). To better understand what is occurring in the electrolyte, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy was performed to determine the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni that has dissolved into the electrolyte from commonly used cathodes.







Abstract
Significant capacity loss has been observed across extended cycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries cycled to high potential. One of the sources of capacity fade is transition metal dissolution from the cathode active material, ion migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the anode. While much research has been conducted on the oxidation state of the transition metal in the cathode active material or deposited on the anode, there have been limited investigations of the oxidation state of the transition metal ions dissolved in the electrolyte. In this work, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials (LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), and (x Li2MnO3*(1&#8208;x) LiNiaMnbCocO2, with a+b+c=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.

In this work, X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials (LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LMO), LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LNMO), LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NMC811), and (x Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;*(1-x) LiNi&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with a+b+&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Preparation of Triarylboron&#8208;Based Graphdiyne Analogues for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDY) with clear structure and tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. Due to its rich microporous structure, the electron deficiency of the TAB group and the electron richness of the acetylene bond, TAB&#8208;GDY exhibits certain IAST selectivity in binary gas and is expected to be used for gas capture and separation.







Abstract
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDYs) with tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. The elemental composition, chemical bond, morphology of TAB&#8208;GDYs were well characterized. The crystallinity was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and stacking modes were studied in combination with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and structure simulation. The absorption and desorption isotherm revealed relatively high specific surface area of these TAB&#8208;GDYs up to 788&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 for TMTAB&#8208;GDY, which decreased as pore size enlarged. TAB&#8208;GDYs exhibit certain selectivity for CO2/N2 (21.9), CO2/CH4 (5.3), CO2/H2 (41.8) and C2H2/CO2 (2.3). This work has developed a series of boron containing two&#8208;dimensional frameworks with clear structures and good stability, and their tunable pore sizes have laid the foundation for future applications in the gas separation field.

         <title>Catalytic HF Shuttling between Fluoroalkanes and Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method to transfer formal equivalents of HF from fluoroalkanes to an alkyne is reported. The method leads to a simple approach generating geminal difluoroalkanes and it tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) was shown to act as an HF donor in place of the fluoroalkane.







Abstract
In this paper, we report BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 as a catalyst to shuttle equivalents of HF from a fluoroalkane to an alkyne. Reactions of terminal and internal aliphatic alkynes led to formation of difluoroalkane products, while diarylalkynes can be selectively converted into fluoroalkenes. The method tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps, with BF3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. In certain cases, the interconversion of fluoroalkene and difluoroalkane products was found to be reversible. The new catalytic system was applied to demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept recycling of poly(vinylidene difluoride).

         <title>&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Allylation of Trialkylamines with Allenes Promoted by Synergistic Borane/Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation reactions of trialkylamines with allenes were accomplished by a synergistic borane/palladium catalysis. The borane and palladium catalysts promoted the formation of an enamine intermediate from a trialkylamine and a palladium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate from an allene, respectively.







Abstract
Functionalization of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of trialkylamines is challenging, especially for reactions at positions other than the &#945; position. Herein, we report a method for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H allylation of trialkylamines. In these reactions, which involve synergistic borane/palladium catalysis, an enamine intermediate is first generated from the amine via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation promoted by B(C6F5)3 and a base, and then the enamine undergoes palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an allene to give the allylation product. Because the hydride and the proton resulting from the initial dehydrogenation are ultimately shuttled to the product by B(C6F5)3 and the palladium catalyst, respectively, these reactions show excellent atom economy. The establishment of this method paves the way for future studies of C&#8722;H functionalization of trialkylamines by means of synergistic borane/transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Deploying Cationic Cellulose Nanofiber Confinement to Enable High Iodine Loadings Towards High Energy and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;I2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed as a host to confine charged iodine species. The robust physicochemical adsorption between cCNF and polyiodides effectively mitigated the shuttle effect and increased iodine loading, resulting in enhanced cycling stability and high energy density even at elevated temperatures, thereby demonstrating promising performance at the full&#8208;battery level.







Abstract
High iodine loading and high&#8208;temperature adaptability of the iodine cathode are prerequisites to achieving high energy density at full battery level and promoting the practical application for the zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery. However, it would aggravate the polyiodide shuttle effect when employing high iodine loading and working temperature. Here, a sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed to confine the active iodine species through strong physiochemical adsorption to enlarge the iodine loading and stabilize it even at high temperatures. The cCNF could accommodate dual&#8208;functionality by enlarging the iodine loading and suppressing the polyiodide shuttle effect, owing to the unique framework structure with abundant surface positive charges. As a result, the iodine cathode based on the cCNF could deliver high iodine mass loading of 14.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a specific capacity of 182.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, high areal capacity of 2.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable cycling over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, thus enabling a high energy density of 34.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and the maximum power density of 521.2&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a full Zn&#8208;I2 battery level. In addition, even at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery could still deliver a stable cycling.

         <title>Pauling&#8208;Type Adsorption of O2 Induced by Heteroatom Doped ZnIn2S4 for Boosted Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds drastically hinder the H2O2 production performance. This work presents a strategy that atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production.







Abstract
Breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity has perennially been a formidable endeavor in the field of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, especially the side&#8208;on configuration of oxygen (O2) on the catalyst surface will cause the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds, which drastically hinders the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we present an atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 catalyst with tunable oxygen adsorption configuration to accelerate the ORR kinetics essential for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Indeed, the spectroscopy characterizations (such as EXAFS and in situ FTIR) and DFT calculations reveal that heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production. As a result, the oxygen adsorption configuration is regulated from side&#8208;on (Yeager&#8208;type) to end&#8208;on (Pauling&#8208;type), resulting in the accelerated ORR kinetics from 874.94 to 2107.66&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This finding offers a new avenue toward strategic tailoring oxygen adsorption configuration by the rational design of doped photocatalyst.

         <title>Tuning CH Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Based Receptors toward Picomolar Anion Affinity via the Inductive Effect of Distant Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh binding affinity of bambusuril receptors toward halides is achieved and continuously increases with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing power of groups installed on its benzyl substituents, as measured by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, artificial hydrogen bond&#8208;based anion receptors have been developed to achieve high anion selectivity; however, their binding affinity is usually low. The potency of these receptors is usually increased by the introduction of aryl substituents, which withdraw electrons from their binding site through the resonance effect. Here, we show that the polarization of the C(sp3)&#8208;H binding site of bambusuril receptors, and thus their potency to bind anions, can be modulated by the inductive effect. The presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on benzyl substituents of bambusurils significantly increases their binding affinities to halides, resulting in the strongest iodide receptor reported to date with an association constant greater than 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. A Hammett plot showed that while the bambusuril affinity toward halides linearly increases with the electron&#8208;withdrawing power of their substituents, their binding selectivity remains essentially unchanged.

         <title>Metal Vapour Synthesis of an Organometallic Barium(0) Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For over half a century, Mg(anthracene) has been a well&#8208;known complex that reacts as a form of &#8220;atomic&#8221; Mg0, however, heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metal anthracene complexes are unknown. Reaction of Ba0 vapour with an anthracene ligand gave a Ba anthracene complex that crystallizes as a cyclic octamer and reacts as a Ba0 synthon.







Abstract
A hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble barium anthracene complex was prepared by means of metal vapour synthesis. Reaction of 9,10&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)anthracene (Anth&#8242;&#8242;) with barium vapour gave deep purple Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;) which after extraction with diethyl ether crystallised as the cyclic octamer [Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;Et2O]8. Dissolution in benzene or toluene led to replacement of the Et2O ligand with a softer arene ligand and isolation of Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;arene. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY&#8197;NMR ) measurements in benzene&#8208;d6 indicate solution species with a molecular weight that equals a trimeric constitution. Natural population analysis (NPA) assigned charges of +1.70 and &#8722;1.70 to Ba and Anth&#8242;&#8242;, respectively, relating to highly ionic Ba2+/Anth&#8242;&#8242;2&#8722; bonding. Preliminary reactivity studies with air, Ph2C=NPh, or H2 show that the complex reacts as a Ba0 synthon by release of neutral Anth&#8242;&#8242;. This soluble molecular Ba0/BaII redox synthon provides new routes for the syntheses of barium complexes under mild conditions.
