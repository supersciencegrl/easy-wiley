         <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Proton Rectifier Using a Heterogeneous Membrane Composed of Coordination Polymer and Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational control of unidirectional proton transport is highly challenging, primarily owing to the difficulty in introducing an asymmetric factor into proton conducting media. In this study, freestanding membranes of a proton&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional porous coordination polymer, Cu  2  (CuTCPP) (H  2  TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO  3  ), were combined to generate a pH gradient in the conducting media. The current&#8211;voltage measurements revealed that the heterogeneous membrane exhibits a significant unidirectional proton transport with a proton rectification ratio exceeding 200 under 90% relative humidity in the initial voltage scan. This value is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifiers. The high designability of both components with well&#8208;defined structures, which is in contrast to the organic polymers used so far, provides a new avenue for developing and understanding the protonrectifying behavior in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox&#8208;Coupled Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low&#8208;cost solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long&#8208;lived separated charges (&#964;ave. = 3.0 ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor&#8208;acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high&#8208;rate redox of &#8208;C=O/&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208; and &#8208;C&#8208;N/&#8208;C=N+ with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1% at 1 sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron&#8208;enriching &#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208; and hole&#8208;enriching &#8208;C=N+ groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn2+ and OTf&#8208; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed. This work presents an inspiring photoelectrochemical cathode design and theoretical insight for photoresponsive batteries.</dc:description>

These charges are further allowed to drive high-rate redox of -C=O/-C-O- and -C-N/-C=N+ with facile kinetics.

         <title>Edge&#8208;hosted Atomic Co&#8722;N4 Sites on Hierarchical Porous Carbon for Highly Selective Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Not only high efficiency but also high selectivity of the electrocatalysts is crucial for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we systematically investigate the edge effect of carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways (two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) or four&#8208;electron (4e&#8722;)), and conclude that the 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR proceeding over the edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co&#8722;N4  sites are more favorable than the basal&#8208;plane&#8208;hosted ones. As such, we have successfully synthesized and tuned Co&#8208;SACs with different edge&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratios. The as&#8208;prepared edge&#8208;rich Co&#8208;N/HPC catalyst exhibits excellent 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR performance with a remarkable selectivity of ~95% in a wide potential range. Furthermore, we also find that oxygen functional groups could saturate the graphitic carbon edges under the ORR operation and further promote electrocatalytic performance. These findings on the structure&#8208;property relationship in SACs offer a promising direction for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost electrochemical H2O2  production via the 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Ammonia Oxidation to Dinitrogen by a Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a nickel complex for catalytic oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen under ambient conditions. Using the aryloxyl radical 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylphenoxyl (   t   Bu  3  ArO  &#8226;  ) as H atom acceptor to cleave the N&#8208;H bond of a coordinated NH  3  ligand up to 56 equiv of N  2  per Ni center can be generated. Employing the  N  &#8208;oxyl radical 2,2,6,6&#8208;(tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO  &#8226;  ) as the H&#8208;atom acceptor, ~15 equiv of N  2  per Ni center are formed. A bridging Ni&#8208;hydrazine product identified by isotopic nitrogen (  15  N) studies and supported by computational models indicates the N&#8211;N bond forming step occurs by bimetallic homocoupling of two paramagnetic Ni&#8208;NH  2  fragments. Ni&#8208;mediated hydrazine disproportionation to N  2  and NH  3  completes the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>The Covalent Functionalization of Surface&#8208;Supported Graphene &#8208; An update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, the use of graphene supported on solid surfaces has broadened its scopes and applications, acquiring a promising role as a major component of high&#8208;performance electronic devices. In this context, the chemical modification of graphene has become essential. In particular, covalent modification offers key benefits, including controllability, stability, and the facility to be integrated into manufacturing operations. In this review, we critically comment on the latest advances in the covalent modification of supported graphene on substrates. We analyze the different chemical modifications with special attention to radical reactions. With this view, we have revised the last achievements in reactivity control, tailoring electronic properties, and introducing active functionalities. Finally, we have extended our analysis to other emerging 2D materials supported on surfaces, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, and elemental analogs of graphene. This review is an update of our previous article in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, 54,10734&#8211; 10750.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of a Au(I) Fluorido Complex into a N&#8208;Fluoroamido Derivative: N&#8211;F versus Au&#8211;N Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Au(I) complex [Au{N(F)SO2Ph}(SPhos)] (SPhos = dicyclohexyl(2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethoxy[1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphane) (2) bearing a fluoroamido ligand has been synthesized by reaction of the fluorido complex [Au(F)(SPhos)] (1) with NFSI (NFSI = N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide). A reaction with CO resulted in an unprecedented insertion into the N&#8211;F bond at 2. With the carbene precursor N2CH(CO2Et) N&#8211;F bond cleavage gave the Au&#8211;F bond insertion product [Au{CHF(CO2C2H5)}(SPhos)] (7). The presence of CNtBu led to Au&#8211;N cleavage at 2 and concomitant amide formation to give the cationic complex [Au(CNtBu)(SPhos)][N(F)SO2Ph)] (5), which reacted further to give FtBu as well as the cyanido complex [Au(CN)(SPhos)] (6). These results led to the development of a process for the amination of electrophilic organic substrates by transfer of the fluoroamido group NF(SO2Ph)&#8208;.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Stable Polymer&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Safe Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serious safety risks caused by the high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes severely hamper the practicability of lithium metal batteries. By introducing unique polymerization site and more fluoride substitution, we built an in&#8208;situ formed polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase upon lithium anode to improve battery safety. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer exhibits high thermal stability, which effectively reduces the continuous exothermic reaction between electrolyte and anode/cathode. As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0 Ah lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell can be increased from 143.2oC to 174.2oC. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0oC to 338.0oC. This work affords novel strategies upon electrolyte design, aiming to pave the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing MXene Electrocatalysts for Energy Conversion Reactions: Surface, Stoichiometry, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes, due to their tailorable chemistry and favourable physical properties, have great promise in electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions. To exploit fully their enormous potential, further advances specific to electrocatalysis revolving around their performance, stability, compositional discovery and synthesis are required. The most recent advances in these aspects are discussed in detail: surface functional and stochiometric modifications which can improve performance, Pourbaix stability related to their electrocatalytic operating conditions, density functional theory and advances in machine learning for their discovery, and prospects in large scale synthesis and solution processing techniques to produce membrane electrode assemblies and integrated electrodes. This minireview provides a perspective that is complemented by new density functional theory calculations which show how these recent advances in MXene material design are paving the way for effective electrocatalysts required for the transition to integrated renewable energy systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Blown Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For 80 years, polyisocyanates and polyols were central building blocks for the industrial fabrication of polyurethane (PU) foams. By their partial hydrolysis, isocyanates release CO  2  that expands the PU network. Substituting this toxic isocyanate&#8208;based chemistry by a more sustainable variant &#8211; that  in&#8208;situ  forms CO  2  by hydrolysis of a comonomer &#8208; is urgently needed for producing greener cellular materials. Herein, we report a facile, up&#8208;scalable process, potentially compatible to existing infrastructures, to rapidly prepare water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) foams. We show that formulations composed of poly(cyclic carbonate)s and polyamines furnish rigid or flexible NIPU foams by partial hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates in the presence of a catalyst. By utilizing readily available low cost starting materials, this simple but robust process gives access to greener PU foams, expectedly responding to the sustainability demands of many sectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectro&#8208;Microscopic Techniques for Studying Nanoplastics in the Environment and in Organisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoplastics (NPs), small (&lt; 1 &#181;m) polymer particles formed from bulk plastics, are a potential threat to human health and the environment. Orders of magnitude smaller than microplastics (MPs), they might behave different due to their larger surface area and small size, which allows them to diffuse through organic barriers. However, detecting NPs in the environment and organic matrices has proven to be difficult, as their chemical nature is similar to these matrices. Furthermore, as their size is smaller than the (spatial) detection limit of common analytic tools, they are hard to find and quantify. Here, we highlight different micro&#8208;spectroscopic techniques utilized for NP detection and argue that an analysis procedure should involve both particle imaging and correlative or direct chemical characterization of the same particles or samples. Finally, we highlight methods that can do both simultaneously, but have as downside that large particle numbers and statistics cannot be obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstructed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Heterojunction for Switchable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability simultaneously is highly required yet very challenging due to the limited intrinsic activity and their elusive evolution under harsh OER conditions. Herein, a steady self&#8208;reconstructed MOF heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy. Thanks to the inhibiting effect from hydrogen bonds of Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;1 (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid), the obatained MOF heterojunction shows greatly improved OER activity with low overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, relative to the totally reconstructed Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;3 (332 mV). Density function theory calculations reveal that the formed built&#8208;in electric field in the MOF heterojunction remarkably optimizes the ad/desorption free energy of active Ni sites. Moreover, such MOF heterojunction shows superior durability attributed to the shielding effect of the surface&#8208;evolved NiOOH coating.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols and their derivatives are ubiquitous and versatile motifs in organic synthesis. Deoxygenative transformations of these compounds are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8211;O bond. However, electrochemically driven redox events have been shown to facilitate the C&#8211;O bond cleavage in alcohols and their derivatives either through direct electron transfer or through the use of electron transfer mediators and electroactive catalysts. Herein, a comprehensive overview of preparative electrochemically mediated protocols for C&#8211;O bond activation and functionalization is detailed, including direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable Nickel&#8208;Iron (Oxy)hydroxide&#160;Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts through Surface Functionalization with Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;based oxides are one of the best&#8208;known active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, they rapidly lost performance in Fe&#8208;purified KOH during the reaction. Herein, tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) was loaded on a catalyst/electrolyte interface to alleviate the destabilization of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide. We propose that the degradation occurs primarily due to the release of thermodynamically unstable Fe. TPP acts as a protective layer and suppresses the dissolution of hydrated metal at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. In the electric double layer, the nonpolar TPP layer on the NiFe surface also invigorates the redeposition of the active site, Fe, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of NiFe. The TPP&#8208;coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126&#160;L h&#8208;1 for 115 h at a 1.41 mV h&#8208;1 degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen&#8208;centered cascade exchange chemistry is increasingly understood to account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, that is, the ability of reversibly thiol&#8208;reactive agents to penetrate cells.&#160; Here, reversible Michael acceptors are shown to enable and inhibit thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, including the cytosolic delivery of proteins.&#160; Dynamic cyano&#8208;cinnamate dimers rival the best chalcogen&#8208;centered inhibitors.&#160; Patterns generated in inhibition heatmaps reveal contributions from halogen&#8208;bonding switches that occur independent from the thyroid transporter MCT8.&#160; The uniqueness of these patterns supports that the entry of tetrel&#8208;centered exchangers into cells differs from chalcogen&#8208;centered systems. &#160;These results expand the chemical space of thiol&#8208;mediated uptake and support the existence of a universal exchange network to bring matter into cells, abiding to be decoded for drug delivery and drug discovery in the broadest sense.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Ultralong Afterglow Emission with Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching from CsCdCl3:Mn Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet exciton&#8208;based long&#8208;lived phosphorescence is severely limited by the thermal quenching at high temperature. Herein, we propose a novel strategy based on the energy transfer from triplet self&#8208;trapped excitons to Mn2+ dopants in solution&#8208;processed perovskite CsCdCl3. It is found the Mn2+ doped hexagonal phase CsCdCl3 could simultaneously exhibit high emission efficiency (81.5%) and long afterglow duration time (150 s). Besides, the afterglow emission exhibits anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400 K. In&#8208;depth charge&#8208;carrier dynamics studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculation provide unambiguous evidence that carrier detrapping from trap states (mainly induced by Cl vacancy) to localized emission centers ([MnCl6]4&#8208;) is responsible for the afterglow emission with anti&#8208;thermal quenching. Enlightened by the present results, we demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Pulse Induced One&#8208;step Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pt on Oxide Clusters for Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed sites anchored on small oxide clusters are attractive new catalytic materials. Herein, we demonstrate an electrical pulse approach to synthesize atomically dispersed Pt on various oxide clusters in one step with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as the support (Pt1&#8208;MOx/CN). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Pt1&#8208;FeOx/CN is shown to exhibit high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94 V vs RHE, in contrast to the poor catalytic performance of atomically dispersed Pt on large Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Our work has revealed that, by tuning the size of the iron oxide down to the cluster regime, an optimal OH* adsorption strength for ORR is achieved on Pt1&#8208;FeOx/CN due to the regulation of Pt&#8208;O bonds. The unique structure and high catalytic performance of Pt1&#8208;FeOx/CN enable the Zinc&#8208;Air batteries an excellent performance at ultralow temperature of &#65293;40 &#176;C with a high peak power density of 45.1 mW cm&#8208;2 and remarkable cycling stability up to 120 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;like Charge Transport in PEDOT(OH) Films by Post&#8208;processing Side Chain Removal from a Soluble Precursor Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a route to produce highly electrically conductive doped hydroxymethyl functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films, termed PEDOT(OH) with metallic charge transport properties using a fully solution processable precursor polymer is reported. This is achieved via an ester&#8208;functionalized PEDOT derivative [PEDOT(EHE)] that is soluble in a range of solvents with excellent film&#8208;forming ability. PEDOT(EHE) demonstrates moderate electrical conductivities of 20&#8208;60 S cm  &#8208;1  and hopping&#8208;like (  i.e.,  thermally activated) transport when doped with ferric tosylate (FeTos  3  ). Upon basic hydrolysis of PEDOT(EHE) films, the electrically insulative side chains are cleaved and washed from the polymer film, leaving a densified film of PEDOT(OH). These films, when optimally doped, reach electrical conductivities of ~1200 S cm  &#8208;1  and demonstrate metallic (  i.e.,  thermally deactivated and band&#8208;like) transport properties and high stability at comparable doping levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the Distance of Adjacent Palladium Atoms for Configuration Matching in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely tailoring distance between adjacent metal sites to match adsorption configurations of key species for the targeted reaction pathway is a great challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on the atomically sites&#8208;tailored pathway in Pd catalyzed acetylene hydrogenation, i.e., increasing the distance of adjacent Pd atoms (i.e., dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd) for configuration matching in acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against coupling. The dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd is identified as a structural descriptor for describing the competitiveness for reaction pathways, and the increased dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd prefers to semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway due to simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and destabilized transition state of C2H3* coupling. Spectroscopic, kinetics and electronic structure studies reveal that increasing dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd to 3.31 &#197; delivers superior selectivity and stability, due to matched energetics scenarios and appropriate hybridization of Pd 4d with In 2s and, especially, 2p orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead&#8208;Tin Bromide with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with perfect host&#8208;guest structures are promising candidates to construct circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. However, it still remains challenging to obtain 0D chiral metal halides with simultaneously strong CPL and high photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, a new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#183;2H2O (R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O), is reported. The R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O compounds not only show intriguing self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, but also present intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177; 3.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Such CPL activities originate from the asymmetric [SnBr6]4&#8722; luminophores in R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O, due to the induced structural chirality by the organic ligands via N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, CPL emissions with tunable colors from R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O and dehydrated compounds are reversibly observed, which extends their chiroptical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions

         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions without exogenous photocatalysts were realized using a nickel catalyst that was activated through intraligand charge transfer. Ligand polymerization afforded a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.







Abstract
We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;coupling reactions follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.

         <title>Selective Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Azaarenes and Alkynes via Photoredox Cobalt Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed to access functionalized araarene compounds bearing stereodefined tri&#8208;substituted alkenes via photoredox cobalt dual catalysis. Simple organic base together with alcohol has been applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this coupling reaction.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;induced Co&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed. Notably, H&#252;nig's base together with simple ethanol has been successfully applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this catalytic photoredox reaction. This approach has considerable advantages for the straightforward synthesis of stereodefined multiple substituted alkenes bearing an azaarene motif, such as excellent regioselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 for &gt;30&#8197;examples) and stereoselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;E/Z), broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility under mild reaction conditions, which has been utilized in the concise synthesis of natural product monomorine I. A reasonable catalytic reaction pathway involving protolysis of the cobaltacyclopentene intermediate has been proposed based on the mechanistic studies.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls via Enantioselective Ullmann Coupling of ortho&#8208;Chlorinated Aryl Aldehydes Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is a general and highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aldehydes enabled by a SBpy&#8208;type chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand. This mild and step&#8208;economical approach allowed the synthesis of various axially chiral biaryl dials, as well as provided the versatile intermediates for diverse axially chiral catalysts, ligands as well natural products.







Abstract
The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective reductive Ullmann coupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aryl aldehyde was achieved under mild reaction conditions with a chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (+)&#8208;DTB&#8208;SBpy, thus providing axially chiral biphenyl or binaphthyl dials with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5:0.5 er. The versatility of the products as common synthetic intermediates for diverse axially chiral ligands, catalysts, and functional molecules was demonstrated by short&#8208;step transformations. This protocol also allowed the concise and highly enantioselective formal total synthesis of biologically active natural products (+)&#8208;kotanin, (&#8722;)&#8208;isoschizandrin and (+)&#8208;gossypol.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl Thianthrenium Salts with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide at room temperature has been developed. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation, this work provides an efficient site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation method, which may be used in the late&#8208;stage carboxylation modification of drug molecules.







Abstract
Carboxyl group is one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Herein, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide (CO2) at room temperature has been developed. The reaction employs low loading of cuprous chloride catalyst under 1&#8197;atm CO2 and exhibits good functional group tolerance. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation of aromatic hydrocarbons, this work provides an efficient method for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It may serve as a significant late&#8208;stage carboxylation tool for the modification of drug molecules in the future.

         <title>Block Poly(carbonate&#8208;ester) Ionomers as High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;esters) were designed that undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization in the polycarbonate rubbery mid&#8208;segment and are reinforced by reversible ionic interactions in the outer semi&#8208;aromatic polyester blocks. The thermoplastic elastomers show impressive tensile strength, high elastic recovery and are degradable in aqueous alkali media or chemically recyclable to monomer.







Abstract
Thermoplastic elastomers based on polyesters/carbonates have the potential to maximize recyclability, degradability and renewable resource use. However, they often underperform and suffer from the familiar trade&#8208;off between strength and extensibility. Herein, we report well&#8208;defined reprocessable poly(ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester) elastomers with impressive tensile strengths (60&#8197;MPa), elasticity (&gt;800&#8201;%) and recovery (95&#8201;%). Plus, the ester/carbonate linkages are fully degradable and enable chemical recycling. The superior performances are attributed to three features: (1)&#8197;Highly entangled soft segments; (2)&#8197;Fully reversible strain&#8208;induced crystallization and (3)&#8197;Precisely placed ZnII&#8208;carboxylates dynamically crosslinking the hard domains. The one&#8208;pot synthesis couples controlled cyclic monomer ring&#8208;opening polymerization and alternating epoxide/anhydride ring&#8208;opening copolymerization. Efficient convresion to ionomers is achieved by reacting vinyl&#8208;epoxides to install ZnII&#8208;carboxylates.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Activation: Strategic Approaches towards Realizing the Full Potential of C&#8722;H Activation in Sustainable Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of silver additives has enabled many highly valuable synthetic methods in the field of C&#8722;H activation. However, such additives are disadvantageous with respect to sustainability, scalability, and economic considerations. This Review provides a systematic overview of strategic approaches towards developing silver&#8208;free protocols based on the mechanistic role of silver.

The activation of carbon&#8722;hydrogen bonds is considered as one of the most attractive techniques in synthetic organic chemistry because it bears the potential to shorten synthetic routes as well as to produce complementary product scopes compared to traditional synthetic strategies. However, many current methods employ silver salts as additives, leading to stoichiometric metal waste and thereby preventing the full potential of C&#8722;H activation to be exploited. Therefore, the development of silver&#8208;free protocols has recently received increasing attention. Mechanistically, silver can serve various roles in C&#8722;H activation and thus, avoiding the use of silver requires different approaches based on the role it serves in a given process. In this Review, we present the comparison of silver&#8208;based and silver&#8208;free methods. Focusing on the strategic approaches to develop silver&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation, we provide the reader with the means to develop sustainable methods for C&#8722;H activation.

&lt;p&gt;The use of silver additives has enabled many highly valuable synthetic methods in the field of C&#8722;H activation. However, such additives are disadvantageous with respect to sustainability, scalability, and economic considerations. This Review provides a systematic overview of strategic approaches towards developing silver-free protocols based on the mechanistic role of silver.

         <title>Highly Controllable Nanoassemblies of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Abnormal Disassembly&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement for In Vivo Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abnormal disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (&gt;6 folds, with quantum yields (QYs) as high as 12&#8201;%) is observed from the water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with highly redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm and QYs of 1.8&#8201;%. The nanoassemblies are fabricated through a facile and feasible method using a unique Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si crosslinking strategy in solution.







Abstract
Assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been widely observed for luminophors but it causes emission decrease after disassembly. The construction of unique nanoassemblies with disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (DIEE) is demanded. Herein, by taking advantages of alterable siloxane bridge crosslinking states, we report a facile strategy to fabricate water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with abnormal DIEE. The fabricated AuNP nanoassemblies with dominant interparticle crosslinking showed a redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm with quantum yields (QYs) of 1.8&#8201;%. After disassembly, the nanoassemblies with increased intraparticle crosslinking exhibited a unique DIEE (&gt;6 folds, QYs, 12&#8201;%) due to the enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition. Besides, the disassembly facilitated renal clearance of AuNPs to reduce nonspecific retention in the body, opening new possibilities for designing highly emissive renal&#8208;clearable nanostructures toward more bioapplications.

         <title>Aryl Fluorosulfate Based Inhibitors That Covalently Target the SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SuFEx warheads installed into a previously developed inhibitor scaffold that targets the sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) deacylase, furnishes covalently labeling inhibitors that pull down the enzyme from cells and tissue. With further optimimization of the compound's potencies, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may provide the foundation for development of highly efficient covalent chemical probes and/or drug lead compounds targeting SIRT5.







Abstract
The sirtuin enzymes are a family of lysine deacylases that regulate gene transcription and metabolism. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) hydrolyzes malonyl, succinyl, and glutaryl &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyacyllysine posttranslational modifications and has recently emerged as a vulnerability in certain cancers. However, chemical probes to illuminate its potential as a pharmacological target have been lacking. Here we report the harnessing of aryl fluorosulfate&#8208;based electrophiles as an avenue to furnish covalent inhibitors that target SIRT5. Alkyne&#8208;tagged affinity&#8208;labeling agents recognize and capture overexpressed SIRT5 in cultured HEK293T cells and can label SIRT5 in the hearts of mice upon intravenous injection of the compound. This work demonstrates the utility of aryl fluorosulfate electrophiles for targeting of SIRT5 and suggests this as a means for the development of potential covalent drug candidates. It is our hope that these results will serve as inspiration for future studies investigating SIRT5 and general sirtuin biology in the mitochondria.

         <title>Hewettite ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O with Remarkably Stable Layers and Ultralarge Interlayer Spacing for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Via an ion exchange induced phase transformation, A2V6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K) was transformed to hewettite BV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O (B=Zn, Mg, Ca, Cu), accompanying with reconstructing the layers and expanding interlayer spacing. Benefiting from the remarkably stable layers and ultralarge interlayer spacing, the ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O cathode exhibits an ultralong life and ultrahigh rate capability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, substantially better than AVO.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their intrinsic safety, low&#8208;cost and high energy&#8208;intensity. Vanadium&#8208;based materials are widely used as the cathode of ZIBs, especially A2V6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K). However, AVO suffers from serious dissolution, phase transformation and narrow gallery spacing (&#8764;3&#8197;&#197;), leading to poor cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we unveiled the root cause of the performance degradation in the AVO cathode and therefore developed a new high&#8208;performance cathode of ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O (ZVO) for ZIB. Through a method of ion exchange induced phase transformation, AVO was converted to hewettite ZVO with larger gallery spacing (&#8764;6&#8197;&#197;) and more stable V6O16 layers. ZVO cathode thus constructed delivers a high capacity of 365 and 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 and 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1, while 86&#8201;% and 70&#8201;% of its capacity are retained at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles and at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10000&#8197;cycles, substantially better than conventional AVO.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic [4+2] Cycloaddition of Allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium/Malphos catalytic recipe has been developed for the dynamic kinetic intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. The desired cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products were obtained with decent yields and excellent stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Its dynamic kinetic nature has been confirmed by careful mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes afforded cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products with an excellent chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantio&#8208;selectivity. Many synthetically useful functional groups are tolerated. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated. Based on the careful experimental studies, a mechanism involving the rapid racemization of the allene moiety in the starting materials has been proposed.

         <title>Improved Charge Separation in Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) Imides with Semi&#8208;coherent Interfaces for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides with semi&#8208;coherent interface largely promotes the seperation and transfer of charge carriers owing to the build&#8208;in electric field and thereby enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency.







Abstract
The construction of heterojunctions is a promising manner to accelerate the separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface. Herein, a binary poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides (PHI/PTI) with semi&#8208;coherent interfaces was fabricated via a facile two&#8208;step salt&#8208;melt synthetic process. The built&#8208;in electric fields at the semi&#8208;coherent interface endow prompt exciton splitting and charge carrier separation. Hence, the optimized PHI/PTI&#8208;based copolymer presents a high apparent quantum yield (AQY=64&#8201;%) for visible&#8208;light driven hydrogen production, by the aids of K2HPO4 as charge transfer mediator. This study provides physical insights for the rational promotion of the photocatalytic performance from the viewpoint of interfacial engineering of photocatalytic junctions on crystalline carbon nitride based semiconductors.

         <title>A Germapyramidane Switches Between 3D Cluster and 2D Cyclic Structures in Single&#8208;Electron Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutual redox&#8208;isomerisation of a cationic nido&#8208;germapyramidane into a planar aromatic germole&#8208;diide is reported. The mechanism was elucidated using electrochemical and theoretical studies.







Abstract
Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;substituted iphosphate&#8208;diide, (Ipr)2C2P2 (IDP), with GeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dioxane and KBArF24 [(BarF24)&#8722;=tetrakis[(3,5&#8208;trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate)] afforded the dicationic spherical&#8208;aromatic nido&#8208;cluster [Ge(&#951;4&#8208;IDP)]2+ ([1]2+) (Ipr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). This complex is a rare heavy analogue of the elusive pyramidane [C(&#951;4&#8208;C4H4)]. [1]2+ undergoes two reversible one&#8208;electron reductions, which yield the radical cation [2]&#8901;+ and the neutral GeII species 3. Both [2]&#8901;+ and 3 rearrange in solution forming the 2D aromatic and planar imidazolium&#8208;substituted digermolide [4]2+ and germole&#8208;diide 5, respectively. Both planar species can be oxidized back to [1]2+ using AgSbF6. These redox&#8208;isomerizations correspond to the fundamental transformation of a 3D aromatic cluster into a 2D aromatic ring compound upon reduction and vice versa. The mechanism of these reactions was elucidated using DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry experiments.

         <title>Realizing All&#8208;Climate Li&#8208;S Batteries by Using a Porous Sub&#8208;Nano Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) was constructed as a bifunctional separator coating for Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the merits of the narrow band gap and fully conjugated porous structure, the modified batteries can operate under the all&#8208;climate temperature ranging from &#8722;40 to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries with high energy density are currently receiving enormous attention. However, their redox kinetics at low temperature is extremely tardy, and polysulfides shuttling is serious at high temperature, which severely hinders the implementation of wide&#8208;temperature Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we propose an all&#8208;climate Li&#8208;S battery based on an ether&#8208;based electrolyte by using a porous sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) modified separator. It's demonstrated that the fully conjugated SAF&#8208;3 with a small pore size (0.97&#8197;nm) and narrow band gap (1.72&#8197;eV) could efficiently block the polysulfides shuttling at elevated temperature and boost the polysulfides conversion at low temperature. Consequently, the SAF&#8208;3 modified cells work well in a wide temperature ranging from &#8722;40 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, when operated at room temperature, the modified cell exhibits 90&#8201;% capacity retention over 100 cycles under high&#8208;sulfur loading (5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

         <title>Strain Control to Stabilize Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;uniformly distributed tensile strain is likely to present in solution&#8208;processed perovskite thin films, which severely undermines the operational stability of resultant perovskite solar cells. A fundamental understanding and cautious control of residual strain within the perovskites is indispensable to derive stable perovskite materials with designed properties.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are rivaling most commercial photovoltaics in the aspect of efficiency and cost, while their intrinsic instability remains a major concern for their practical deployment. The presence of undesirable strain in PSCs during device fabrication and operation refers to the extension/narrowing of chemical bonds and expansion/shrinkage of lattice volume, which largely affects device stability due to promoted phase transition, chemical decomposition, and mechanical fragility. Pioneering investigations and remarkable achievements have revealed that strain control is indispensable in the design of stable PSCs. Herein, the evolution of strain in perovskite thin films and its effect on device performance is elucidated, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies of strain modulation are systematically reviewed. A thorough understanding and cautious control of the strain&#8208;related phenomenon pave the pathway to derive perovskite materials with desired properties.

Total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8722;)&#8208;janoxepin, two fungal cyclotripeptides featuring a complex heterocyclic core and interesting phytotoxic and antimalarial activities, have been achieved in a highly convergent manner. In the key step, a one&#8208;pot cascade initiated by fragment coupling (cyclocondensation) was followed by a spontaneous retro&#8208;Claisen rearrangement to afford a 2,5&#8208;dihydrooxepin&#8208;fused heterotricyclic product.

A key step in this synthesis is a one&#8208;pot cascade initiated by the cyclocondensation of two fragments&#8212;a hindered 2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;acyl fluoride and an electron&#8208;deficient cyclic amidine&#8212;to release a reactive spiro[2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1,5&#8242;&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;4&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dione]. This intermediate underwent a spontaneous retro&#8208;Claisen rearrangement that was rationalized by DFT calculations. The cascade directly afforded a 2,5&#8208;dihydrooxepin&#8208;fused heterotricyclic product, and the challenging oxepin ring was finally forged by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of an allylic fluoride intermediate.

The cascade directly afforded a 2,5-dihydrooxepin-fused heterotricyclic product, and the challenging oxepin ring was finally forged by the palladium-catalyzed &#946;-hydride elimination of an allylic fluoride intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli Responsive Silylene: Electromerism Induced Reversible Switching Between Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed valent silicon compound is synthesized in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The mixed valency of the compound allowed reversible electromerism under the influence of Lewis&#8208;acid/base acting as external stimuli. A mono&#8208;silylene ligand could be transformed to bis&#8208;silylene by adding CuI salts. Upon removal of CuI salts, the bis&#8208;silylene motif reverts back to mono&#8208;silylene.







Abstract
Electromerism is a very well&#8208;known phenomenon in transition metal chemistry. In main group chemistry, this concept has only started getting attention recently. We report stimuli responsive low&#8208;valent silicon compounds exhibiting electromerism. A mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8208;silylene 1, [LSi&#8722;Si(NDipp)L] (L=PhC(NtBu)2), was synthesized in a single step from amidinate&#8208;chlorosilylene. Compound 1 has two interconnected Si atoms in formally +I and +III oxidation states. Upon treatment with Lewis acidic CuIX (X=mesityl, Cl, Br, I), electron redistribution occurs resulting in the formation of [{LSi(NDipp)Si(L)}&#8722;CuX], in which both silicon atoms are in the +II formal oxidation state. Removal of the copper center from [{LSi(NDipp)Si(L)}&#8722;CuX] by using a Lewis basic carbene led to reformation of the precursor [LSi&#8722;Si(NDipp)L]. Thus, the process is fully reversible. This showcases the first example of Lewis acid/base&#8208;induced reversible electromerism in silicon chemistry.

         <title>Maximized Green Photoluminescence in Tb&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Pressure&#8208;Treated Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pressure&#8208;treated Tb(BTC)(H2O)6 exhibits unprecedentedly enhanced PLQY of 90.4&#8201;% comparing to the initial state (50.6&#8201;%). This pressure&#8208;treated process can optimize the ligand singlet and triplet states close to the Tb3+ energy level, which boosts ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer in Tb(BTC)(H2O)6.







Abstract
Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks are of great interest in the development of photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their structural tunability and intrinsic features of lanthanide elements. However, there exists some limitations arising from poor matching with metal ions, thereby exhibiting a weak ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer (LMET) process. Here we demonstrate a pressure&#8208;treated strategy for achieving high PL performance in green&#8208;emitting Tb(BTC)(H2O)6. The PL quantum yield of pressure&#8208;treated sample increased from 50.6&#8201;% to 90.4&#8201;%. We found that the enhanced hydrogen bonds locked the conjugated configuration formed by two planes of carboxyl group and benzene ring, enabling the promoted intersystem crossing to effectively drive LMET. Moreover, the optimized singlet and triplet states also validated the facilitated LMET process. This work opens the opportunity of structure optimization to improve PL performance in MOFs by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.

         <title>A Highly Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network without Creep: Mission Impossible?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the largest challenges in the design of dynamic covalent networks is to balance reactivity during reprocessing with stability during use. In this Minireview several strategies are highlighted that combine high processability and creep resistance such as latent catalysis, availability of reactive groups, substituents and intrinsic stability of the dynamic bond.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks provide an interesting solution to the challenging recyclability of thermosets and elastomers. One of the remaining design constraints, however, is balancing thermal reprocessability in the form of material flow with dimensional stability during use. As a result, many chemistries are being investigated in order to improve bond reactivity control and material robustness. This Minireview highlights a number of promising concepts, with a particular emphasis on disconnecting chemical reactivity in low and high temperature regimes to obtain creep resistant, yet highly dynamic polymer networks. In addition, we will highlight the impact of sharp reactivity changes when applying extrapolation&#8208;based approaches during rheological analysis. As a result, we are confident that abandoning the myth of &#8220;permanent&#8221; reactivity will aid in the development of sustainable polymeric materials that can truly combine the benefits of thermoplastic and thermoset behaviour.

Crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed to design MOF&#8208;based electrodes with higher capacity and faster electrochemical kinetics. The dominated exposing facets of PFC&#8208;8 can be regulated by a thermally&#8208;modified strategy, which delivers stronger OH&#8722; adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn growing attention as promising electrode candidates for rechargeable batteries. However, most studies focus on the direct use of MOF electrodes without any modification. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, a judicious tool to modify targeted properties of MOFs, has been long&#8208;neglected in the field of batteries. Herein, crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed to design MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high capacity and fast electrochemical kinetics. We found that a thermally&#8208;modified strategy can regulate the dominant exposed facet of Ni&#8208;based MOF (PFC&#8208;8). With the optimally exposed facets, the battery exhibited admirable rate capability (139.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 110.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that stronger OH&#8722; adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures induced by the regulated exposed facets boost the electrochemical performance.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite decades of studies, advances in the design of catalysts at the laboratory scale and insights into the underlying ECO2R processes have not yet led to high deployment rates in industry. This Review discusses practical challenges in the industrial chain that hamper the scaling&#8208;up deployment of ECO2R technology. In addition, insights are provided to accelerate the development of ECO2R technology.







Abstract
The global temperature increase must be limited to below 1.5&#8201;&#176;C to alleviate the worst effects of climate change. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECO2R) to generate chemicals and feedstocks is considered one of the most promising technologies to cut CO2 emission at an industrial level. However, despite decades of studies, advances at the laboratory scale have not yet led to high industrial deployment rates. This Review discusses practical challenges in the industrial chain that hamper the scaling&#8208;up deployment of the ECO2R technology. Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of about 100&#8201;% and current densities above 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 have been achieved for the ECO2R to CO/HCOOH, and the stability of the electrolysis system has been prolonged to 2000&#8197;h. For ECO2R to C2H4, the maximum FE is over 80&#8201;%, and the highest current density has reached the A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 level. Thus, it is believed that ECO2R may have reached the stage for scale&#8208;up. We aim to provide insights that can accelerate the development of the ECO2R technology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global temperature increase must be limited to below 1.5&#8201;&#176;C to alleviate the worst effects of climate change. Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) to generate chemicals and feedstocks is considered one of the most promising technologies to cut CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission at an industrial level. However, despite decades of studies, advances at the laboratory scale have not yet led to high industrial deployment rates. This Review discusses practical challenges in the industrial chain that hamper the scaling-up deployment of the ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R technology. Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of about 100&#8201;% and current densities above 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; have been achieved for the ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R to CO/HCOOH, and the stability of the electrolysis system has been prolonged to 2000&#8197;h. For ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the maximum FE is over 80&#8201;%, and the highest current density has reached the A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; level. Thus, it is believed that ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R may have reached the stage for scale-up. We aim to provide insights that can accelerate the development of the ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Reductive Amination in Nonenzymatic Amino Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why does biochemical amino acid synthesis proceed the way it does? Kinetic and mechanistic experiments with a model hydride donor were used to determine the intrinsic electrophilic reactivities of keto acids in reduction and reductive amination reactions. Comparing the nonenzymatic reactivity trends with those found in biology provides new insight into the structure of amino acid metabolism.







Abstract
Amino acid biosynthesis initiates with the reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate with ammonia to produce glutamate. However, the other &#945;&#8208;keto acids derived from the glyoxylate and Krebs cycles are converted into amino acids by transamination, rather than by reductive amination. Why is only one amino acid synthesized by reductive amination and not the others? To explore this question, we quantified the inherent reactivities of keto acids in nonenzymatic reduction and reductive amination by using BH3CN&#8722; as a model nucleophile. Biological &#945;&#8208;keto acids were found to show pronounced nonenzymatic reactivity differences for the formation of amino acids (&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&lt;oxaloacetate&#8776;pyruvate&#8810;glyoxylate). Accordingly, the flow of ammonia passes through the least reactive &#945;&#8208;keto acid of the Krebs cycle. One possible explanation for this choice is the position of the corresponding amino acid, glutamate, at the top of the thermodynamic landscape for subsequent transamination reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Alternating Polyisocyanate Copolymers by Anionic Polymerization for Mimicking Amphiphilic Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amphiphilic conformation of  &#945;&#8208;helical peptides has important biological functions, such as ion transport, antifreeze, and innate immunity, which can be mimicked by alternating polyisocyanate copolymers. We synthesized poly(allyl isocyanate&#8208;alt&#8208;(S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl isocyanate (P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)) and ammonium&#8208;containing P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) (N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)), ensuring the amphiphilic helical conformation. The benzyl group of SMBIC plays an important role in alternating copolymerization with its steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, while AIC provides an alkene group capable of introducing a customized functional group. The P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) with predominantly alternating sequence was acquired at  f  SMBIC/f  AIC  = 8 with a controlled molecular weight and narrow dispersity. N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)s were synthesized from thiol&#8208;ene radical addition with P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC).</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Inhibits Tumor Growth by Leveraging Cellular Proteasomal Degradation System to Degrade c&#8208;Met in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current action mechanisms for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics depend on occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology to mediate protein functions. We report a new mechanism where aptamers leverage cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade proteins for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer (hereinafter referred to as c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap) binds to the extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) and selectively induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma, causing c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Furthermore, c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap can induce a decrease in the heterodimeric partner proteins of c&#8208;Met and the downstream effector proteins in the c&#8208;Met signal axis, effectively inhibiting tumor growth in A549 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice. Our study uncovers a novel, actionable mechanism for aptamer therapeutics and opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal Dihedral Angle in Twisted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Organic Emitters for Maximized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) organic formwork with a large dihedral angle (&#952;DA) is usually adopted to narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap for obtaining excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, the dependence of overall TADF properties on &#952;DA has not been systematically investigated to this day. Taking new designed CzBP, CzBP&#8208;1M and CzBP&#8208;2M via introducing methyl as investigated models, it is found that (i) with increasing &#952;DA, the charge transfer component in S1 is larger than that in T1 in varying degrees, leading to non&#8208;monotonic spin&#8208;orbit couplings; (ii) the electron&#8208;vibration couplings between S1 and T1 states become the largest when &#952;DA approaching 80o, facilitating phonon&#8208;driven up&#8208;conversion; (iii) the overall TADF rate reaches a peak at &#952;DA near 80o. By this, the TADF on/off switching is realized via methyl moiety for regulating &#952;DA from theoretical prediction to experimental confirmation. Importantly, the &#952;DA near 80o would be a good descriptor for screening excellent D&#8208;A type TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonochemically&#8208;Induced Reduction of Alkenes to Alkanes with Ammonnia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the progressive defossilization of our industry, hydrogen has been identified as a central molecule to store renewable electricity. In this context, ammonia is now rapidly emerging as a promising hydrogen carrier for the future. This game change indirectly impacts the field of fine chemistry where hydrogenation reactions are widely deployed. In particular, the possibility to perform hydrogenation reactions using NH  3  directly instead of H  2  has become highly desirable but it remains a very difficult scientific task, which we address in this communication. Here we show that the N&#8208;H bond of NH  3  can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the  in situ  formation of a diimide, which subsequently induces the hydrogenation of alkenes. Advantageously, this work does not involve any transition metal and releases N  2  as a sole co&#8208;product.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Quench Reactions of Enantioenriched Secondary Alkyllithium Reagents in Batch and Continuous Flow Using an I/Li&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a practical in situ quench (ISQ) procedure involving the generation of chiral secondary alkyllithiums from secondary alkyl iodides (including functionalized iodides bearing an ester or a nitrile) in the presence of various electrophiles such as aldehydes, ketones, Weinreb amides, isocyanates, sulfides, or boronates. This ISQ&#8208;reaction allowed the preparation of a broad range of optically enriched ketones, alcohols, amides, sulfides and boronic acid esters in typically 90&#8208;98% ee. Remarkably, these reactions were performed at &#8722;78 &#176;C or &#8722;40 &#176;C in batch. A continuous flow set&#8208;up permitted reaction temperatures between &#8722;20 &#176;C and 0 &#176;C and allowed a scale&#8208;up up to a 40&#8208;fold without further optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Storage Chemistry of Organic Cathodes for High&#8208;Energy and High&#8208;Power Density Divalent Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent batteries show promising prospects for next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we report a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode capable of highly reversible storage of tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anions in both Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) battery systems. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal the redox reaction mechanism of the PTPAn cathode material. The Mg and Ca cells exhibit a cell voltage &gt;3 V, a high&#8208;power density of ~3000 W kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;energy density of ~300 Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, the combination of the PTPAn cathode with a calcium&#8208;tin (Ca&#8208;Sn) alloy anode could enable a long battery&#8208;life of 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of 60%. The anion storage chemistry associated with dual&#8208;ion electrochemical concept demonstrates a new feasible pathway towards high&#8208;performance divalent ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligothiophene Ring Strapped Perylene Bisimides: A Functionalizable Co&#8208;axial Donor&#8208;Acceptor Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aesthetic designs from nature enable to gain new knowledge and, at the same time, inspire to materialize the unattempted scientific models. In this context, multicomponent macrocycles embody the advantage of precisely positioning the structural units to achieve efficient communication between them. However, a functionalizable macrocycle to achieve ultrafast charge separation and stabilization has not been attempted. Here, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and transient absorption of a new functionalizable macrocycle consisting of oligothiophene ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide. Transient absorption results point to a sequential improvement in charge separation and stabilization from the macrocycle to the corresponding linear dimer and 2D&#8208;polymer due to the unique design. Our macrocycle design with a supportive spatial arrangement of the donor and acceptor units will urge more complex synthetic systems with exciting electron transfer and charge separation features.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Assembly of Complex Oxindoles by Enantioselective Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral oxindoles are important chemical scaffolds found in many natural products, thus attracting considerable attention to their enantioselective synthesis. Highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthetic methods for constructing C3 quaternary oxindoles have been well&#8208;developed. However, the efficient synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted tertiary oxindoles has been rarely reported due to the ease of racemization of the tertiary stereocenter via enolization. Therefore, this research reports on multicomponent assembly (including N&#8208;aryl diazoamides, aldehydes, and enamines/indoles) of complex oxindoles using enantioselective cooperative catalysis. These reactions proceed under mild conditions and show broad substrate scope, affording the desired coupling products (&gt; 90 examples) with good to excellent stereocontrol. Additionally, this research also demonstrates the synthetic potential of this annulation by constructing the 6,6,5&#8208;tricyclic lactone core structure of Speradine A.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) represents arguably one of the most straightforward access to the significant chiral tertiary carbon centers, however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the first example of catalytic coordination&#8208;induced asymmetric HAT reaction has been developed relying on a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;controlled enantioselective HAT process. The reaction transforms easily accessible glycidic esters, thioesters and amides to synthetically valuable formal formaldehyde aldol adducts in an enantioconvergent manner, along with broad scope and highly regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Copper&#8208;Zinc Alloy Layer Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode of Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent Cu&#8722;Zn alloy interlayer possessing high binding energy with Zn atoms and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn anode (Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn). The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the side reactions such as pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Constructing stable surface modification layer is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zinc (Zn) metal anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. Herein, a multicomponent Cu&#8722;Zn alloy interlayer with superior Zn affinity, high toughness and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn foil (Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn) to fabricate ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode. Owning to the advantages of high binding energy of Cu&#8722;Zn alloy layer with Zn atoms and less contact area between metallic Zn and electrolyte, the as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances. Accordingly, the symmetric battery with Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 5496&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn//V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 600 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Constructing stable surface modification layer is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zinc (Zn) metal anode in aqueous Zn-ion battery. Herein, a multicomponent Cu&#8722;Zn alloy interlayer with superior Zn affinity, high toughness and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn foil (Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn) to fabricate ultra-stable Zn metal anode. Owning to the advantages of high binding energy of Cu&#8722;Zn alloy layer with Zn atoms and less contact area between metallic Zn and electrolyte, the as-prepared Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances. Accordingly, the symmetric battery with Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn electrode exhibits an ultra-long cycle life of 5496&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the Cu&#8722;Zn@Zn//V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 600 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cleavage of C&#8722;P Bond: Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomers Containing a P&#8208;Stereogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of a C&#8722;P bond for the construction of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center. The products are isolated in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 98&#8201;% ee). One of the isolated products is shown to catalyze the [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, thus demonstrating the utility of the present methodology.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;P bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful tool for the formation of both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;P bond. However, the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond is still undeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8722;P bond for the construction of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines and stereogenic axis. This protocol enables the quick synthesis of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center in high yields, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;% ee, &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. The product is able to serve as chiral catalyst in phosphine catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, showing the great potential of the present methodology.

         <title>Cationic Additive with a Rigid Solvation Shell for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In aqueous zinc ion batteries, Sc3+ with low water exchange rate constant (kex) has a dynamically rigid solvation shell, holding onto its spatial occupation and thus preventing zinc ions from concentrating near tips on the zinc metal surface towards indiscriminate dendrite growth. The rigidity of solvation shells of redox&#8208;inactive cations is proposed as a descriptor in determining the tip&#8208;blocking effect.







Abstract
Despite substantial progresses, in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), developing zinc metal anodes with long&#8208;term reliable cycling capabilities is nontrivial because of dendritic growth and related parasitic reactions on the zinc surface. Here, we exploit the tip&#8208;blocking effect of a scandium (Sc3+) additive in the electrolyte to induce uniform zinc deposition. Additional to the tri&#8208;valency of Sc3+, the rigidity of its hydration shell effectively prevents zinc ions from concentrating at the surface tips, enabling highly stable cycling under challenging conditions. The shell rigidity, quantified by the rate constant of the exchange reaction (kex), is established as a key descriptor for evaluating the tip&#8208;blocking effect of redox&#8208;inactive cations, explaining inconsistent results when only the valence state is considered. Moreover, the tip&#8208;blocking effect of Sc3+ is maintained in blends with organic solvents, allowing the zinc anode to cycle reliably even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C without corrosion.

         <title>Mesoporous N&#8208;rich Carbon with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms as a Multifunctional Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon with single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(p)) is synthesized by a novel and facile strategy and employed as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The unique architecture, N dopant, and single&#8208;Ni atoms enable the effective confinement and fast redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides towards efficient Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Physicochemical confinement and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are crucial to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, a NH4Cl&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is developed to fabricate highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon (designed as NC(p)) featuring thin outer shells and porous inner networks, on which single&#8208;Ni atoms are anchored to form an excellent sulfur host (designed as Ni&#8208;NC(p)) for Li&#8208;S batteries. During pyrolysis, the pyrolytic HCl from confined NH4Cl within ZIF&#8208;8 will in situ etch ZIF&#8208;8 to produce rich mesoporous in the carbonized product NC(p). The mesoporous Ni&#8208;NC(p) enables favorable electron/ion transfer, high sulfur loading, and effective confinement of LiPSs, while the catalytic effect of single&#8208;Ni species enhances the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the Ni&#8208;NC(p) host delivers obviously improved Li&#8208;S battery performance with high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling stability.

         <title>A Highly Twisted Carbazole&#8208;Fused DABNA Derivative as an Orange&#8208;Red TADF Emitter for OLEDs with Nearly 40&#8201;% EQE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is reported by fusing carbazoles to a MR framework DABNA to significantly redshifted emission while maintaining the MR&#8208;dominated features. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA can deliver a high PLQY of 99&#8201;%. Its OLEDs reached a record&#8208;high EQE of 39.2&#8201;% in OLEDs and remain EQEs over 30&#8201;% over a wide concentration range of 1&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is currently a research hotspot in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high color purity and high exciton utilization. However, there are only a handful of MR&#8208;TADF emitters with emissions beyond the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. The very limited emission colors for MR&#8208;TADF emitters are mainly caused by the fact that so far molecular modifications of MR&#8208;TADF do not offer much change in the emission colors. Here, we report a new approach to modifying a prototypical MR core of DABNA by fusing carbazoles to the MR framework. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule (TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA) basically maintains the MR&#8208;dominated features of DABNA while red&#8208;shifting the emission. Its OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 39.2&#8201;% with a peak at 588&#8197;nm, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for OLEDs with peaks beyond 560&#8197;nm. This work provides a new approach for significantly tunning emission colors of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)/Imidazolidine Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylations were realized with novel C2&#8208;symmetric chiral imidazolidine carboxylic acids, with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The C&#8722;H alkylation took place with simultaneous construction of central and axial chirality, reaching branched/linear ratios of &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er.







Abstract
Enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has surfaced as a transformative toolbox for the efficient assembly of chiral molecules. However, despite of major advances in rhodium and palladium catalysis, ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has thus far largely proven elusive. In contrast, we herein report on a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation. The key to success was represented by the identification of novel C2&#8208;symmetric chiral imidazolidine carboxylic acids (CICAs), which are easily accessible in a one&#8208;pot fashion, as highly effective chiral ligands. This ruthenium/CICA system enabled the efficient installation of central and axial chirality, and featured excellent branched to linear ratios with generally &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr and up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er. Mechanistic studies by experiment and computation were carried out to understand the catalyst mode of action.

&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II)-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylations were realized with novel C2-symmetric chiral imidazolidine carboxylic acids, with high chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. The C&#8722;H alkylation took place with simultaneous construction of central and axial chirality, reaching branched/linear ratios of &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er.

         <title>Double&#8208;pronged Antimicrobial Agents based on a Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Type Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type photosensitizer featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE&#8208;PS) for curing infections caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria. This AIE&#8208;PS achieved a high photodynamic killing efficacy towards both extracellular and intracellular pathogens in vitro and in vivo by inducing ROS accumulation, disrupting the bacterial membrane integrity and potentiating the lysosomal bioactivities of macrophages.







Abstract
Novel antibacterial agents are urgently needed to control the infections induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. Herein, we rationally designed and facilely synthesized a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type luminogen with strong red/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission, great aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, and excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The newly developed molecule TTTh killed the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by triggering the ROS accumulation in bacteria and interrupting the membrane integrity. Moreover, TTTh specifically targeted the lysosomes and potentiated their maturation to accelerate the clearance of intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reduced bacterial burden and improved healing were observed in TTTh&#8208;treated wounds with negligible side effects. Our study expands the biological design and application of AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and provides new insights into discovering novel antibacterial targets and agents.

         <title>Linear Axially Chiral Conjugated Polymers Exhibiting Ultralong Low&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of linear axially chiral conjugated polymers were constructed in a facile manner. These polymers showed an ultralong low&#8208;temperature afterglow of up to 33&#8197;s and also exhibited intense circularly polarized luminescence with an absolute glum value of up to 0.01.







Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), as two important branches in the field of organic optical functional materials have broad prospects. In this work, a pair of novel conjugated polymers with low&#8208;temperature UOP and intense CPL properties are constructed by incorporating rigid axially chiral chromophores into a polymeric backbone. The twisted and rigid biphenyl skeleton not only effectively reduces the energy gap between the S1 and T to greatly facilitate the intersystem crossing process, but also suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay from T1 to S0. As a result, a strong and ultralong afterglow of up to 33&#8197;s is achieved in 2&#8208;MeTHF at 77&#8197;K. Moreover, the repeating rigid biphenyl skeleton with its helix&#8208;like form also promotes the chiroptical activity of the polymers, and intense signals are shown in the low&#8208;temperature CPL spectra with absolute glum values of 9.7&#215;10&#8722;3 and 5.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission peaks, respectively. This work represents the first low&#8208;temperature materials with UOP and CPL properties, which provides a new guideline and perspective for the development of persistent luminescence materials.

         <title>Meerwein&#8208;type Bromoarylation with Arylthianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite more than 80&#8197;years of research, Meerwein haloarylation with complex small molecules has not been possible because the required aryldiazonium salts are often not readily accessible from complex structures. We report the first late stage Meerwein&#8208;type bromoarylation of alkenes with stable arylthianthrenium salts, which provide the opportunity to generate complexity quickly.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalyzed Meerwein&#8208;type bromoarylation of alkenes with stable arylthianthrenium salts, formed by site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thianthrenation. This protocol can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of a variety of biomolecules that are difficult to access by other aryl coupling reagents. Halogen introduction allows for a variety of follow&#8208;up transformations, affording numerous biologically active skeletons.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework@Metal Oxide Heterostructures Induced by Electron&#8208;Beam Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF synthesis is achieved by high&#8208;energy electron&#8208;beam irradiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. For ZIF&#8208;8, this synthesis can be accomplished within minutes under ambient conditions, with an energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal route. By changing the dose of the electron beam a hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8@ZnO heterostructure can be formed.







Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a distinct family of crystalline porous materials finding extensive applications. Their synthesis often requires elevated temperature and relatively long reaction time. We report here the first case of MOF synthesis activated by high&#8208;energy (1.5&#8197;MeV) electron beam radiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. Using ZIF&#8208;8 as a representative for demonstration, this type of synthesis can be accomplished under ambient conditions within minutes, leading to energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal condition. Interestingly, by controlling the absorbed dose in the synthesis, the electron beam not only activates the formation reaction of ZIF&#8208;8, but also partially etches the material during the synthesis affording a hierarchical pore architecture and highly crystalline ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8. This gives rise to a new strategy to obtain MOF@metal oxide heterostructures, finding utilities in photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Cluster Nanospheres in Water&#8208;Deficient Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous calcium carbonate(ACC) nanoparticles are synthesized in water&#8208;deficient ethanol solution. The nanoparticles consist of tiny clusters as revealed by cryo&#8208;TEM. ACC can aggregate on templates such as graphene oxide nanosheets. These findings provide a theoretical basis for controlled synthesis of ACC and a strategy to fabricate ultrathin mineral coatings on different substrates.







Abstract
As the key intermediate phase of crystalline calcium carbonate biominerals, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) remains mysterious in its structures because of its long&#8208;range disorder and instability. We herein report the synthesis of ACC nanospheres in a water&#8208;deficient organic solvent system. The obtained ACC nanospheres are very stable under dry conditions. Cryo&#8208;TEM reveals that each nanospheres consists of smaller nanosized clusters. We further demonstrate that these clusters can precipitate on other substrates to form an ultrathin ACC coating, which should be an ACC cluster monolayer. The results demonstrate that the presence of small ACC clusters as the subunits of larger aggregates is inherent to ACC synthesized in water&#8208;alcohol system but not induced by polymer additives.

&lt;p&gt;As the key intermediate phase of crystalline calcium carbonate biominerals, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) remains mysterious in its structures because of its long-range disorder and instability. We herein report the synthesis of ACC nanospheres in a water-deficient organic solvent system. The obtained ACC nanospheres are very stable under dry conditions. Cryo-TEM reveals that each nanospheres consists of smaller nanosized clusters. We further demonstrate that these clusters can precipitate on other substrates to form an ultrathin ACC coating, which should be an ACC cluster monolayer. The results demonstrate that the presence of small ACC clusters as the subunits of larger aggregates is inherent to ACC synthesized in water-alcohol system but not induced by polymer additives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approach to Chemically Durable Nickel and Cobalt Lanthanum&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Based Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the rare&#8208;earth nitride complexes enable highly efficient ammonia synthesis, they suffer from chemical sensitivity to air and moisture. Using Al&#8208;doped LaN as the model material, we show the impact of La&#8722;Al metallic bond formation on improving the catalysts&#8217; durability under air and moisture without affecting original functionalities.







Abstract
Metal nitride complexes have recently been proposed as an efficient noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst for ammonia synthesis utilizing a dual active site concept. However, their high sensitivity to air and moisture has restricted potential applications. We report that their chemical sensitivity can be improved by introducing Al into the LaN lattice, thereby forming La&#8722;Al metallic bonds (La&#8722;Al&#8722;N). The catalytic activity and mechanism of the resulting TM/La&#8722;Al&#8722;N (TM=Ni, Co) are comparable to the previously reported TM/LaN catalyst. Notably, the catalytic activity did not degrade after exposure to air and moisture. Kinetic analysis and isotopic experiment showed that La&#8722;Al&#8722;N is responsible for N2 absorption and activation despite substantial Al being introduced into its lattice because the local coordination of the lattice N remained largely unchanged. These findings show the effectiveness of metallic bond formation, which can support the chemical stability of rare&#8208;earth nitrides with retention of catalytic functionality.

         <title>Anchoring LiCl in the Nanopores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Ultra&#8208;High Uptake and Selective Separation of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents are developed by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of the metal&#8211;organic framework MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2, which show a record high capture capacity of 33.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 NH3 at 1.0&#8197;bar and 25&#8201;&#176;C as well as excellent selective separation performance of NH3 from NH3/N2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, NH3/CO2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and NH3/H2O at 50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is an important chemical raw material and a unique carbon&#8208;free fuel with high hydrogen energy density. Thus, NH3 capture, storage, and desorption are of significant importance. However, high capacity capture, low energy desorption, and selective separation of NH3 are still challengs so far. Here, we report high&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). It is found that the optimal composite shows a capture capacity of 33.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 NH3 at 1.0&#8197;bar and 25&#8201;&#176;C, which far exceeds the current record among the reported porous materials. Notably, the excellent capture capacity at low pressure and high temperature makes it possible to selectively capture NH3 from NH3/N2, NH3/CO2, and NH3/H2O. It is revealed that synergistic action of NH3 coordination to the highly dispersed Li+ in the MOF nanopores and hydrogen bonding of NH3 with Cl&#8722; account for such an excellent capture and selectivity performance.

         <title>Challenges Arising from Continuous&#8208;Flow Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview aims to provide a survey of the symbiotic developments of flow chemistry and olefin metathesis. Looking at the current state of the art, key challenges have been retrospectively identified in terms of both catalyst and flow reactor design and development, which together paint an intriguing outlook for the future development at this interface.







Abstract
The versatility of olefin metathesis is evident from its successful applications ranging from natural product synthesis to the valorization of renewable feedstocks. On the other side, flow chemistry has recently gained particular interest among the synthetic community, offering valuable alternatives to classic batch chemistry and paving the way to the development of new transformations. The application of continuous&#8208;flow methods to olefin metathesis represents one of the most promising evolutions in the field at the interface of industrially relevant synthesis and reactor engineering, significantly improving some of the typical problems such as undesired self&#8208;reactions and ethylene&#8208;mediated catalyst deactivation. This Minireview aims to provide a brief survey covering the major aspects of those techniques which we hope may be of interest for the chemical community as well as those interested in catalysis, continuous processing, enabling technologies and reactor design.

         <title>Reversible Copper Cathode for Nonaqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports copper metal can work as a cathode of dual&#8208;ion batteries in non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. The reversible conversion between commercial bulk copper metal and copper salt Cu(TFSI)2 demonstrates high capacity, relatively high voltage, and relatively stable cycle life in lithium dual&#8208;ion batteries. This finding may offer a promising direction for enhancing the energy density of dual&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Most reported cathodes of nonaqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) host anions via insertion reactions. It is necessary to explore new cathode chemistry to increase the battery energy density. To date, transition metals have yet to be investigated for nonaqueous DIBs, albeit they may offer high capacity in anodic conversion reactions. Here, we report that bulk copper powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of 762&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.2&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li and relatively stable cycling in common organic electrolytes. The operation of the copper electrode is coupled with the transfer of anion charge carriers. An anion exchange membrane separator is employed to prevent Cu2+ from crossing from the catholyte to the anode side. We designed an unbalanced electrolyte with a more concentrated anolyte than a catholyte. This addresses the concentration overpotential ensued during charge and facilitates the high specific capacity and enhanced reversibility. This finding provides a promising direction for high&#8208;energy DIBs.

         <title>Fluorinated Rocksalt Cathode with Ultra&#8208;high Active Li Content for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;capacity cathodes are restricted by the conflicts between the capacity and the structural instability. We report a new type of ultra&#8208;high Li compounds: Li4+xMoO5Fx (1&#8804;x&#8804;3) with the reversible shuttling of 3.8&#8197;Li+ ions per formula, showing the probability of stable the highly delithiated structure through the &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of fluorination. This discovery opens up new opportunities to extend the cathode materials into the ultra&#8208;high Li domain.







Abstract
The key to increasing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries is to incorporate high contents of extractable Li into the cathode. Unfortunately, this triggers formidable challenges including structural instability and irreversible chemistry under operation. Here, we report a new kind of ultra&#8208;high Li compound: Li4+xMoO5Fx (1&#8804;x&#8804;3) for cathode with an unprecedented level of electrochemically active Li (&gt;3&#8197;Li+ per formula), delivering a reversible capacity up to 438&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Unlike other reported Li&#8208;rich cathodes, Li4+xMoO5Fx presents distinguished structure stability to immunize against irreversible behaviors. Through spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, we find an anionic redox&#8208;dominated charge compensation with negligible oxygen release and voltage decay. Our theoretical analysis reveals a &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of high&#8208;level fluorination stabilizes the anionic redox by reducing the oxygen ions in pure&#8208;Li conditions, enabling a facile, reversible, and high Li&#8208;portion cycling.

     alt="Fluorinated Rocksalt Cathode with Ultra-high Active Li Content for Lithium-ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-capacity cathodes are restricted by the conflicts between the capacity and the structural instability. We report a new type of ultra-high Li compounds: Li&lt;sub&gt;4+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (1&#8804;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;3) with the reversible shuttling of 3.8&#8197;Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions per formula, showing the probability of stable the highly delithiated structure through the &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of fluorination. This discovery opens up new opportunities to extend the cathode materials into the ultra-high Li domain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to increasing the energy density of lithium-ion batteries is to incorporate high contents of extractable Li into the cathode. Unfortunately, this triggers formidable challenges including structural instability and irreversible chemistry under operation. Here, we report a new kind of ultra-high Li compound: Li&lt;sub&gt;4+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (1&#8804;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;3) for cathode with an unprecedented level of electrochemically active Li (&amp;gt;3&#8197;Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per formula), delivering a reversible capacity up to 438&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Unlike other reported Li-rich cathodes, Li&lt;sub&gt;4+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; presents distinguished structure stability to immunize against irreversible behaviors. Through spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, we find an anionic redox-dominated charge compensation with negligible oxygen release and voltage decay. Our theoretical analysis reveals a &#8220;reductive effect&#8221; of high-level fluorination stabilizes the anionic redox by reducing the oxygen ions in pure-Li conditions, enabling a facile, reversible, and high Li-portion cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A LRET Nanoplatform Consisting of Lanthanide and Amorphous Manganese Oxide for NIR&#8208;II Luminescence Lifetime Imaging of Tumor Redox Status</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime regulation strategy was developed based on the energy transfer from lanthanide to amorphous manganese oxide. The redox status of cells and tumors was quantitatively visualized through NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging.







Abstract
Designing luminescence lifetime sensors in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window is a great challenge due to the difficult structural construction. Here, we report a tumor redox responsive and easily synthesized material, amorphous manganese oxide (MnOx) with indirect band gap of 1.02&#8197;eV, as an energy acceptor to build a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) toolbox for universally regulating NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide nanoparticles, in which energy transfer is based on matched energy gap instead of conventional overlapped spectra. We further utilize ytterbium (Yb3+)&#8208;doped YbNP@MnOx as an NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime sensor to realize in vitro quantitative redox visualization with relative errors under 5&#8201;% in samples covered with mouse skin. Furthermore, HepG2 cells and tumors with high redox state have been accurately distinguished by NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging. The quantified intracellular and intratumor glutathione (GSH) levels are highly consistent with the commercial kit results, illustrating the reliable redox visualization ability in biological tissue.

         <title>Design of Co&#8208;Cu Diatomic Site Catalysts for High&#8208;efficiency Synergistic CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomic site catalysts consisting of Co&#8208;Cu hetero&#8208;diatomic pairs is designed via a general and facile method. Industrial&#8208;level current density can be easily achieved in a flow cell system with the maximum CO partial current density up to 483&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CO selectivity can maintain above 95&#8201;% over a wide current density range from 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely studied in the field of CO2 electroreduction, but industrial&#8208;level current density and near&#8208;unity product selectivity are still difficult to achieve. Herein, a diatomic site catalysts (DASCs) consisting of Co&#8208;Cu hetero&#8208;diatomic pairs is synthesized. The CoCu DASC exhibits excellent selectivity with the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;%. The CO selectivity can maintain above 95&#8201;% over a wide current density range from 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The maximum CO partial current density can reach to 483&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell, far exceed industrial&#8208;level current density requirements (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Theoretical calculation reveals that the synergistic catalysis of the Co&#8208;Cu bimetallic sites reduce the activation energy and promote the formation of intermediate *COOH. This work shows that the introduction of another metal atom into SACs can significantly affect the electronic structure and then enhance the catalytic activity of SACs.

         <title>Cu Single Atom Nanozyme Based High&#8208;Efficiency Mild Photothermal Therapy through Cellular Metabolic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) drastically compromises the treatment effect of mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, we designed a polyporous Cu single atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) loaded with licogliflozin (LIK066) for HSP&#8208;silencing induced mild PTT. On one hand, LIK066 inhibits glucose uptake by shutting sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) &#8220;valve&#8221;, effectively blocking the energy source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Without sufficient energy, cancer cells cannot synthesize HSPs. In this work, Cu SAzyme presents extraordinary multienzyme activities to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm formation, which can damage the existing HSPs in cancer cells. Through a two&#8208;pronged strategy of SGLT inhibitor and ROS storm, LIK066&#8208;loaded Cu SAzyme shows high efficiency for comprehensive removal of HSPs to realize mild PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Formation and Potent Antioxidant Activity of Macrocyclic Dimers Containing Disulfide and Selenide Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During attempts to prepare dithiaspiroselenuranes as GPx mimetics, a series of unexpected dimeric macrocycles was obtained, each containing two selenide and two disulfide moieties in rings ranging from 18&#8208; to 26&#8208;membered. The products showed potent GPx&#8208;like activity in an NMR assay based on their ability to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with benzyl thiol. The high catalytic activity was attributed to transannular effects during selenide to selenoxide oxidation. This redox process was also characterized by an induction period that indicated autocatalysis in the formation of an intermediate selenoxide from the oxidation of the corresponding selenide.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Aerobic Nitrogen Photooxidation on Titania through In Situ Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate is an important raw material for chemical fertilizers, but it is industrially manufactured in multiple steps at high temperature and pressure, urgently motivating the design of a green and sustainable strategy for nitrate production. Herein, we report the photosynthesis of nitrate from N2 and O2 on commercial TiO2 in a flow reactor under ambient conditions. The TiO2 photocatalyst offered a high nitrate yield of 1.85 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 as well as a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13%. We combined reactivity and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanism of nitrate formation and unveil the special role of O2 in N&#8801;N bond dissociation. The mechanistic insight into charge&#8208;involved N2 oxidation was further demonstrated by in situ transient absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. This work exhibits the mechanistic origin of N2 photooxidation and initiates a potential method for triggering inert catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Modified Intramolecular&#8208;Lock Strategy Enables Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy is an appealing task for designing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, but only limited examples have been reported so far. Herein we present a &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy to develop TADF emitters for improving the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The installation of an electron&#8208;deficient heptagonal diimide lock onto a highly rotatable biphenyl&#8208;based emitter not only enhances electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor that decreases singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), but also endows the skeleton with modest rigidity and flexibility that increases photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in neat film. In particular, the integration of the diimide lock also leads to an increase in horizontal orientation factor (&#920;//) from 69% to 83%. Consequently, this modified intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy enables an efficient TADF emitter to assemble high&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a high external quantum efficiency of 26.2% and a power efficiency of 76.6 lm W&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough and Recyclable Ionogels Constructed by Coordinated Supramolecular Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanical properties of most hydrogels (ionogels) are considerably affected by covalently cross&#8208;linked networks. However, the interactions between solvent/solvent molecules and solvent/polymer chains are usually ignored. Herein, a series of ultra&#8208;tough ionogels were prepared via a supramolecular solvent, halometallate ionic liquid, in which cations and coordinating anions form a 3D supramolecular network. The linear polymer chains are physically cross&#8208;linked with supramolecular solvents synergistically enhancing the strength (14.3 MPa), toughness (78 MJ m&#8208;3), and Young's modulus (55 MPa) of ionogels, effectively dispersing the stress concentration under load, and obtaining better fatigue resistance and higher fracture energy (198 kJ m&#8208;2). Furthermore, the reversible cross&#8208;linking enables green recovery and recycling of ionogels, simply by water. This strategy shows broad applicability based on a variety of supramolecular solvents and coordinatable polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis of Urea with Nitrate and Carbon Dioxide over Iron&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient electrocatalysts to generate key *NH  2  and *CO intermediates is crucial for ambient urea electrosynthesis with nitrate (NO  3  &#8208;  ) and carbon dioxide (CO  2  ). Here we report a liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation method to fabricate symbiotic graphitic carbon encapsulated amorphous iron and iron oxide nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe  3  O  4  /CNTs). Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe  3  O  4  /CNTs exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis using NO  3  &#8208;  and CO  2  , affording a urea yield of 1341.3&#177;112.6 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  cat  &#8208;1  and a faradic efficiency of 16.5&#177;6.1% at ambient conditions. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe  3  O  4  on CNTs provide dual active sites for the adsorption and activation of NO  3  &#8208;  and CO  2  , thus generating key *NH  2  and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation. This work would be helpful for design and development of high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts for ambient urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Oxide Catalysts for Preferential Oxidation of CO in H2 with an Ultra&#8208;wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 (PROX) reaction is a promising solution to the on&#8208;board purification of CO&#8208;contaminated H2 fuel for use in next&#8208;generation proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). However, achieving high CO selectivity, activity and structural stability across the wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate centimeter scale interfacial PROX catalysts grown from nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline Pr2O3 and Nd2O3 monoliths with lattice surface&#8208;deposited Pt clusters at nanoscale. We demonstrate complete and selective removal of CO in H2 over an unprecedented wide temperature window (253&#8208;403 K). The monoliths are integrated with an operational PEMFC to purify the H2 fuel contaminated with CO (30 ppm) and enable stable power output for &gt;400 h; over two thousand times longer than without. This work demonstrates that the nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths can simultaneously achieve the stability and overall performance required to realize practically useful PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Nitroreductase Imaging via Fluorescence and Chemical Shift Dependent 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroreductase (NTR) is an important biomarker widely used to evaluate the degree of tumor hypoxia. Although a few optical methods have been reported for detecting nitroreductase at low concentration ranges, an effective strategy for nitroreductase monitoring in vivo without limits to the imaging depth is still lacking. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;mode NIR fluorescence and 19  F MRI agent, FCy7&#8208;NO 2  , is proposed for imaging tumor hypoxia. We show that FCy7&#8208;NO 2  serves as not only a rapid NIR fluorescence enhanced probe for monitoring bioimaging of nitroreductase in tumors, but also a novel 19  F MR chemical shift&#8208;sensitive contrast agent for selectively detecting nitroreductase catalyzed reduction. Notably, integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO 2  enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase in a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit. In general, this agent has a remarkable response to nitroreductase, which provides a promising method for understanding tumor evolution and its physiological role in the hypoxic microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <title>Host Spin&#8208;Crossover Thermodynamics Indicate Guest Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) metal&#8208;organic cages capable of switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states have the potential to be used as magnetic sensors and switches. Variation of the donor strength of heterocyclic aldehyde subcomponents in imine&#8208;based ligands can tune the ligand field for a FeII  center, which results in both homoleptic and heteroleptic cages with diverse SCO behaviors. The tetrahedral SCO cage built from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde is capable of encapsulating various guests, which stabilize different cage spin states depending on guest size. Conversely, the SCO tetrahedron exhibits different affinities for guests in different spin states, which is inferred to result from subtle structural differences of the cavity caused by the change in metal center spin state. Examination of SCO thermodynamics across a series of host&#8208;guest complexes enabled sensitive probing of guest fit to the host cavity, providing information complementary to binding&#8208;constant determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Hofmeister Anion Selectivity via a Mechanical Bond Effect in Neutral Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exceptionally strong halogen bonding (XB) donor&#8208;chloride interactions are exploited for the chloride anion template synthesis of neutral XB [2]rotaxane host systems which contain perfluoroaryl&#8208;functionalised axle components, including a remarkably potent novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif. Halide anion recognition properties in aqueous&#8208;organic media, determined via extensive 1H NMR halide anion titration experiments, reveal the rotaxane host systems exhibit dramatically enhanced affinities for hydrophilic Cl&#8208; and Br&#8208;, but conversely diminished affinities for hydrophobic I&#8208;, relative to their non&#8208;interlocked axle counterparts. Crucially, this mechanical bond effect induces a binding selectivity which directly opposes Hofmeister bias. Free&#8208;energy analysis of this mechanical bond enhancement demonstrates anion recognition by neutral XB interlocked host systems as a rare and general strategy to engineer anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias anion selectivity in synthetic receptor design.</dc:description>

         <title>The Function of Two Radical&#8208;SAM Enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, in the Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In biosynthesis of the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (1) is 3&#8208;methylated to form 2, then 4&#8208;guanylylated to form 3, and converted to the full cofactor. HcgA&#8208;G proteins catalyze biosynthetic reactions. Here, we report the function of two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, using in vitro complementation experiments and purified enzymes. In vitro biosynthesis using the cell extract from the Methanococcus maripaludis &#916;hcgA strain was complemented with HcgA or precursors 1, 2 or 3. The results suggested that HcgA catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction that forms 1. We demonstrated the formation of 1 by HcgA using the 3&#8208;kDa cell extract filtrate as the substrate. Biosynthesis in the &#916;hcgG system was recovered by HcgG but not by 3, which indicated that HcgG catalyzes the reactions after biosynthesis of 3. The data indicated that HcgG contributes to the formation of CO and completes biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor.</dc:description>

         <title>Control the Single&#8208;, Two&#8208;, and Three&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to control the single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence of metal nanoclusters. In this work, the control over the non&#8208;linear optics of metal nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished via exploiting the solvent effect. An emissive nanocluster, Au9Ag6(SPh t OMe)4(DPPOE)3Cl3, was synthesized and structurally determined. The solvent effect can not only control the fluorescence of this nanocluster, but more significantly, it can also regulate the photoluminescence nature of the cluster as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. We concluded that the increased solution polarity, improved dipole moment, enlarged HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, and reduced solution viscosity of the cluster in solutions endow them with excellent high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence. The results provide an intriguing cluster template that enables us to manipulate the linear and nonlinear optics at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrifying Adipic Acid Production: Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidation and C&#8208;C Cleavage of Cyclohexanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adipic acid is a central platform molecule for the polymer industry. Its production via the alternative electro&#8208;reforming technology to the thermochemical route points to a more sustainable process. Herein, we discovered that the incorporation of Cu2+ into the Ni hydroxide lattices significantly improved the electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate with a high yield (84%) and selectivity (87%). This Cu promotion effect could serve as a probe to combine with product analysis, steady&#8208;state kinetics and in situ spectroscopy to investigate the mechanism, which involves a first two&#8208;electron oxidation into cyclohexanone and then consecutive hydroxylation and C&#8208;C cleavage at early stages before the dione formation. The central role of Cu2+ is to weaken the interaction between the NiOOH and surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical that facilitates the subsequent C&#8208;C cleavage. This enables a highly efficient two&#8208;electrode system of electro&#8208;reforming KA oil into adipate and pure H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Suprasomes Based on Host&#8211;Guest Molecular Recognition: An Excellent Alternative to Liposome in Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes and polymersomes, typical vesicular drug delivery systems (DDSs), have faced some limitations in cancer theranostics. Suprasomes, supramolecular vesicles assembled from amphiphiles linked by noncovalent interactions, show potential as new generation of vesicular DDSs. We construct suprasomes based on host&#8211;guest recognition, by which the desired functions can be integrated into carriers without tedious synthesis. Photothermally active host&#8211;guest complex is formed between a functional guest and pillar[5]arene, which further self&#8208;assembles into hollow suprasomes. A supramolecular nanomedicine is developed by encapsulating cisplatin in the suprasomes. The obtained cisplatin@Suprasomes achieve excellent anticancer efficacy and anti&#8208;metastasis combining chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, which ablate the tumors without relapse and metastasis. This work demonstrates the facile functionalization of suprasomes, holding promise as alternatives to liposomes and polymersomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Liquids Responsive to Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous liquid is a unique liquid medium that combines cavity of porous solid with the fluidity of liquid, and this special characteristic makes it potential in various applications. Here we report the type II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) by dissolving photoresponsive metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (PMOP, constructed from dicopper and azobenzene&#8208;containing carboxylate) in polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;functionalized bulky ionic liquid (IL). Owing to favorable ion interactions, bulky IL molecules encircle outside PMOP, and the inter cavities are maintained. The azobenzene moieties can be isomerized freely in the obtained PPILs to expose and shelter active sites upon visible and UV light irradiations. Hence, the adsorption capacity of PPILs is controllable by light irradiation, and the change in CO2 uptake is up to 30% than neat IL with negligible change. This study may inspire the development of new adsorption process regulated by light instead of pressure and temperature swing adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>{Mo126W30}: Polyoxometalate Cages Shaped by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the formation of giant {Mo  126  W  30  } polyoxometalate cages templated by &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar ligands. Their inorganic shells incorporate arrays of 18 stacked aromatic carboxylates, such as 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate or 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate, and the assembly is stabilized by multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. NMR data confirmed that the cages are stable in solution and the inner aromatic templates can be postsynthetically replaced by selected aliphatic dicarboxylates, paving the way for endo&#8208;functionalization and exploration of the reactivities within the cage cavities.</dc:description>

NMR data confirmed that the cages are stable in solution and the inner aromatic templates can be postsynthetically replaced by selected aliphatic dicarboxylates, paving the way for endo-functionalization and exploration of the reactivities within the cage cavities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Programmed Separation of Hexane Isomers by Porous Calcium Chloranilate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The full separation of alkane isomers as a function of different degrees of branching remains a daunting challenge due to its stringent requirement with respect to pore dimensions of the adsorbents. In this work, we report a novel microporous coordination network built on calcium (II) and chloranilate. The compound has a flexible framework and exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior toward hexane isomers. At 30 &#176;C, it accommodates substantial amounts of linear and monobranched hexanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, and at elevated temperatures such as 150 &#176;C, it acts as a splitter for linear and branched alkanes. Its capability of efficient discrimination of hexane isomers as a function of branching is verified by experimental breakthrough measurements. Ab initio calculations have uncovered the underlying selective size&#8208;exclusion separation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides having a Domain Structure
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined heparan sulfate mimetics having a domain structure were synthesized by copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition of HS oligosaccharide having a terminal alkyne or azide moiety. Competition binding experiments demonstrated that the length of NA domains modulate the binding of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) has a domain structure in which regions that are modified by epimerization and sulfonation (NS domains) are interspersed by unmodified fragments (NA domains). There is data to support that domain organization of HS can regulate binding of proteins, however, such model has been difficult to probe. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide HS oligosaccharides composed of two or more NS domains separated by NA domains of different length. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a HS oligosaccharide that enzymatically was extended by various GlcA&#8208;GlcNAc units and terminated in GlcNAc having an azido moiety at C&#8208;6 position. HS oligosaccharides having an azide and alkyne moiety could be assembled by copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to give compounds having various NS domains separated by unsulfonated regions. Competition binding studies showed that the length of an NA domain modulates the binding of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Uptake Relationship Study of DABCYL Derivatives Linked to Cyclic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Live&#8208;Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides with DABCYL derivatives can enhance the formation of nucleation zones for small fluorescent cargoes. Structure variations of the DABCYL moiety significantly increased the cellular uptake efficiency of ubiquitin, resulting in efficient cytosolic transport at nanomolar concentrations.







Abstract
Modifying cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating deca&#8208;arginine (cR10) peptides with 4&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) improves the uptake efficiency of synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) cargoes into living cells. To probe the role of the DABCYL moiety, we performed time&#8208;lapse microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of fluorescent DABCYL&#8208;R10 to evaluate the impact on cell entry by the formation of nucleation zones. Furthermore, we performed a structure&#8211;uptake relationship study with 13 DABCYL derivatives coupled to CPP to examine their effect on the cell&#8208;uptake efficiency when conjugated to mono&#8208;Ub through disulfide linkages. Our results show that through structure variations of the DABCYL moiety alone we could reach, at nanomolar concentration, an additional threefold increase in the cytosolic delivery of Ub, which will enable studies on various intracellular processes related to Ub signaling.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Quadruple Borylation of Terminal Alkynes to Access sp3&#8208;Tetra&#8208;Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes is developed to prepare synthetically versatile 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through sequential 1,2&#8208;diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;catalyzed regioselective quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a copper catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). A wide range of terminal alkynes undergo this multi&#8208;borylation reaction to afford the corresponding 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes in high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential double 1,2&#8208;diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates. This protocol represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approach to prepare sp3&#8208;tetra&#8208;organometallic reagents from readily accessible alkynes with commercially available copper catalysts.

         <title>Anion Donicity of Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Carbon Fluoride Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium salt with a moderate donor number facilitates the electrochemical dissociation to the slightly ionic C&#8722;F bonds via a push&#8208;pull effect&#8212;moderate solvating power toward slightly positive&#8208;charged carbon atoms (push) and simultaneously ease in de&#8208;solvation for Li+&#8208;ions (pull). This effectively promotes the formation of graphitic carbon and crystalline LiF as discharge products, thereby boosting the specific capacity during discharge process.







Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy powers have greatly incentivized the development of lithium carbon fluoride (Li||CFx) cells. Five kinds of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes with various kinds of lithium salts (LiX, X=PF6&#8722;, TFSI&#8722;, BF4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, and CF3SO3&#8722;) were comparatively studied. Intriguingly, the LiBF4&#8208;based electrolyte show relatively moderate ionic conductivities; yet, the corresponding Li||CFx cells deliver the highest discharge capacities among them. A combination of morphological and compositional analyses of the discharge CFx cathode suggest that the moderate donicity of BF4&#8722; anion is accountable for favoring the breakdown of C&#8722;F bonds, and subsequently forming crystalline lithium fluoride as the main discharge products. This work brings not only fresh understanding on the role of salt anions for Li||CFx cells, but also inspire the electrolyte design for other conversion&#8208;type (sulfur and/or organosulfur) cathode materials desired for high&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Developing Isoxazole as a Native Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker for Photoaffinity Labeling and Chemoproteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoxazole is an essential pharmacophore in drug discovery. In this study, we investigated the photochemistry of isoxazole with biomolecules and developed it as a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics and drug discovery. With this strategy, two isoxazole&#8208;containing drugs were successfully applied to chemoproteomic platforms to uncover their cellular targets and interactions.







Abstract
Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique to interrogate drug&#8208;protein interactions in native cellular environments. Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers are instrumental for this technique. However, the introduction of unnatural photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers may significantly reduce the bioactivity of the drug, thus impairing the chemoproteomic outcomes. Herein, we developed a common pharmacophore, isoxazole, into a natively embedded photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linker for chemoproteomics, which minimally perturbs the drug structure. The photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking reactions of the isoxazole were thoroughly investigated for the first time. Functionalized isoxazoles were then designed and applied to protein labeling, demonstrating the superior photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking efficiency. Subsequently, two isoxazole&#8208;based drugs, Danazol and Luminespib, were employed in chemoproteomic studies, revealing their potential cellular targets. These results provide valuable strategies for future chemoproteomic study and drug development.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Edged [4]Triangulene: Facile Synthesis and Two&#8208;Dimensional On&#8208;Surface Self&#8208;Assemblies
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of [4]heterotriangulene with three oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (OBO) segments incorporated into the zigzag edges has been synthesized. The unprecedented OBO&#8208;doped [4]triangulene exhibits long&#8208;range ordered 2D nanoarchitectures on metal surfaces, with a substrate&#8208;dependent character that is superior to previous nanographene&#8208;based 2D assemblies and thus holds potential for future nanotechnological applications.







Abstract
Triangulenes have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science, but suffer from their high instability towards oxygen. Embedding heteroatoms into triangulenes provides a new class of ambient stable materials for various applications. However, [3]heterotriangulenes have dominated the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped triangulenes, while their higher homologues have been rarely explored. In this work, we synthesize a new [4]heterotriangulene with three oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (OBO) segments incorporated into the zigzag edges. The planar geometry of the OBO&#8208;doped [4]triangulene is demonstrated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Self&#8208;assembly on metal surfaces reveals substrate&#8208;dependent nanostructures, leading to different long&#8208;range ordered 2D patterns on Ag and Cu substrates with negligible defects.

         <title>Facet Engineering of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Support Modulates the Microenvironment of Palladium Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd nanoparticles supported on a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ZIF&#8208;8 with engineered crystal facets, followed by coating with a ZIF&#8208;8 layer, yielded a series of MOF composites. ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, featuring electron&#8208;deficient Pd with a unique microenvironment created by the exposed (100) crystal facet of the ZIF&#8208;8 support, favors adsorption of &#8722;NO2 over &#8722;Cl, and thus, high activity and selectivity in halonitrobenzene hydrogenation to haloaniline.







Abstract
The exposed facets of supported catalysts play a crucial role in catalysis; however, they are usually ignored and related studies remain rare. Herein, we have fabricated a series of sandwich&#8208;structured metal&#8211;organic framework composites, denoted ZIF&#8208;8X@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 (x represents the morphology of ZIF&#8208;8 core, i.e., ZIF&#8208;8C exposing (100) facet, ZIF&#8208;8RD exposing (110) facet, and ZIF&#8208;8TRD exposing mixed (100) and (110) facets), featuring Pd nanoparticles deposited on the specific crystal facets of ZIF&#8208;8 core, for hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. The Pd electronic state is tailored by the ZIF&#8208;8 core, where more electron&#8208;deficient Pd is found in ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 than that in ZIF&#8208;8RD@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, leading to discriminative adsorption of the &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;Cl groups of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. Consequently, ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits excellent activity (97.6&#8201;%) and selectivity (98.1&#8201;%) to p&#8208;chloroaniline. This work highlights crystal facet engineering of supports to modulate the microenvironment and electronic state of supported metal nanoparticles, offering a promising avenue to enhanced catalysis.

         <title>Endohedrally Functionalized Heteroleptic Coordination Cages for Phosphate Ester Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroleptic [Pd2A2B2] coordination cages was prepared by shape&#8208;complementary assembly (SCA) from a modular set of ligands and screened for binding phosphate guests. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that an endohedral hydrogen bond donor site is the decisive but not exclusive factor for binding phosphate diesters inside the cavity in a competitive solvent.







Abstract
Metallosupramolecular hosts of nanoscopic dimensions, which are able to serve as selective receptors and catalysts, are usually composed of only one type of organic ligand, restricting diversity in terms of cavity shape and functional group decoration. We report a series of heteroleptic [Pd2A2B2] coordination cages that self&#8208;assemble from a library of shape complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands in a non&#8208;statistical fashion. Ligands A feature an inward pointing NH function, able to engage in hydrogen bonding and amenable to being functionalized with amide and alkyl substituents. Ligands B comprise tricyclic aromatic backbones of different shape and electronic situation. The obtained heteroleptic coordination cages were investigated for their ability to bind phosphate diesters as guests. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent were conducted to understand the mechanistic relationships behind the experimentally determined guest affinities.

         <title>From Inert to Catalytically Active Milling Media: Galvanostatic Coating for Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The galvanostatic coating of milling balls and vessels advances commonly inert materials into catalytically active milling media. The coating sequence, the support material, and the layer thickness are crucial for achieving high activities in the Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction for multiple cycles. The interplay between the mechanical impact of the ball and the catalytically available surface is elucidated.







Abstract
The inert milling balls, commonly utilized in mechanochemical reactions, were coated with a layer of Pd and utilized as catalyst in the direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki reaction. With high yields (&gt;80&#8201;%), the milling balls can be recycled multiple times in the absence of any solvents, ligands, catalyst&#8208;molecules and &#8208;powders, while utilizing as little as 0.8&#8197;mg of Pd per coated milling ball. The coating sequence, the support material, and the layer thickness were examined towards archiving high catalyst retention, low abrasion and high conversion. The approach was transferred to the coating of milling vessels revealing the interplay between catalytically available surface area and the mechanical energy impact in direct mechanocatalysis.

         <title>Hierarchical Assembly of a Micro&#8208; and Macroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Tailored Single&#8208;Crystal Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a crystal of a porous organic material based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with hierarchical micro and macroporosity is reported. During the skeletal growth, the crystal size can be easily tailored from micro to centimetre scale while preserving the hierarchical porosity. We used the hierarchical porosity for the sequential co&#8208;recognition of microparticles and molecular species.







Abstract
Porous organic molecular materials represent an emergent field of research in Chemistry and Materials Science due to their unique combination of properties. To enhance their performance and expand the number of applications, the incorporation of hierarchical porosity is required, as exclusive microporosity entails several limitations. However, the integration of macropores in porous organic molecular materials is still an outstanding challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MM&#8208;TPY) with hierarchical skeletal morphology, containing stable micro&#8208; and macroporosity. The crystal size, from micro to centimetre scale, can be controlled in a single step without using additives or templates. The mechanism of assembly during the crystal formation is compatible with a skeletal crystal growth. As proof of concept, we employed the hierarchical porosity as a platform for the dual, sequential and selective co&#8208;recognition of molecular species and microparticles.

         <title>4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;Labeling Constitutes a Sensitive 19F NMR Probe for Characterization of Interactions in the Minor Groove of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thymidine modified with a 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 group exhibits a rather flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and is accommodated well by different higher order DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high 19F NMR sensitivity of 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;thymidine make it an excellent probe for quantitatively distinguishing various DNA structures and for monitoring the dynamics of DNA&#8208;protein interactions in the minor groove by means of 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Fluorinated nucleotides are invaluable for 19F NMR studies of nucleic acid structure and function. Here, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;thymidine (T
) and incorporated it into DNA by means of solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis. NMR studies showed that the 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 group exhibited a flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and was well accommodated by various higher order DNA structures. The three magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms in 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3&#8208;DNA constitute an isolated spin system, offering high 19F NMR sensitivity and excellent resolution of the positioning of T
 within various secondary and tertiary DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high sensitivity of T
 make it a valuable 19F NMR probe for quantitatively distinguishing diverse DNA structures with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution and for monitoring the dynamics of interactions in the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA.

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;based switchable supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switchable supercapacitors (SCs) enable a reversible electrically&#8208;driven uptake/release of bioactive ions by polarizing porous carbon electrodes. Herein we demonstrate the first example of a bioactive ion&#8208;based switchable supercapacitor. Based on choline chloride and porous carbons we unravel the mechanism of physisorption vs. electrosorption by nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman, and impedance spectroscopy. Weak physisorption facilitates electrically&#8208;driven electrolyte depletion enabling the controllable uptake/release of electrolyte ions. A new 4&#8208;terminal device is proposed, with a main capacitor and a detective capacitor for monitoring bioactive ion adsorption in situ. Ion&#8208;concentration control in printed choline&#8208;based switchable SCs realizes switching down to 8.3% residual capacitance. The exploration of adsorption mechanisms in printable microdevices will open an avenue of manipulating bioactive ions for the application of drug delivery, neuromodulation, or neuromorphic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the "Proton Lubricant"&#160;Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton insertion chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is becoming a research hotspot owing to its fast kinetics and additional capacities. However, H+ storage mechanism has not been deciphered in the popular MoS2&#8208;based AZIBs. Herein, we innovatively prepared a MoS2/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (MoS2/PEDOT) hybrid, where the intercalated PEDOT not only increases the interlayer spacing (from 0.62 to 1.29 nm) and electronic conductivity of MoS2, but also activates the proton insertion chemistry. Thus, highly efficient and reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors are demonstrated for the first time in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. More intriguingly, the co&#8208;inserted protons can act as lubricants to effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT host and divalent Zn2+, enabling the accelerated ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics and exceptional rate performance. This work proposes a new concept of "proton lubricant"&#160;driving Zn2+ transport and broadens the horizons of Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared Diffusion&#8208;Ordered&#160; Spectroscopy Reveals Molecular Size and Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by ideas from NMR, we have developed Infrared Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (IR&#8208;DOSY), which simultaneously characterizes molecular structure and size. We rely on the fact that the diffusion coefficient of a molecule is determined by its size through the Stokes&#8208;Einstein relation, and achieve sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient by creating a concentration gradient and tracking its equilibration in an IR&#8208;frequency resolved manner. Analogous to NMR&#8208;DOSY, a two&#8208;dimensional IR&#8208;DOSY spectrum has IR frequency along one axis and diffusion coefficient (or equivalently, size) along the other, so the chemical structure and the size of a compound are characterized simultaneously. In an IR&#8208;DOSY spectrum of a mixture, molecules with different sizes are nicely separated into distinct sets of IR peaks. Extending this idea to higher dimensions, we also perform 3D&#8208;IR&#8208;DOSY, in which we combine the conformation sensitivity of femtosecond multi&#8208;dimensional IR spectroscopy with size sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Constructed from a Tetrabenzaldehyde with a Carbazole N&#8208;H Binding Site for the&#160;Highly Selective Recognition and Separation of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with multiple functionalities is highly sought after but challenging. Herein, we report a multifunctional HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2) built from 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde molecule with tetrabenzaldeyde for their H bonding interactions and carbazole N&#8208;H site for its specific recognition of small molecules. The Lewis acid N&#8208;H sites allow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2 facilely separate acetone from its mixture with another solvent like methanol with smaller pKa value. The donor (D)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A) aromatic nature of the organic building molecule endows this HOF with solvent dependent luminescent/chromic properties, so the column acetone/methanol separation on HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2 can be readily visualized.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Electrolyte Chemistry and Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Reversible Ca Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of rechargeable Ca metal batteries (RCMBs) is hindered by the Ca2+ passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). The cation solvation structure dictated by electrolyte chemistry plays a critical role in the SEIs properties. While a relatively weak cation&#8208;solvent binding is preferred in Li metal anodes to promote anion&#8208;derived SEIs, we demonstrate an enhanced Ca deposition/stripping reversibility under a strong cation&#8208;solvent interaction, which is materialized in strongly&#8208;solvating solvent and highly&#8208;dissociated salt combinations. Such electrolyte formulations benefit the formation of solvent&#8208;occupied solvation structure and minimize the anion reduction, resulting in organic&#8208;rich/CaF2&#8208;poor SEIs for reversible Ca metal anodes. Furthermore, RCMBs paired with an organic cathode using the optimized electrolytes are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Our work reveals the paradigm shift in SEIs design for Ca metal anodes, opening up new opportunities for emerging RCMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonally Integrating Programmable Structural Color and Photo&#8208;rewritable Fluorescence in Hydrazone Photoswitch&#8208;bonded Cholesteric Liquid Crystalline Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design and fabrication of advanced security label showing superior performance in information storage and data encryption has attracted tremendous scientific interests. Especially, multifunctional optical labels capable of storing distinct information in different modes are highly demanded but challenging. Here, a fluorescent cholesteric liquid crystalline network (CLCN) film with programmable visible patterns and photo&#8208;rewritable fluorescent patterns was judiciously designed and prepared. The visible patterns were fixed by helical network and the colors of visible patterns were tunable over visible range by changing relative humidity (RH). The fluorescence patterns originated from dynamic isomerization of fluorescent hydrazone molecules, exhibiting highly thermal stability and switching&#8208;ability controlled by remote light irradiation. The orthogonal construction of visible pattern and fluorescent pattern enabled the novel CLCN to encrypt distinctive dynamic information in reflective mode and in emissive mode, indicating the potential in applications including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storages and encryptions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imines as Super Nucleophiles in Catalytic Coupling of Amides by CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of an extended class of stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (mNHIs), containing highly polarized exocyclic imine moiety is synthesized. The calculated proton affinities (PAs), and experimentally determined Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEP) reveal the highest basicity and donor ability of these synthesized mNHIs among the NHIs studied so far. The superior nucleophilicity of newly designed mNHIs was utilized in devising a strategy to incorporate CO2 as a bridging unit under deoxygenated conditions to couple inert primary amide molecules. Such a strategy was further extended for hetero&#8208;coupling between amide and amine using CO2. These hitherto unknown catalytic transformations were introduced in the diversification of various biologically active drug molecules under completely metal&#8208;free conditions. The underlying mechanism was explored by performing a series of control experiments, characterizing key intermediates using spectroscopic, and crystallographic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tight Host&#8208;Guest Binding with Exceptionally Strong Positive Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperativity plays a critical role in self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition. A rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle &#160;with a cyclodirectional backbone binds with DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests in a 2:1 ratio in high affinities (Ktotal ~1013 M&#8208;2) in the highly polar DMF. The host&#8208;guest binding also exhibits exceptionally strong positive cooperativity quantified by interaction factors &#945; that are among the largest for synthetic host&#8208;guest systems. The unusually strong positive cooperativity, revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fully corroborated by mass spectrometry, NMR and computational studies, is driven by guest&#8208;induced stacking of the macrocycles and stabilization from the alkyl end chains of the guests, interactions that appear upon binding the second macrocycle. With its tight binding driven by extraordinary positive cooperativity, this host&#8208;guest system provides a tunable platform for studying molecular interactions and for constructing stable supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Switch Drives Selective C&#8722;S Bond Formation by the Non&#8208;heme Sulfoxide Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron EgtB is a sulfoxide synthase that catalyzes the oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the synthesis of ergothioneine which plays roles against oxidative stress in cells. Despite the extensive experimental and computational studies of the catalytic mechanisms of EgtB, the root causes for the selective C&#8722;S bond formation remain elusive. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we show here that coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of the nonheme iron EgtB. Such coordination switch from S to O atom is driven by the S/&#960; electrostatic interactions, which promotes efficiently the observed stereoselective C&#8208;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation.  The present mechanism is in agreement with all available experimental data, including regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and KIE results  . This match underscores the critical role of coordination switch in catalysis of non&#8208;heme enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Promiscuity of Cyclohexanone Monooxygenase for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral fluorinated compounds has been a long&#8208;term challenge. Herein, we reported a photo&#8208;induced promiscuous cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) for the synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones via enantioselective reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones. Wild&#8208;type CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. possesses this promiscuous ability innately, however, the yield and stereoselectivity are low. Structure&#8208;guided rational design of CHMO improved the yield and stereoselectivity remarkably. Mechanistic studies and molecular simulations demonstrated that this photoinduced CHMO catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation via a novel electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) mechanism, distinct from the previously reported reductases with similar promiscuity. This methodology was expanded to various substrates, and desirable chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones with high yields (up to 99%) and e.r. values were achieved (up to 99: 1).</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Protein with Improved Thermal Stability by an Evolution&#8208;Based Generative Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient design of functional proteins with higher thermal stability remains challenging especially for highly diverse sequence variants. Considering the evolutionary pressure on protein folds, sequence design optimizing evolutionary fitness could help designing folds with higher stability. Using a generative evolution fitness model trained to capture variation patterns in natural sequences, we designed artificial sequences of a proteinaceous inhibitor of pectin methylesterase enzymes. These inhibitors have considerable industrial interest to avoid phase separation in fruit juice manufacturing or reduce methanol in distillates, averting chromatographic passages triggering unwanted aroma loss. Six out of seven designs with up to 30% divergence to other inhibitor sequences are functional and two have improved thermal stability. This method can improve protein stability expanding functional protein sequence space, with traits valuable for industrial applications and scientific research.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet&#8208;specific Active Surface Regulation of BixMOy (M=Mo, V, W) Nanosheets for Boosted Photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic performance can be optimized via introduction of reactive sites. However, it is practically difficult to engineer these on specific photocatalyst surfaces, because of limited understanding of atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity. Here we report a facile sonication&#8208;assisted chemical reduction for specific facets regulation via oxygen deprivation on Bi&#8208;based photocatalysts. The modified Bi2MoO6 nanosheets exhibit 61.5 and 12.4 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 for CO and CH4 production respectively, ~3 times greater than for pristine catalyst, together with excellent stability/reproducibility of ~20 h. By combining advanced characterizations and simulation, we confirm the reaction mechanism on surface&#8208;regulated photocatalysts, namely, induced defects on highly&#8208;active surface accelerate charge separation/transfer and lower the energy barrier for surface CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction. Promisingly, this method appears generalizable to a wider range of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Transitions in Chemically Fueled, Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling multiphase coacervate droplets to a chemical reaction cycle allows access to regimes inside the phase diagram not possible under thermodynamic control. Control over the stability, liquidity, and localization of the multiphases makes it a great synthetic platform to study the organization of membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Membraneless organelles are droplets in the cytosol that are regulated by chemical reactions. Increasing studies suggest that they are internally organized. However, how these subcompartments are regulated remains elusive. Herein, we describe a complex coacervate&#8208;based model composed of two polyanions and a short peptide. With a chemical reaction cycle, we control the affinity of the peptide for the polyelectrolytes leading to distinct regimes inside the phase diagram. We study the transitions from one regime to another and identify new transitions that can only occur under kinetic control. Finally, we show that the chemical reaction cycle controls the liquidity of the droplets offering insights into how active processes inside cells play an important role in tuning the liquid state of membraneless organelles. Our work demonstrates that not only thermodynamic properties but also kinetics should be considered in the organization of multiple phases in droplets.

         <title>Counter Electrode Reactions&#8212;Important Stumbling Blocks on the Way to a Working Electro&#8208;organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every electrochemical synthesis is paired with conversion at the counter electrode. In electro&#8208;organic synthesis, often only the desired half reaction is described well, although good control over the counter reaction is essential. In this Review, the impact of the counter electrode reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted through a collection of common and unusual counter reactions.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has gained significant interest, both in technical and academic research as well as in terms of applications. The omission of stoichiometric oxidizers or reducing agents enables a more sustainable route for redox reactions in organic chemistry. Even if it is well&#8208;known that every electrochemical oxidation is only viable with an associated reduction reaction and vice versa, the relevance of the counter reaction is often less addressed. In this Review, the importance of the corresponding counter reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted and how it can affect the performance and selectivity of the electrolytic conversion. A selection of common strategies and unique concepts to tackle this issue are surveyed to provide a guide to select appropriate counter reactions for electro&#8208;organic synthesis.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Transient Chirality Transfer and Atroposelective C&#8208;H Functionalization to Access Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed via catalytic transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer strategy. More importantly, this annulation represents a rare example of construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through tandem PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation process.







Abstract
Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization and Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of PdII&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.

         <title>Kinetic Co&#8208;assembly Pathway Induced Chirality Inversion Along with Morphology Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the self&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF) is insensitive to the pathway followed, the co&#8208;assembly of LPF with naphthylamine derivatives is pathway&#8208;dependent. The helical nanofibers of LPF transform into diverse kinetically trapped chiral structures with opposite chirality through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway (pathway B), while only thermodynamically stable nonhelical structures are formed by the thermodynamic pathway (pathway&#8197;A).







Abstract
Kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway induced chirality inversion along with morphology transition is of importance to understand biological processes, but still remains a challenge to realize in artificial systems. Herein, helical nanofibers consisting of phenylalanine&#8208;based enantiomers (L/DPF) successfully transform into kinetically trapped architectures with opposite helicity through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway. By contrast, the co&#8208;assemblies obtained by a thermodynamic pathway exhibit non&#8208;helical structures. The formation sequence of non&#8208;covalent interactions plays a crucial role in structural chirality of co&#8208;assemblies. For the kinetic pathway, the hydrogen bonding between D/LPF and naphthylamide derivatives forms before &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking to facilitate the formation of helical structures with inverse handedness. This study may provide an approach to explore chirality inversion accompanied by morphology transition by manipulating the kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway.

         <title>Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative sulfinylation is reported by Oleg&#8197;V. Larionov and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210525), as illustrated in the cover picture. The reaction is enabled by radicalophilic reactivity of sulfinyl sulfones shown in the top left that is distinct from the known dissociation and nucleophilic substitution pathways. Given the importance of carboxylic acids and sulfoxides for medicinal chemistry, agroscience, and organic synthesis, decarboxylative sulfination addresses the unmet need for a direct interconversion between the two functional groups and provides access to new sulfoxide chemical space.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase&#8221;

Abstract
Soellner published on the interplay between allosteric and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;competitive inhibitors of ABL kinase, showing that the latter preferably binds to different conformational states of ABL compared to allosteric agents that specifically target the ABL myristate pocket (STAMP) and deducing that asciminib cannot bind to ABL simultaneously with ATP&#8208;competitive drugs. These results are to some extent in line with ours, although our analyses of dose&#8211;response matrices from combinations of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib, show neither synergy nor antagonism, but suggest additive antiproliferative effects on BCR&#8208;ABL&#8208;dependent KCL22 cells. Furthermore, our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that asciminib can bind ABL concomitantly with type&#8208;1 or &#8208;2 ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors to form ternary complexes. Concomitant binding of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib might translate to benefit some chronic myeloid leukaemia patients.

         <title>A Photoelectrochemical Nanoreactor for Single&#8208;Cell Sampling and Near Zero&#8208;Background Faradaic Detection of Intracellular microRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical nanoreactor was devised for single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background faradic detection of intracellular microRNA. This platform provided a new perspective for exploring light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay toward single&#8208;cell studies.







Abstract
Rational utilization of the rich light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay taking place in single&#8208;cell analysis represents a new technological direction in the field. The light&#8208;fueled operation is expected to achieve advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) single&#8208;cell analysis with unknown possibilities. Here, a PEC nanoreactor capable of single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background Faradaic detection of intracellular microRNA (miR) is devised by the construction of a small reaction chamber accommodating the target&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction for binding the metallointercalator of [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ as the signal reporter. Light stimulation of the dsDNA/metallointercalator adduct will induce the generation of photocurrents, underpinning a zero&#8208;biased and near zero&#8208;background PEC method toward Faradaic detection of non&#8208;electrogenic miR at the single&#8208;cell level. Using this nanotool, lower miR concentration in the near&#8208;nucleus region than that in the main cytosol was revealed.

         <title>A Synthetic Cycle for Heteroarene Synthesis by Nitride Insertion
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An osmium nitride is shown to insert nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. A synthetic cycle to regenerate the starting nitride is presented alongside mechanistic studies of each step.







Abstract
Recent interest in skeletal editing necessitates the continued development of reagent classes with the ability to transfer single atoms. Terminal transition metal nitrides hold immense promise for single&#8208;atom transfer, though their use in organic synthesis has so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a synthetic cycle with associated detailed mechanistic studies that primes the development of terminal transition metal nitrides as valuable single&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Specifically, we show [cis&#8208;terpyOsNCl2]PF6 inserts nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. Mechanistic studies for each step (insertion, aromatization, product release, and nitride regeneration) are reported, including crystallographic characterization of diverted intermediates, kinetics, and computational studies. The mechanistic foundation set by this synthetic cycle opens the door to the further development of nitrogen insertion heteroarene syntheses promoted by late transition metal nitrides.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Alcohols via Nickel Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alcohols B is presented by exploiting the condensation of iodoarenes and the redox active ether A via cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. A mechanistic study was conducted using a comprehensive computational investigation that was also supported by ad hoc control experiments and showed that the key 1,2&#8208;HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) event results in the formation of a C&#8208;centered radical C&#8242; that mimics the reactivity of trifluoroacetaldehyde.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between the redox&#8208;active N&#8208;trifluoroethoxyphthalimide and iodoarenes is documented. The protocol reproduces a formal arylation of trifluoroacetaldehyde under mild conditions in high yields (up to 88&#8201;%) and with large functional group tolerance (30 examples). A combined computational and experimental investigation revealed a pivotal solvent assisted 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) process to generate a nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl C&#8208;centered radical for the Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bond forming process.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Lanthanide Molecular Probes for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we developed clickable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling. In combination with metabolic labeling, these NIR Ln (Ln=Yb, Er) complexes enabled NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of proteins, glycans, and nucleic acids in cells. Furthermore, they were applied for multicolor imaging and NIR click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM). By combining these Ln probes with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), we achieved the first dual&#8208;modal NIRF&#8208;SIMS imaging.







Abstract
We report here the development of clickable and highly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling of biomolecules. These azide&#8208; or alkyne&#8208;functionalized Ln complexes are hydrophilic and fluorogenic, exhibiting a strong increase of NIR fluorescence upon conjugation with biomolecules. Metabolic labeling of biomolecules with azide or alkyne, followed by click labeling with the Ln complexes, enables NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans in cells. Furthermore, multicolor imaging is performed by combining click&#8208;labeling with the Ln complexes and immunostaining. In addition, the Ln complexes is compatible with click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM), which enables high&#8208;resolution NIRF imaging of cellular glycoproteins. Finally, the Ln complexes can be used for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging, thus achieving the first example of dual&#8208;modal imaging combining NIRF and SIMS microscopies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report here the development of clickable and highly near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling of biomolecules. These azide- or alkyne-functionalized Ln complexes are hydrophilic and fluorogenic, exhibiting a strong increase of NIR fluorescence upon conjugation with biomolecules. Metabolic labeling of biomolecules with azide or alkyne, followed by click labeling with the Ln complexes, enables NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans in cells. Furthermore, multicolor imaging is performed by combining click-labeling with the Ln complexes and immunostaining. In addition, the Ln complexes is compatible with click-expansion microscopy (click-ExM), which enables high-resolution NIRF imaging of cellular glycoproteins. Finally, the Ln complexes can be used for time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) imaging, thus achieving the first example of dual-modal imaging combining NIRF and SIMS microscopies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One and Two&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Symmetry&#8208;Reduced AIEgen&#8208;Ligand</title>

A symmetry&#8208;reduced TPE&#8208;cored ligand was applied for the construction of MOFs with dense packing structures, which are beneficial to the improvement of one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescent properties, achieving high TPA cross&#8208;sections of &#8776;3000&#8197;GM.







Abstract
By designing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based AIEgen&#8208;ligand with reduced symmetry, we obtained two alkaline&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based MOFs (LIFM&#8208;102 and LIFM&#8208;103) with dense packing structures and low porosity as proved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and CO2 sorption data. Excitingly, the desolvated MOFs with rigid environment and reduced lattice free solvent exhibit high quantum yields (QY, 64.9&#8201;% and 79.4&#8201;%) and excellent two&#8208;photon excited photoluminescence (TPA cross&#8208;sections, 2946.6&#8197;GM and 2899.0&#8197;GM), while maintaining the external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties suitable for anticounterfeit fields. The effect of ligand conformation was validated by comparing the structure and fluorescence properties of the samples before and after desolvation and further verified by theoretical calculations. This work expands the study on TPE&#8208;cored materials to symmetry&#8208;reduced ligand and might bring forward novel structures and excellent photoluminescent properties in the future.

         <title>Simultaneous Photoactivation of cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway and Pyroptosis by Platinum(II) Triphenylamine Complexes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small molecule that can activate cGAS&#8208;STING in a photocontrollable way is reported. Upon irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 can damage mitochondrial DNA, the nuclear envelope and nuclear DNA sequentially, which effectively releases DNA into cytoplasm to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway is a potent anticancer immunotherapeutic strategy, and the induction of pyroptosis is a feasible way to stimulate the anticancer immune responses. Herein, two PtII complexes (Pt1 and Pt2) were designed as photoactivators of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In response to light irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 could damage mitochondrial/nuclear DNA and the nuclear envelope to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and concurrently induce pyroptosis in cancer cells, which evoked an intense anticancer immune response in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Overall, we present the first photoactivator of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, which may provide an innovative design strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Surface Diffusion Aided by a Chirality Change of Self&#8208;Assembled Oligomers under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new functional molecular system with a combination of several advanced features, including a self&#8208;assembled oligomer, surface chirality, chirality switching, and finally their motion on the surface. Our results suggest that nonchiral molecules may be designed to induce switchable enantiomeric surface assemblies, relevant for heterogeneous catalysts.







Abstract
Chirality switching of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures is of potential interest for designing functional materials but is restricted by the strong interaction between the embedded molecules. Here, we report on an unusual approach based on reversible chirality changes of self&#8208;assembled oligomers using variable&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations. Six functionalized diazomethanes each self&#8208;assemble into chiral wheel&#8208;shaped oligomers on Ag(111). At 130&#8197;K, a temperature far lower than expected, the oligomers change their chirality even though the molecules reside in an embedded self&#8208;assembled structure. Each chirality change is accompanied by a slight center&#8208;of&#8208;mass shift. We show how the identical activation energies of the two processes result from the interplay of the chirality change with surface diffusion, findings that open the possibility of implementing various functional materials from self&#8208;assembled supramolecular structures.

         <title>Quantifying the Solution Structure of Metal Nanoclusters Using Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can directly quantify the overall structure parameters of nanoclusters in solution without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization. A series of silver and gold nanoclusters were studied with SANS demonstrating good agreement with crystallographic data in both the shape, size and the molecular weight information.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters are a unique class of synthetic material, as their crystal structures can be resolved using X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their chemical formula can be precisely determinated from mass spectroscopy. However, a complete structure characterization by these two techniques is often a challenging task. Here, we utilize small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) to directly quantify the key structure parameters of a series of silver and gold nanoclusters in solution. The results not only correlate well to their crystallographic structures, but also allow the quantification of the counterions layer surrounding charged nanoclusters in solution. Furthermore, when combining with X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to estimate the molecular weight of both the metal core and the ligand shell of nanoclusters. This work offers an alternative characterization tool for nanoclusters without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Accessibility and Reproducibility of Worm&#8208;like Micelles by In Situ Crosslinking Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greatly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles (W) is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), leading to significantly improved reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles. The reliability of the methodology has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems with different formulations of monomers, macro RAFT agents, crosslinkers, solvents, and polymerization temperatures.







Abstract
Worm&#8208;like micelles have attracted great interest due to their anisotropic structures. However, the experimental conditions for obtaining worm&#8208;like micelles are very restricted, which usually causes seriously poor reproducibility. In this work, significantly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is greatly improved due to the significantly enlarged experimental windows of worm&#8208;like micelles in the morphology diagram. Moreover, the reliability of the methodology to enhance the accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems.

     alt="Greatly Enhanced Accessibility and Reproducibility of Worm-like Micelles by In Situ Crosslinking Polymerization-Induced Self-Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greatly enhanced accessibility of worm-like micelles (W) is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA), leading to significantly improved reproducibility of worm-like micelles. The reliability of the methodology has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems with different formulations of monomers, macro RAFT agents, crosslinkers, solvents, and polymerization temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worm-like micelles have attracted great interest due to their anisotropic structures. However, the experimental conditions for obtaining worm-like micelles are very restricted, which usually causes seriously poor reproducibility. In this work, significantly enhanced accessibility of worm-like micelles is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). The reproducibility of worm-like micelles is greatly improved due to the significantly enlarged experimental windows of worm-like micelles in the morphology diagram. Moreover, the reliability of the methodology to enhance the accessibility of worm-like micelles has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems. The greatly enhanced accessibility and reproducibility of worm-like micelles is undoubtedly cost-effective especially in scale-up production, which paves the way for further application of worm-like micelles with various compositions and functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Colloidal Jamming by Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembled Polymers: A Robust Route for Ultrahigh Efficient Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic polymers blocks the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids giving an efficient protein and peptide encapsulation. Profiting from the high mass fraction of therapeutics (58.3&#8197;wt%), the mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times lower than that with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones. One injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites held the blood glucose level within normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
The control of cargo phase&#8208;transfer is of interest for many applications in science and technology. Herein, we report a simple, versatile and robust method to block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids by interfacial self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic polymer molecules. After simply increasing the concentration of amphiphilic polymers, the orientation of interfacial polymer molecules changed from flat to upright, forming a thick three&#8208;dimensional polymer layer at the oil&#8208;water interface. Even under fierce external force, this thick interfacial layer robustly prevented the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids, resulting in an ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency (up to 97.1&#8201;%) for proteins and peptides. One single injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites (58.3&#8197;wt%) kept the blood glucose level within the normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days in type&#8197;1 diabetic rats. The mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times smaller than that of microcomposites prepared with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones.

         <title>Anticancer Approach Inspired by the Hepatotoxic Mechanism of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids with Glycosylated Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. We developed a therapeutic approach, in which a precursor is transformed into a synthetic DHP via 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization catalyzed by a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM). In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a glycosylated ArM suppressed cell growth of targeted cancer cells.







Abstract
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA&#8208;induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization using a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450. In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a cancer&#8208;targeting glycosylated gold&#8208;based ArM substantially suppressed cell growth of the targeted cancer cells without causing cytotoxicity to untargeted cells, highlighting the potential of the strategy to be used therapeutically in vivo.

         <title>Torsional Strain&#8208;Independent Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides is reported. Under auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, both tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls were obtained in high yields and enantioselectivities. These products could be converted to bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies provided key insights into the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile bridged biaryls is emerging as a powerful strategy for atropisomer synthesis. However, the reported examples suffer from an inherent challenge as the reactivity is highly dependent on the torsional strain of the biaryl substrates, which significantly narrows down the scope and hampers the application. Herein, we report our discovery and development of a torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides. By employing auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, a universal synthesis of both tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted thiazole&#8208;containing biaryls was realized in high yields with high enantioselectivities. In addition, these products could be facilely converted to a novel type of bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.

         <title>[8]Cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine as a Super&#8208;Cyclooctatetraene: Dynamic Behavior, Global Aromaticity, and Open&#8208;Shell Diradical Character in the Neutral and Dicationic States</title>

         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;cyclooctatetraene, one new core&#8208;expanded analogue of cyclooctatetraene, has been synthesized by insertion of a benzenoid/quinoid C6H4 unit into each C&#8722;C bond. The neutral molecule shows three dynamic processes on the NMR time scale and non&#8208;aromatic character, whereas its dication exhibits enhanced planarity, global aromatic, and open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
An [8]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative ([8]CPPM&#8208;Mes) was synthesized. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a tub&#8208;shaped geometry similar to the cyclooctatetraene, with alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclosed a slow valence tautomerization process with an interconversion energy barrier of about 11.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at coalescence temperature (273&#8197;K), and two more lower&#8208;barrier dynamic processes involving flipping of the 1,4&#8208;phenyl rings on the backbone and rotation of the mesityl substituents. Its dication ([8]CPPM&#8208;Mes2+) adopts a bowl&#8208;like geometry with a smaller depth of the cavity, and a slow bowl inversion process was observed by dynamic NMR. The bond lengths of the benzenoid/quinoid rings are more averaged via electron delocalization and the molecule shows global aromaticity, which was further validated by NMR and theoretical analysis. [8]CPPM&#8208;Mes2+ exhibits open&#8208;shell diradical character with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8722;1.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

[Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; and derivatives have been comprehensively characterized. Fast formation, remarkable stability, and strong accumulation in AR42J tumour make 213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; an outstanding candidate for TAT.







Abstract
Targeted &#945; therapy (TAT) is a promising tool in the therapy of cancer. The radionuclide 213BiIII shows favourable physical properties for this application, but the fast and stable chelation of this metal ion remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the mesocyclic chelator AAZTA quickly coordinates BiIII at room temperature, leading to a robust complex. A comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of [Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; is reported, along with bifunctional [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;COO&#8722;)]2&#8722; and the targeted agent [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;, which incorporates the SSR agonist Tyr3&#8208;octreotate. An unexpected increase in the stability and kinetic inertness of the metal chelate was observed for the bifunctional derivative and was maintained for the peptide conjugate. A cyclotron&#8208;produced 205/206Bi mixture was used as a model of 213Bi in labelling, stability, and biodistribution experiments, allowing the efficiency of [213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; to be estimated. High accumulation in AR42J tumours and reduced kidney uptake were observed with respect to the macrocyclic chelate [213Bi(DOTA&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;.

         <title>The Growth Mechanism of a Conductive MOF Thin Film in Spray&#8208;based Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limited and self&#8208;repairing growth mechanism was demonstrated for the preparation of LBL&#8208;LPE thin films. The method provides a high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientation at its bottom part.







Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid&#8208;phase epitaxy (LBL&#8208;LPE) method is widely used in preparing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) thin films with the merits of controlling thickness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation for superior performances in applications. The LBL&#8208;LPE growth mechanism related to the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation is critical but very challenging to study. In this work, a novel &#8220;in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limiting and self&#8208;repairing&#8221; thin&#8208;film growth mechanism is demonstrated by the combination study of the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation of Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;xC thin film via microscopic analysis techniques and electrical measurements. This mechanism results a desired high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientations at its bottom for the first time and is very helpful for optimizing the LBL&#8208;LPE method, understanding the growth cycle&#8208;dependent properties of MOF thin film, and inspiring the investigations of the biomimetic self&#8208;repairing materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metal Clusters on 2D Ordered Mesoporous TiO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets have been synthesized by a universal sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy. The resultant catalyst shows unique chemical state and nanostructures, enabling a high catalytic activity, selectivity, poison tolerance and stability for the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene.







Abstract
A sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy is presented for the synthesis of fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 (SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2) nanosheets. This synthesis features the introduction of the sulfhydryl group in monomicelles to finely realize the controllable co&#8208;assembly process of Pt precursors within ordered mesostructures. The resultant SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows uniform SAL Pt clusters (&#8776;1.2&#8197;nm) anchored in ultrathin 2D nanosheets (&#8776;7&#8197;nm) with a high surface area (139&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), a large pore size (&#8776;25&#8197;nm) and a high dispersion (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Moreover, this strategy is universal for the synthesis of other SAL metal clusters (Pd and Au) on 2D mTiO2 with high exposure and accessibility. When used as a catalyst for hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene, the SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows a high catalytic activity (TOF up to 2424&#8197;h&#8722;1), 100&#8201;% selectivity for 4&#8208;aminostyrene, good stability, and anti&#8208;resistance to thiourea poisoning under relatively mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 10&#8197;bar).

         <title>Modulating Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions in the Solid State using Compressible Macrocyclic Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cavity compressing strategy is proposed to modulate the macrocyclic host&#8211;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions. The solid&#8208;state CT affinities of perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene toward various electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form.







Abstract
Modulating intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) interactions between specific donor and acceptor species in host&#8211;guest systems is a big challenge and full of research value in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, a strategy to modulate the supramolecular ICT interactions in the solid state is developed by compressing the binding cavity of a macrocyclic host named perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene (p&#8208;EtLP6). The solid&#8208;state ICT affinities of p&#8208;EtLP6 toward multi&#8208;types of electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form (m&#8208;EtLP6). X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses incorporating theoretical calculation demonstrate that the improved ICT affinities are mainly attributed to the superior host&#8211;guest size fit arising from the compressed binding cavity in m&#8208;EtLP6 as compared with p&#8208;EtLP6.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Tubular Conjugated Polymer 2D Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with tubular channels were prepared by self&#8208;assembly followed by UV irradiation of amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes in aqueous solution. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling and colorimetric DNA sensing was demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets.







Abstract
Creation of new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures has attracted significant attention in the field of self&#8208;assembly for structural diversity and new functionalization. Although numerous 2D polymer nanosheets have been reported, 2D nanosheets with tubular channels have been unexplored. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the fabrication of stimulus&#8208;responsive conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with hollow cavities. Amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes self&#8208;assembled in an aqueous solution in a columnar manner to afford bilayered 2D nanosheets with intrinsically tubular nanochannels. UV&#8208;induced polymerization resulted in the generation of blue&#8208;colored tubular conjugated polydiacetylene 2D nanosheets. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling with FRET phenomenon and colorimetric DNA sensing were demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets. In addition, the free NH2 containing polymerized 2D nanosheet was utilized for conductivity behavior and grafting on graphene oxide (GO).

         <title>Understanding the Nature and Strength of Noncovalent Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new series of fullerene&#8208;based molecular torsion balances and examined their folding equilibrium to understand the nature and strength of noncovalent face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8722;fullerene interactions. The contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions were experimentally quantified by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.







Abstract
Face&#8208;to&#8208;face noncovalent arene&#8722;fullerene interactions are important in several research fields such as synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and medicinal chemistry; however, their nature and strength are still poorly understood. In this study, we prepare a fullerene&#8208;based torsion balance containing thioanisole, phenol, naphthalene, azulene, and pyrene moieties as a unimolecular model system. Moreover, we compare the folding free energies between the folded and the unfolded conformers of a series of the molecular torsion balances to quantify noncovalent interactions between arenes and the fullerene surface. This work demonstrates that the contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions can be experimentally measured by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Perovskite Vertical Growth for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene nanosheets introduced to SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells maximize the interface matching between SnO2 and perovskite and induce vertically aligned crystal growth. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved by 15&#8201;%, reaching 23.07&#8201;%, and the short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, an unencapsulated device maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 500&#8197;h of storage in ambient air.







Abstract
Defects at the interfaces of perovskite (PVK) thin films are the main factors responsible for instability and low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVK solar cells (PSCs). Here, a SnO2&#8208;MXene composite electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PSCs to improve interfacial contact and passivate defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The introduced MXene regulates SnO2 dispersion and induces a vertical growth of PVK. The lattice matching of MXene and perovskite suppresses the concentration of interfacial stress, thereby obtaining a perovskite film with low defects. Compared with SnO2&#8208;based device, the PCE of SnO2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based device is improved by 15&#8201;% and its short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after 500&#8197;h of storage at 30&#8211;40&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.

         <title>Orthogonal Charge Transfer by Precise Positioning of Silver Single Atoms and Clusters on Carbon Nitride for Efficient Piezocatalytic Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;C2N2 single&#8208;sites and Ag clusters are co&#8208;confined on carbon nitride (CN). The enhanced in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization by Ag single atoms and rapid out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transfer between Ag clusters and CN collectively contribute to the excellent piezocatalytic pure water splitting.







Abstract
Developing efficient piezocatalytic systems for two&#8208;electron water splitting (TEWS) with producing H2 and H2O2 shows great promise to meet the industrial demand. Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co&#8208;anchored on carbon nitride (AgSA+C&#8722;CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, AgSA+C&#8722;CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain. Consequently, a superior H2 and H2O2 evolution rate of 7.90&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 5.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 is delivered by AgSA+C&#8722;CN, respectively, far exceeding that of the previously reported piezocatalysts. This work not only presents the SAs decoration as an available polarization enhancement strategy, but also sheds light on the superiority of multi&#8208;sites engineering in piezocatalysis.

They served as heterogeneous catalysts for photo&#8208;induced PET&#8208;RCMP under visible light irradiation, realizing efficient polymerization in both oil and aqueous solvent, producing polymers with low molecular weight dispersity and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Two imine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalysts with different building units, TPB&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF and TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF, for photo&#8208;induced energy transfer reversible complexation&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (PET&#8208;RCMP) were developed and investigated, producing ideal polymers with accurate molecular weight and moderate dispersity under visible light irradiation. The chain extension and spatiotemporal control experiments revealed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of polymers and the compatibility of RCMP processes in both bulk and aqueous system. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that heteroatom&#8208;doped TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibits higher activities for weakening C&#8722;I bond energy barrier, which promotes PET&#8208;RCMP polymerization performance. This work demonstrates that rational adjustment of building block for constructing COF heterogeneous photocatalyst can enhance the catalytic performance of PET&#8208;RCMP, providing a design methodology for the development of polymeric organic photoelectric semiconductor catalysts to mediate RCMP.

         <title>An Atypical Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Enables Efficient Biosynthesis of Extender Units for Engineering a Polyketide Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (ACS, UkaQ) with broad substrate specificity and an unusual catalytic mode was identified. Its stability and catalytic activity were remarkably improved by protein engineering, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs. In combination with permissive carboxylases, diverse extender units were synthesized and used to engineer the polyketide carbon scaffold of antimycin.







Abstract
Acyl&#8208;CoAs are key precursors of primary and secondary metabolism. Their efficient biosynthesis is often impeded by the limited substrate specificity and low in vivo activity of acyl&#8208;CoA synthetases (ACSs) due to regulatory acylation of the catalytically important lysine residue in motif A10 (Lys&#8208;A10). In this study, we identified an unusual ACS (UkaQ) from the UK&#8208;2A biosynthetic pathway that naturally lacks the Lys&#8208;A10 residue and exhibits extraordinarily broad substrate specificity. Protein engineering significantly improved its stability and catalytic activity, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs with highly robust activity. By combining it with permissive carboxylases, we produced a large array of polyketide extender units and obtained six novel halobenzyl&#8208;containing antimycin analogues through an engineered biosynthetic pathway. This study significantly expands the catalytic mode of ACSs and provides a potent tool for the biosynthesis of acyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived natural products.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxycarbonylation of Alkyl Bromides via a Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct alkoxycarbonylation pattern via an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; catalyst is reported. This low&#8208;valent iron catalyst activates alkyl halides via a two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, unlike previous reports where alkyl halides underwent a single electron transfer (SET). This reaction provides easy and efficient access to esters, and its mechanism will provide new ideas for the activation of alkyl halides in the field of carbonylation.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are some of the most widely used methods in organic synthesis. However, despite the obvious advantages of iron as an abundant and low toxicity transition metal catalyst, its practical application in carbonylation reaction remains largely unexplored. Here we report our recent study on Fe&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is catalyzed by an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; complex. This low&#8208;valent iron species activates alkyl bromides via a distinctive two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, whereas it proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) process for alkyl iodides which is consistent with literature.

         <title>Modular Construction of a Tessellated Octahedron, its Hierarchical Spherical Aggregate Behavior, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a tessellated triangle T1 and the construction of a tessellated octahedron O1 containing metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels are demonstrated. O1 has a diameter on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and a molecular weight greater than 84&#8197;kDa. After hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has led to the formation of various aesthetical polyhedrons and compounds with advanced functions. Whereas two&#8208;dimensional supramolecules with complex and giant skeletons are plentiful, the constructions of polyhedrons are limited by using basic polygons as the panels. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tessellated triangle and tessellated octahedron with metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels and formed via template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These architectures have diameters on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and molecular weights greater than 84&#8197;kDa. Interestingly, fiber and spherical&#8208;like nanostructures could be formed from the tessellated triangles and octahedrons, respectively, through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. In addition, after hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.

         <title>Salt&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Reinforced Carbonate Electrolyte for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt strategy is proposed to boost LiNO3 solubility in carbonate electrolytes using multivalent salt carrier. The NO3&#8722;&#8208;containing anion complexes and multivalent cations as interphase adsorbing components promote the anion&#8208;derived SEI formation. The designed electrolyte presents a superior Li CE of 99.7&#8201;% and enables the NMC811 full cells with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The instability of carbonate electrolyte with metallic Li greatly limits its application in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Here, a &#8220;salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; strategy is applied to boost the LiNO3 solubility in the carbonate electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 carrier, which enables the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for excellent Li metal anode performance and also maintains the cathode stability. In the designed electrolyte, both NO3&#8722; and PF6&#8722; anions participate in the Li+&#8208;solvent complexes, thus promoting the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Our designed electrolyte has achieved a superior Li CE of 99.7&#8201;%, enabling the high&#8208;loading NCM811||Li (4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) full cell with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles. The enhancement of LiNO3 solubility by divalent salts is universal, which will also inspire the electrolyte design for other metal batteries.

         <title>Bis(imidazolium)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphosphete&#8208;diide: A Building Block for FeC2P2 Complexes and Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;diphosphete&#8208;diide, (IPr)2C2P2, acts as an electronically remarkably flexible ligand to iron carbonyl fragments, giving access to complexes of the general formula [Fe(CO)x{(IPr)2C2P2}]n+ (x=2, 3; n=0, +1, +2). Redox events involve either the metal ion or C2P2 ligand, as demonstrated by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer and computational analyses and characterize (IPr)2C2P2 as a redox active ligand.







Abstract
Reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic four&#8208;membered heterocycle (IPr)2C2P2 (1) (IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with [Fe2CO9] gives the neutral iron tricarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}] (2). Oxidation with two equivalents of the ferrocenium salt, [Fe(Cp)2](BArF24), affords the dicationic tricarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)3&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}](BArF24)2 (4). The one&#8208;electron oxidation proceeds under concomitant loss of one CO ligand to give the paramagnetic dicarbonyl radical cation complex [Fe(CO)2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}](BArF24) (5). Reduction of 5 allows the preparation of the neutral dicarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}] (6). An analysis by various spectroscopic techniques (57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, EPR) combined with DFT calculations gives insight into differences of the electronic structure within the members of this unique series of iron carbonyl complexes, which can be either described as electron precise or Wade&#8211;Mingos clusters.

         <title>Diterpene Biosynthesis from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogues with Changed Reactivities Expands Skeletal Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two analogues of geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bond were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases. The double bond shift causes a change of reactivity that results in the formation of many diterpenes with novel skeletons. A total number of 28 new diterpenes is reported and their mechanism of formation is discussed.







Abstract
Two analogues of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bonds, named iso&#8208;GGPP I and iso&#8208;GGPP II, were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases from bacteria, fungi and protists. The changed reactivity in the substrate analogues resulted in the formation of 28 new diterpenes, many of which exhibit novel skeletons.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;Oxyhalogenation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkynes via Directed Nucleopalladation: Catalytic Access to Tetrasubstituted Alkenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxyhalogenation of unactivated internal alkynes is facilitated by a structurally tuned bidentate directing auxiliary, providing rapid access to tetrasubstituted alkenes that can be further diversified into valuable products.







Abstract
A catalytic 1,2&#8208;oxyhalogenation method that converts non&#8208;conjugated internal alkynes into tetrasubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is described. Mechanistically, the reaction involves a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle that begins with a directed oxypalladation step. The origin of regioselectivity is the preference for formation of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate, which is facilitated by an N,N&#8208;bidentate 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isopropyl (PIP) amide directing group. Selectivity for C(alkenyl)&#8722;X versus &#8722;N (X=halide) reductive elimination from the PdIV center depends on the identity of the halide anion; bromide and iodide engage in C(alkenyl)&#8722;X formation, while intramolecular C(alkenyl)&#8722;N reductive elimination occurs with chloride to furnish a lactam product. DFT calculations shed light on the origins of this phenomenon.

Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was able to resolve the distribution of molecules in human pancreatic cancer cell membranes. TERS imaging revealed the arrangement of different cell membrane components with a spatial resolution down to 2.5&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Lack of appropriate tools for visualizing cell membrane molecules at the nanoscale in a non&#8208;invasive and label&#8208;free fashion limits our understanding of many vital cellular processes. Here, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the molecular distribution in pancreatic cancer cell (BxPC&#8208;3) membranes in ambient conditions without labelling, with a spatial resolution down to ca. 2.5&#8197;nm. TERS imaging reveals segregation of phenylalanine&#8208;, histidine&#8208;, phosphatidylcholine&#8208;, protein&#8208;, and cholesterol&#8208;rich BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane domains at the nm length&#8208;scale. TERS imaging also showed a cell membrane region where cholesterol is mixed with protein. Interestingly, the higher resolution TERS imaging revealed that the molecular domains observed on the BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane are not chemically &#8220;pure&#8221; but also contain other biomolecules. These results demonstrate the potential of TERS for non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free imaging of cell membranes with nanoscale resolution.

Radicals in carbon nitride are invoked as photocatalytically competent species. However, their structure and localisation is ill&#8208;defined. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of speciation, electronic structure, long&#8208;range distributions and photo&#8208;response of such radicals, as a function of carbon nitride morphology. This work paves the way to the engineering of the defective structure of carbon nitride and related 2D materials.







Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN) is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that combines good structural properties and a broad scope. The photocatalytic efficiency of CN is associated with the presence of defective and radical species. An accurate description of defective states&#8212;both at a local and extended level&#8212;is key to develop a thorough mechanistic understanding of the photophysics of CN. In turn, this will maximise the generation and usage of photogenerated charge carriers and minimise wasteful charge recombination. Here the influence of morphology and light&#8208;excitation on the number and chemical nature of radical defects is assessed. By exploiting the magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole coupling, the spatial distribution of native radicals in CN is derived with high precision. From the analysis an average distance in the range 1.99&#8211;2.34&#8197;nm is determined, which corresponds to pairs of radicals located approximately four tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units apart.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Assisted Reversible Migratory Coupling of Aminoborane at Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare case of dynamic migratory insertion of unsaturated species in normal valent s&#8208;block chemistry has been observed at magnesium bis(amidoboranes). The process is facilitated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, and is fundamentally a dynamic acid/base exchange between aminoborane (Me2N=BH2) and Lewis acidic magnesium species.







Abstract
A combined synthetic and theoretical investigation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of magnesium amidoboranes is presented, which involves a rare example of reversible migratory insertion within a normal valent s&#8208;block element. The reaction of (NHC)Mg(N(SiMe3)2)2 (1) and dimethylamine borane yields the tris(amide) adduct (NHC&#8722;BN)Mg(NMe2BH3)(N(SiMe3)2) (2; NHC&#8722;BN = NHC&#8722;BH2NMe2). In addition to Me2N=BH2 capture at the NHCC&#8722;Mg bond, mechanistic investigations suggest the likelihood of aminoborane migratory insertion from an RMg(NMe2BH2NMe2BH3) intermediate. To elucidate these processes, the carbene complexes (NHC)Mg(NMe2BH3)2 (8) and (NHC)Mg(NMe2BH2NMe2BH3)2 (9) were synthesized, and a dynamic migration of Me2N=BH2 between Mg&#8722;N and NHCC&#8722;Mg bonds was observed in 9. This unusual reversible migratory insertion is presumably induced by dissimilar charge localization in the &#8722;{NMe2BH2NMe2BH3} anion, as well as the capacity of NHCs to reversibly capture Me2N=BH2 in the presence of Lewis acidic magnesium species.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of Sulfonamides with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides/Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamidation of (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with excellent reaction scope by using oxalamides or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides as the ligands. For bromides, only 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% CuI and oxalamides were required. For chlorides, increasing catalytic loadings to 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu2O and ligands was needed. Direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs were achieved under these conditions.







Abstract
Direct N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides is a very attractive approach for preparing pharmaceutically important N&#8208;(hetero)aryl sulfonamides because it avoids the potential genotoxic problem resulting from the previous condensation method. Most known catalytic methods suffer from limited reaction scope and inconveniency on metal catalyst and ligand availability. Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper salts and oxalamides at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the catalysis of Cu2O and a 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.

         <title>An Anticancer Rhenium Tricarbonyl Targets Fe&#8722;S Cluster Biogenesis in Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomic approach to inorganic drug discovery improves the prioritization of candidate drug targets and revealed the scaffold protein NUBP2 involved in Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis as a relevant target for the rhenium tricarbonyl TRIP. This approach efficiently deconvolutes the polypharmacology of metal&#8208;based drug candidates and may be generally applied.







Abstract
Target identification remains a critical challenge in inorganic drug discovery to deconvolute potential polypharmacology. Herein, we describe an improved approach to prioritize candidate protein targets based on a combination of dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomics and treatment effects in living cancer cells for the rhenium tricarbonyl compound TRIP. Chemoproteomics revealed 89 distinct dose&#8208;dependent targets with concentrations of competitive saturation between 0.1 and 32&#8197;&#956;M despite the broad proteotoxic effects of TRIP. Target&#8208;response networks revealed two highly probable targets of which the Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis factor NUBP2 was competitively saturated by free TRIP at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, TRIP treatment led to a down&#8208;regulation of Fe&#8722;S cluster containing proteins and upregulated ferritin. Fe&#8722;S cluster depletion was further verified by assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Consequently, TRIP emerges as a first&#8208;in&#8208;class modulator of the scaffold protein NUBP2, which disturbs Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis at sub&#8208;cytotoxic concentrations in ovarian cancer cells.

         <title>A Deprotection&#8208;free Method for High&#8208;yield Synthesis of Graphdiyne Powder with In Situ Formed CuO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deprotection&#8208;free method was developed for the synthesis of GDY powder with 100&#8201;% yield. CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of &#8776;2.9&#8197;nm were in situ generated on GDY after the reaction. The as&#8208;prepared CuO/GDY was an excellent co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the start&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt cocatalyst. This work provides a straightforward deprotection&#8208;free approach, which will definitely expand the diverse applications of GDY.







Abstract
With a direct band gap, superior charge carrier mobility, and uniformly distributed pores, graphdiyne (GDY) has stimulated tremendous interest from the scientific community. However, its broad application is greatly limited by the complicated multistep synthesis process including complex deprotection of hexakis&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS) and peeling of GDY from the substrates. Here, we describe a deprotection&#8208;free strategy to prepare GDY powder by directly using HEB&#8208;TMS as the monomer. When CuCl was used as the catalysts in DMF solvent, the yield of GDY powder reached &#8776;100&#8201;%.

     alt="A Deprotection-free Method for High-yield Synthesis of Graphdiyne Powder with In Situ Formed CuO Nanoparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deprotection-free method was developed for the synthesis of GDY powder with 100&#8201;% yield. CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of &#8776;2.9&#8197;nm were in situ generated on GDY after the reaction. The as-prepared CuO/GDY was an excellent co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the start-of-art Pt cocatalyst. This work provides a straightforward deprotection-free approach, which will definitely expand the diverse applications of GDY.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a direct band gap, superior charge carrier mobility, and uniformly distributed pores, graphdiyne (GDY) has stimulated tremendous interest from the scientific community. However, its broad application is greatly limited by the complicated multistep synthesis process including complex deprotection of hexakis-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB-TMS) and peeling of GDY from the substrates. Here, we describe a deprotection-free strategy to prepare GDY powder by directly using HEB-TMS as the monomer. When CuCl was used as the catalysts in DMF solvent, the yield of GDY powder reached &#8776;100&#8201;%. More interestingly, uniformly dispersed CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of &#8776;2.9&#8197;nm were in situ formed on GDY after the reaction. The prepared CuO/GDY was demonstrated an excellent co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state-of-art Pt co-catalyst. The deprotection-free approach will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of a Proposed Terminal Iron(III) Nitride Intermediate of Nitrogen Fixation Stabilized by a Trisphosphine&#8208;Borane Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
The generation and low&#8208;temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl)borane), a plausible intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, is reported. EPR spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations define a 2A ground state electronic structure for this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride, placing an unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector.







Abstract
Terminal iron nitrides (Fe&#8801;N) have been proposed as intermediates of Fe&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, and well&#8208;defined synthetic iron nitrides have been characterized in high oxidation states, including FeIV, FeV, and FeVI. This study reports the generation and low temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl)borane), which is a proposed intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation by the P3BFe&#8208;catalyst system. CW&#8208; and pulse EPR spectroscopy (HYSCORE and ENDOR), supported by DFT calculations, help to define a 2A ground state electronic structure of this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride species, placing the unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector; this electronic structure is distinct for an iron nitride. The unusual d5&#8208;configuration is stabilized by significant delocalization (&#8776;50&#8201;%) of the unpaired electron onto the axial boron and nitrogen ligands, with a majority of the spin residing on boron.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Based Supramolecular Access to Full&#8208;Scale Phase&#8208;Diagram Structures through in situ Phase&#8208;Volume Ratio Phototuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy was demonstrated based on the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules (persulfurated arenes) and block polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions, leading to progressive and wide&#8208;ranging phase transitions across the phase diagram under different irradiation periods.







Abstract
Controlling phase separation and transition plays a core role in establishing and maintaining the function of diverse self&#8208;assembled systems. However, it remains challenging to achieve wide&#8208;range continuous phase transition for dynamically producing a variety of assembled structures. Here, we developed a far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium system, upon the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules and block copolymers, to establish an in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy. Thus, full&#8208;scale phase&#8208;diagram structures, from lamellar structure to gyroidal, cylindrical, and finally to a spherical one, can be accessed under different irradiation periods. Moreover, the phase transition was accompanied by considerable aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity change for building a functional surface. This strategy allows for a conceptual advance of accessing a wide range of distinct self&#8208;assembled structures and functions in real time.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Poly(Imine&#8208;Carbonate) Derived from Plastic Waste and Bio&#8208;based Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling of polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) with a bio&#8208;based vanillin derivative into novel dialdehyde monomer DVEC is shown. DVEC was further polymerized by using primary amines into high&#8208;performance poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s. These modular polymers are reprocessable and chemically recyclable under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions, thereby enabling a closed&#8208;loop recycling scheme.







Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers represents the key technology to convert plastic waste in a sustainable fashion. Efficient chemical recycling and upcycling strategies are thus highly sought&#8208;after to establish a circular plastic economy. Here, we present the selective chemical depolymerization of polycarbonate by employing a vanillin derivative as bio&#8208;based feedstock. The resulting di&#8208;vanillin carbonate monomer was used in combination with various amines to construct a library of reprocessable poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s, which show tailor&#8208;made thermal and mechanical properties. These novel poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s exhibit excellent recyclability under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions. This allows the recovery of monomers in high yields and purity for immediate reuse, even when mixed with various commodity plastics. This work provides exciting new insights in the design of bio&#8208;based circular polymers produced by upcycling of plastic waste with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>Ultrasmall Copper Nanoclusters in Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature synthetic strategy is reported for incorporation of ultrasmall Cu nanoclusters into a series of robust Zr&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The resultant core&#8211;shell composites mediate CO2 photoreduction selectively and outperform similar composites even with variable Cu spatial distribution.







Abstract
Encapsulating ultrasmall Cu nanoparticles inside Zr&#8208;MOFs to form core&#8211;shell architecture is very challenging but of interest for CO2 reduction. We report for the first time the incorporation of ultrasmall Cu NCs into a series of benchmark Zr&#8208;MOFs, without Cu NCs aggregation, via a scalable room temperature fabrication approach. The Cu NCs@MOFs core&#8211;shell composites show much enhanced reactivity in comparison to the Cu NCs confined in the pore of MOFs, regardless of their very similar intrinsic properties at the atomic level. Moreover, introducing polar groups on the MOF structure can further improve both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the CuI sites located at the interface between Cu NCs and support serve as the active sites and efficiently catalyze CO2 photoreduction. This synergetic effect may pave the way for the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient catalysts for CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;value chemical feedstock.

         <title>In Situ Imaging of Ion Motion in a Single Nanoparticle: Structural Transformations in Selenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle was achieved by dark&#8208;field microscopy and disclosed the transformation of amorphous SeNPs into polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2.







Abstract
Intraparticle ion motions are critical to the structure and properties of nanomaterials, but rarely disclosed. Herein, in situ visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle is presented by dark&#8208;field microscopy imaging, which shows HgCl2&#8208;induced structural transformation of amorphous selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with the main composition of Se8. Owing to the high binding affinity with selenium and coulomb interactions, Hg2+ ions can permeate into the interior of SeNPs, making the amorphous Se8 turn to polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2. As a proof of concept, SeNPs then serve as a highly effective scavenger for selective removal of Hg2+ ions from solution. This new finding offers visual proof for the photophysical process involving intraparticle ion motion, demonstrating that tracking the ion motions is a novel strategy to comprehend the formation mechanism with the purpose of developing new nanostructures like nanoalloys and nano metal compounds.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustaining Fluorination of Active Methylene Compounds and High&#8208;Yielding Fluorination of Highly Basic Aryl and Alkenyl Lithium Species with a Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Fluorosulfonamide Reagent</title>

By developing a sterically hindered fluorinating agent, N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved an unprecedented high&#8208;yield fluorination of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species.







Abstract
Fluorination of carbanions is pivotal for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds, but the current N&#8208;F fluorinating agents have significant drawbacks due to many reactive locations that surround the reactive N&#8722;F site. By developing a sterically hindered N&#8208;fluorosulfonamide reagent, namely N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved the high&#8208;yielding fluorination of the hitherto difficult highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species. In the former, the mild and high yield fluorination of active methylene compounds exhibited wide functional group tolerance and its novel catalytic fluorination&#8208;deprotonation cycle mechanism was demonstrated by deuterium&#8208;tracing experiments. In the latter, NFBB reacted with a variety of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species to provide the desired fluoro (hetero)arenes and alkenes in unprecedented high or quantitative yields.

         <title>Management of Donor and Acceptor Building Blocks in Dopant&#8208;Free Polymer Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer design strategy was proposed by managing the donor and acceptor building blocks with longitudinal extended conjugation for dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs). The optimized device based on the polymer HTM constructed by longitudinal extended BDT&#8208;T and BDD units shows a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.04&#8201;% and greatly improved operational stability.







Abstract
The dominant hole transport material (HTM) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which needs to be doped using hydrophilic dopants to improve its hole mobility and conductivity, resulting in inferior device stability. Here, we propose an effective molecular design strategy to construct dopant&#8208;free polymer HTMs by selecting four structurally related polymers and investigating their structure&#8211;property relationship. It is found that the donor and acceptor units with longitudinal conjugate extension, such as BDT&#8208;T and BDD, could not only enhance the planarity of the conjugated polymer backbone and tune the energy levels but also promote the face&#8208;on orientation, resulting in superior charge extraction and transport. The optimized device utilizing dopant&#8208;free polymer HTM shows a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V and a champion efficiency of 24.04&#8201;% with greatly improved operational stability, making it among the best performance PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [2+1] and [4+1] Annulations of Diynes with Ketones via Carbonyl Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal [2+1] and [4+1] annulation of diynes with ketones via carbonyl ylides is disclosed. This protocol enables the divergent, practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of chiral oxiranes and dihydrofurans in moderate to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Carbonyl ylides have proven to be powerful synthons for the efficient construction of various valuable O&#8208;heterocycles, and the formation of carbonyl ylides by the reaction of metal carbenes with carbonyls has attracted increasing attention over the past decades. However, a catalyst&#8208;controlled highly enantioselective reaction of carbonyl ylides from metal carbenes is extremely challenging. Herein, we report a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal [2+1] and [4+1] annulations of diynes with ketones via carbonyl ylides. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first example of successful asymmetric epoxidation via carbonyl ylides, but also constitutes the first reaction of vinyl cations with carbonyl compounds. This method leads to the divergent, practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of chiral oxiranes and dihydrofurans in moderate to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via remote&#8208;stereocontrol strategy.

         <title>Enantioselective Biocascade Catalysis with a Single Multifunctional Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multifunctional enzyme is reported that can promote biocatalytic cascades based on multiple stereoselective steps. Specifically, a 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme can form enamine and iminium ion intermediates from aldehydes and enals to promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamines and iminium ions and combine their mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes. The multifunctional 4&#8208;OT enzymes could promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Polymers via Coordination Post&#8208;Assembly</title>

A type of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers was prepared using soluble and well&#8208;defined MOPs as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks. The introduction of MOPs constructs a coordination dynamic network that not only enhances mechanical properties but also realizes multifunctionality including self&#8208;healing, shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. CHMOPs provide a novel platform for expansion of the smart soft materials.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks with reversible and dynamic characteristics are gaining increasing interest in diverse application fields. Herein, we use a coordination crosslinking approach using metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks to post&#8208;assemble a class of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers. The introduction of 12&#8208;connected MOP nodes to the polymeric networks is critical to producing membranes that overcome the trade&#8208;off between mechanical properties and dynamic healing, and meanwhile possess multifunctionalities including shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. The CHMOPs can also be used for anticorrosion coating and achieve function couplings, e.g., shape memory&#8208;assisted self&#8208;healing (SMASH), which have not been achieved in the MOP&#8208;based hybrid materials yet. This work not only offers a feasible strategy to construct new multifunctional materials but also greatly expands the application scopes of MOPs.

Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanosheets (NSs) of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni have been produced by the post&#8208;modification of robust guanine&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;linked metal&#8208;free 2,2&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;containing HOF&#8208;25 followed by exfoliation.

Abstract
Post&#8208;modification of robust guanine&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;linked 2,2&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;containing HOF&#8208;25 with Ni(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O followed by exfoliation using sonication method affords hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanosheets (NSs) of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni in the yield of 56&#8201;%. TEM and AFM technologies disclose the ultrathin nature of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni NSs with thickness of 4.4&#8197;nm. STM observation determines the presence of sql segments assembled from HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni building blocks at the heptanoic acid/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite interface, supporting the simulated 2D supramolecular framework. ICP&#8208;MS, XAS, and XPS data prove the successful immobilization of atomic nickel sites on the 20&#8201;% total 2,2&#8242;&#8208;pyridine moieties in crystalline HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni. With the aid of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and triisopropanolamine, 10&#8197;wt% HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni NSs dispersed on graphene oxide efficiently promotes visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction, showing a 96.3&#8201;% CO selectivity with a prominent conversion rate up to 24&#8201;323&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Robust and Dynamic Polymer Networks Enabled by Woven Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Woven nodes, serving as dynamic crosslinks, afford a woven polymer network (WPN). The WPN exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue properties to those of covalent polymer networks (CPN), but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity, self&#8208;healing, and reprocessability, resembling those of supramolecular polymer networks (SPN).







Abstract
Crosslinking plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties of polymer materials. Although various crosslinks based on covalent or noncovalent bonds have been adopted, it remains an enormous challenge to develop a crosslink which could endow corresponding polymer network with robust yet dynamic properties. Herein, we report a crosslink simultaneously having dynamic property and woven geometry, and the polymer network with woven crosslinks (WPN) could integrate the merits of covalent polymer network (CPN) and supramolecular polymer network (SPN). In specific, the WPN not only exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of CPN, but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity and ductility, similar to those of SPN. Particularly, its toughness and puncture resistance are much superior to those of the others. Besides, the dynamicity of woven crosslink also imparts good performances of self&#8208;healing and processability to WPN.

A dinuclear parent hafnium imido complex prepared by reduction of the bisazide precursor, afforded a terminally bonded parent imide. DFT calculations revealed: Formation of parent imide proceeds via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido unit with a computed pKBH+ of ca. &#8764;57, followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of nearby benzyl group across the anionic Hf&#8801;N bond. Reactivity studies of the anionic HfNH moiety are also presented.







Abstract
A dinuclear hafnium complex containing the parent imido ligand [(PN)(PNC)Hf=NH{&#956;2&#8208;K}]2 (2) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2; PNC2&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;CH2Me2C6H2), was prepared by reduction of the bisazide trans&#8208;[(PN)2Hf(N3)2] (1) with two equiv of KC8. Encapsulation of K+ in 2 with crown&#8208;ether or cryptand affords the first discrete salt [K(encap)][(PN)(PNC)Hf&#8801;NH] (encap=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6(THF)2, 3; 2,2,2&#8208;Kryptofix, 4), featuring a terminal parent imide and possessing some of the shortest Hf&#8722;N bond lengths known to date. DFT calculations revealed formation of 2 to proceed via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido, [(PN)2Hf&#8801;N]&#8722;(A), having a computed pKBH+ of &#8764;57 followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of a benzylic methyl group across the Hf&#8801;N triple bond in A. An electronic structure analysis reveals A to possess a covalent Hf&#8801;N triple bond and of super&#8208;basic character. We also showcase reactivity of the Hf&#8801;NH bond with various electrophiles.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Edge Functionalized Top&#8208;Down Chiral Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral and fluorescent supramolecular assemblies of graphene quantum dots were built by means of amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The structural features of the resultant materials were studied by a range of analytical and spectroscopic techniques, namely FTIR, XPS, absorption and emission spectroscopy and TGA.







Abstract
The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interactions of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.

         <title>Insight into the Overlooked Photochemical Decomposition of Atmospheric Surface Nitrates Triggered by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light photocatalysis contributes significantly to the decomposition of surface nitrates. Monodentate nitrate (m&#8208;NO3&#8722;) can be gradually decomposed to NOx by photogenerated electrons starting from the weakly coordinated N&#8722;O bond. The presence of water vapor promotes the generation of gas&#8208;phase products because more stable bidentate nitrate (b&#8208;NO3&#8722;) will be converted into m&#8208;NO3&#8722; by the abundant surface hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides (NOx) formed by photochemical reaction of surface nitrates raise significant concerns. However, little is known about the effect of visible light (&gt;380&#8197;nm) on nitrate decomposition and the reaction mechanism. Herein, the decomposition of surface nitrates is investigated under visible light. The results indicate that visible light photocatalysis contributes significantly to nitrate decomposition. Monodentate nitrate (m&#8208;NO3&#8722;) can be decomposed into NOx by photogenerated electrons starting from the weakly coordinated N&#8722;O bond. Water vapor promotes NOx generation because more stable bidentate nitrate (b&#8208;NO3&#8722;) will be converted into m&#8208;NO3&#8722; by surface hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding interactions. Alternatively, b&#8208;NO3&#8722; can be directly decomposed to NO2&#8722; by NO attack, but this process is subject to photocatalytic oxidation. This work brings a new focus on the atmospheric NOx sources and provides a more nuanced understanding of nitrates decomposition processes.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Doping Effect on Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Ligated Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of single and multiple gold atom doping on optical properties of silver nanoclusters was analysed in linear and nonlinear regime experimentally and with TD&#8208;DFT simulations. Ag24Au1 nanocluster is a robust emitter, with strongly enhanced luminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness with respect to Ag25 parent nanocluster.







Abstract
Noble metal nanoclusters allow for the atomically&#8208;precise control of their composition. However, to create nanoclusters with pre&#8208;defined optical properties, comprehensive description of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the gold atom doping impact on one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) and luminescence properties of ligated silver nanoclusters via combined experimental studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations (TD&#8208;DFT). We synthesized a series of Ag25&#8722;xAux(DMBT)18 nanoclusters where x=0, 1 and 5&#8211;10. For Ag24Au1(DMBT)18 we demonstrate that the presence of the central Au dopant strongly influences linear and non&#8208;linear optical properties, increasing photoluminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness, with respect to undoped silver nanoclusters. With improved TPA and luminescence, atomically&#8208;precise AuAg alloys presented in our work can serve as robust luminescent probes e.g. for bioimaging in the second biological window.

         <title>Hybrid Germanium Bromide Perovskites with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of non&#8208;centrosymmetric hybrid Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites are reported, showing second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. The largest SHG signal from CH3NH3GeBr3 is likely due to the perferable alignment of the polar cation with the lone pair electrons of Ge2+ along the [111] direction.







Abstract
Ge&#8208;based hybrid perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for second harmonic generation (SHG) due to the geometry and lone&#8208;pair induced non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Here, we report a new family of hybrid 3D Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites AGeBr3, A=CH3NH3 (MA), CH(NH2)2 (FA), Cs and FAGe0.5Sn0.5Br3, crystallizing in polar space groups. These compounds exhibit tunable SHG responses, where MAGeBr3 shows the strongest SHG intensity (5&#215;potassium dihydrogen phosphate, KDP). Structural and theoretical analysis indicate the high SHG efficiency is attributed to the displacement of Ge2+ along [111] direction and the relatively strong interactions between lone pair electrons of Ge2+ and polar MA cations along the c&#8208;axis. This work provides new structural insights for designing and fine&#8208;tuning the SHG properties in hybrid metal halide materials.

         <title>Extended Conjugation Tuning Carbon Nitride for Non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 Photosynthesis and Hypoxic Tumor Therapy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers downshifted the band position in a new carbon nitride that promoted water oxidation kinetics while avoiding thermodynamic photoreduction of H2. The material showed competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% for overall H2O2 production under normoxic conditions and record high activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1) for high&#8208;performance hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Artificial photocatalysis offers a clean approach for producing H2O2. However, the poor selectivity and activity of H2O2 production hamper traditional industrial applications and emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we report a C5N2 photocatalyst with a conjugated C=N linkage for selective and efficient non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 production in both normoxic and hypoxic systems. The strengthened delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers in C5N2 downshifted the band position, thermodynamically eliminating side H2 evolution reaction and kinetically promoting water oxidation. As a result, C5N2 had a competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% in overall H2O2 production and exhibited by far the highest activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1). C5N2 was further applied to hypoxic PDT/CDT with outstanding performance in apparent cancer cell death and synchronous bioimaging. The study sheds light on the photosynthesis of H2O2 by carbon nitrides for health applications.

         <title>Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids and sulfinates provides a direct and modular access to sulfoxides by a photocatalytic process that has unveiled the unexplored chemoselective radicalophilic reactivity of intermediate sulfinyl sulfones and enabled the conjunctive coupling of two carboxylic acids, revealing broad new chemical space accessible by the merger of the two coupling partner classes of emergent synthetic importance.







Abstract
The intermediate oxidation state of sulfoxides is central to the plethora of their applications in chemistry and medicine, yet it presents challenges for an efficient synthetic access, limiting the structural diversity of currently available sulfoxides. Here, we report a data&#8208;guided development of direct decarboxylative sulfinylation that enables the previously inaccessible functional group interconversion of carboxylic acids to sulfoxides in a reaction with sulfinates. Given the broad availability of carboxylic acids and the growing synthetic potential of sulfinates, the direct decarboxylative sulfinylation is poised to improve the structural diversity of synthetically accessible sulfoxides. The reaction is facilitated by a kinetically favored sulfoxide formation from the intermediate sulfinyl sulfones, despite the strong thermodynamic preference for the sulfone formation, unveiling the previously unknown and chemoselective radicalophilic sulfinyl sulfone reactivity.

         <title>Cover Picture: Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 43/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative sulfinylation is reported by Oleg&#8197;V. Larionov and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210525), as illustrated in the cover picture. The reaction is enabled by radicalophilic reactivity of the sulfinyl sulfones shown in the top left that is distinct from the known dissociation and nucleophilic substitution pathways. Given the importance of carboxylic acids and sulfoxides for medicinal chemistry, agroscience, and organic synthesis, decarboxylative sulfination addresses the unmet need for a direct interconversion between the two functional groups and provides access to new sulfoxide chemical space.

An ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with a suitable pore environment and electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to C2H2 is reported by Zhangjing Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202207579). The framework shows extra strong affinity to C2H2 and the highest IAST selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation among the adsorbents reported.

A deprotection&#8208;free method was developed for the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY) powder with in&#8208;situ formed CuO nanoparticles, as reported by Mohamed Nawfal Ghazzal, Li&#8208;Zhu Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202210242). The prepared CuO/GDY was demonstrated to be an excellent co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt cocatalyst. The work will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.

         <title>Sorbents for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: From Design Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) holds great promise in offering decentralized solutions for broad access to safe drinking water. This Review systematically discusses the moisture extraction mechanisms and related design rules of various sorbent materials. Device engineering and multifunctional applications are also discussed to present a comprehensive picture of sorbent&#8208;based AWH.







Abstract
Water scarcity caused by climate change and population growth poses a grave threat to human society. Of the different water purification technologies put forward, one presents a promising strategy that is spatially or temporally non&#8208;restricted&#8212;atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Here we review recent progress in the design and study of AWH sorbents, ranging from the innovative chemistries to the integration of sophisticated architectures and functional components, and clarify the structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship that governs the water capture and release processes. Features and limitations of each type of sorbents are summarized to elucidate the optimal working environments and modes. Progress in applications extending from water generation to thermal management and agriculture are discussed. Future developments regarding material modifications, performance measurements, and system optimizations are provided to overcome lingering barriers to sorbent design and implementation.

         <title>Schiff Base Mediated Dipeptide Assembly toward Nanoarchitectonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes recent strategies that exploit dynamic Schiff base reactions in combination with supramolecular chemistry to mediate dipeptide assembly toward the formation of nanoarchitectonics. These strategies generate dipeptide assembled systems with diverse structures and new emergent properties, including bioactivity as well as optoelectronic and mechanical functions, making these systems suitable for applications ranging from drug delivery and waveguiding to biocatalysis.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is fascinating because of its dual nature. It perfectly combines the reversible nature of noncovalent bonds with the robustness of covalent bonds, effectively enhancing the stability of assemblies and meanwhile giving rise to unprecedented properties. Therefore, integration of DCC with supramolecular chemistry has emerged as a versatile and an extraordinarily useful approach in directing peptide assembly. This Minireview focuses on a recent strategy, which exploits dynamic Schiff base chemistry in combination with supramolecular chemistry, to mediate dipeptide assembly toward nanoarchitectonics. Diversified structures, new emergent properties, and their related applications are highlighted. Lastly, the opportunities and prospects in this exciting field are also introduced.

         <title>Chiral Nanozymes for Enantioselective Biological Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are defined as nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. This Minireview provides an overview of recent developments in chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis, with an outlook on the opportunities and trends in this research area.







Abstract
As a neat combination of the characteristics of enzymatic activity and nanomaterials, nanozymes have attracted much attention. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, substrate selectivity is often overlooked in the construction of nanozymes. With their subtly evolving structures, natural enzymes generally possess high selectivity for chiral substrates which play important roles in biosynthesis and biomedical applications. However, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of recent advances in strategies for the synthesis of chiral nanozymes and their enantioselective biological catalysis. We further focus on current challenges, potential solutions, and future developing trends of chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis. There is plenty of room to explore. This Minireview will provide new insights into the development of chiral nanozymes and their applications.

         <title>Catalytic Applications of Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Oxide Nanomaterials</title>

Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise of being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials with a small environmental footprint. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years, more complex oxides have emerged. This Review discusses different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials having a small environmental footprint and excellent performance, albeit inferior to that of noble metal counterparts. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years more complex oxides and added functionality have emerged with enhanced performance. We will discuss different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis. We pay special attention to discriminate between the role of free versus that of bound charges within the catalyst, which is crucial to disentangle the different contributions to the catalytic reaction for the benefit of the overall enhanced catalytic performance in e.g. wastewater treatment and ultimately water&#8208;splitting.

         <title>Unusual Quartet&#8208;Doublet Phosphorescence from the Phosphaethynyl Radical, CP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CP is generated by photolysis of phosphaethyne (HCP) isolated in solid argon. Phosphorescence of the radical, observed after the B2&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ photoexcitation, is assisted by an intersystem crossing from B2&#931;+ to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Intense, well&#8208;resolved vibronic progressions were traced for a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#928;i emission systems. Phosphorescence lifetime is on the order of 0.1&#8197;s.







Abstract
We report the first detection of phosphorescence from the phosphaethynyl radical. This rare instance of quartet&#8208;doublet emission, studied here in solid argon, is presumably promoted by efficient intersystem crossing from the originally photoexcited doublet (B2&#931;+) to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Vibronic progressions were traced for the a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#1055;i systems from their origins up to (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=5) and (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=2) bands, respectively. The measured phosphorescence lifetime is 108 &#177; 3&#8197;ms.

         <title>An Ultramicroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Exhibiting High C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a suitable pore environment and complementary electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to acetylene (C2H2) molecule, the ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 exhibits extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is not only industrially important for acetylene purification but also great scientific challenge due to their very similar molecular size and physical properties. To address this difficulty, herein, we present an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) from tetracyano bicarbazole to separate C2H2 from CO2 by taking advantage of differences in their electrostatic potential distribution. This material possesses a suitable pore environment and electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to C2H2, thus showing extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation among the adsorbents reported. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the suitable pore environment in HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonded interactions N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C with C2H2 molecules. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its outstanding separation performance to C2H2/CO2 mixtures.

         <title>Direct Acquisition of the Gap Height of Biological Tissue&#8208;Electronic Chemical Sensor Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>

A pair of nanopores was integrated at the electrochemical sensor plane and used to measure the ion conductance between them providing a versatile strategy to directly determine the gap height during exocytotic release from tissues. Direct cooperative measurement of the gap height and exocytotic release at the same sensor can be used to address the long&#8208;term question of the influence of diffusional filtering on the exocytotic spike.







Abstract
Interfacing biological tissues with electronic sensors offers the exciting opportunity to accurately investigate multiple biological processes. Accurate signal collection and application are the foundation of these measurements, but a long&#8208;term issue is the signal distortion resulting from the interface gap. The height of the gap is the key characteristic needed to evaluate or model the distortion, but it is difficult to measure. By integrating a pair of nanopores at the electronic sensor plane and measuring the ion conductance between them, we developed a versatile and straightforward strategy to realize the direct cooperative evaluation of the gap height during exocytotic release from adrenal gland tissues. The signaling distortion of this gap has been theoretically evaluated and shows almost no influence on the amperometric recording of exocytosis in a classic &#8220;semi&#8208;artificial synapse&#8221; configuration. This strategy should benefit research concerning various bio/chemical/machine interfaces.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Recognition of Dicyanoaurate(I) by a Bambusuril Macrocycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bambusuril macrocycle is utilized for selective stripping of [Au(CN)2]&#8722; anion from activated carbon&#8212;a process relevant to industrial gold production. The efficient stripping is due to the complex of the macrocycle and [Au(CN)2]&#8722; formed at micromolar concentration in aqueous media.







Abstract
Dicyanoaurate(I) anion, [Au(CN)2]&#8722;, plays a central role in the current industrial production of gold, as its extraction from crude ore samples represents the most money&#8208;consuming step. Herein, we present the strongest host&#8211;guest recognition of dicyanoaurate anion using the bambusuril receptor in water, a highly competitive solvent. The micromolar stability of such a complex facilitated the up to date most efficient supramolecular stripping of dicyanoaurate from activated carbon at ambient temperature. Thermodynamic characteristics of bambusuril binding with [Au(CN)2]&#8722; differing from binding of other inorganic chaotropic anions are rationalized, as well as the bambusuril selectivity for [Au(CN)2]&#8722; over [Ag(CN)2]&#8722;.

         <title>Improving the Accuracy of Modelling CO2 Electroreduction on Copper Using Many&#8208;Body Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body perturbation theory within its random phase approximation is used to investigate the mechanism of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction on the Cu(100) facet, with special focus on the C&#8722;C coupling step. The formation of *OCCHO is proposed as the potential determining step, yielding onset potential and pH dependence matching well with experiments. RPA results also suggest that defective and stepped surfaces may be essential to understand the observed activity of Cu electrocatalysts for C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) remains the most important metal catalyst for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) into C2 products. Due to limited evidence from in situ experiments, mechanistic studies are often performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT), using functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level, which have fundamental difficulties to correctly describe CO adsorption and surface stability. We employ the adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem within the random phase approximation (RPA), in combination with the linearized Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation to describe solvation effects, to investigate the mechanism of CO2RR on the Cu(100) facet. Qualitatively different from the DFT&#8208;GGA results, RPA results propose the formation of *OCCHO as the potential determining step towards C2 products. The results suggest that it is important to use more accurate methods like RPA when modeling reactions involving multiple CO&#8208;related species like CO2RR.

         <title>Mild and Chemoselective Carboxylic Acid Reduction Promoted by Borane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, chemoselective method for the reduction of carboxylic acids, in the presence of both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic functional groups is reported. Experiments and DFT calculations point to a mechanism driven by hidden borane catalysis.







Abstract
Although considerable advances have been made in developing chemoselective transformations of ubiquitous carboxylic acid groups, many challenges still exist. For instance, their selective reduction is problematic if both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic groups are present in the starting material. Here, we address this problem with a simple and mild protocol using bench&#8208;stable reagents at ambient temperatures. This platform is able to tolerate a diverse range of functionality, leaving ketones, esters, nitro&#8208;groups, olefins, nitriles and amides untouched. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic experiments demonstrate that this reaction proceeds via hidden borane catalysis with small quantities of in situ generated BH3 playing a key role in the exquisite selectivity that is observed.

         <title>Introducing the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand into Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluorinated Cp* analogue [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; resisted all coordination attempts for more than 40&#8197;years. Now its first transition metal complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] is reported. The exceptionally weak binding character of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is proved by DFT calculations and substitution reactions with arenes, allowing to switch between ligand and weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
The reaction of AgBF4 and [Rh(COD)Cl]2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the fluorocarbon soluble complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] by salt metathesis. This complex represents the first example for a successful coordination of the weakly basic [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand, since its first synthesis in 1980. In addition to [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] also the byproduct [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)4H)] was isolated and fully characterized. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the interaction energy of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand towards the 12&#8208;electron fragment [Rh(COD)]+ is &#8776;70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in comparison to [C5(CH3)5]&#8722; due to reduced electrostatic interactions and weaker &#960;&#8208;donor properties of the ligand. The quantitative but reversible substitution of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand by toluene, converting it into a weakly coordinating anion, experimentally proved the extraordinary weak bonding interaction.

         <title>Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos: Highly Advantageous Properties as Molecular Photoswitches
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole, pyrrole, or indole substitution of heterocyclic hemithioindigo chromophores can deliver advanced photoswitching properties: combining full visible light responsiveness, high overall absorptions, pronounced absorption changes, up to quantitative isomer interconversions in both directions, tunable thermal isomerization speeds, and very high quantum yields. Precise geometry changes can be controlled by balancing isomer&#8208;specific chalcogen and hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
A survey of heterocyclic hemithioindigo photoswitches is presented identifying a number of structural motives with outstanding property profiles. The highly sought&#8208;after combination of pronounced color change, quantitative switching in both directions, exceptional high quantum yields, and tunable high thermal stability of metastable states can be realized with 4&#8208;imidazole, 2&#8208;pyrrole, and 3&#8208;indole&#8208;based derivatives. In the former, an unusual preorganization using isomer selective chalcogen&#8208; and hydrogen bonding allows to precisely control geometry changes and tautomerism upon switching. Heterocyclic hemithioindigos thus represent highly promising photoswitches with advanced capabilities that will be of great value to anyone interested in establishing defined and reversible control at the molecular level.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Analysis of Anionic Coordination Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>

Negative&#8208;ion mode ESI mass spectrometry permits the direct observation of anionic polymers resulting from the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with CoCl2 and organolithium reagents.







Abstract
Anionic coordination polymerizations proceed via highly reactive intermediates, whose in situ analysis has remained difficult. Here, we show that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is a promising method to obtain detailed information on the polymerization process. Focusing on polymerization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes initiated by CoCl2/RLi (R=Me, nBu, tBu, Ph), we directly observe the growing polymer chains and characterize the active anionic cobalt centers by gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments. On the basis of these results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the ESI mass spectra permit the determination of molecular weight distributions, which are in good agreement with those derived from NMR&#8208;spectroscopic as well as MALDI mass&#8208;spectrometric measurements, and afford a wealth of kinetic data.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible and fast vapor&#8208;triggered mechanical response of an actuating composite film based on crystalline organic cages is reported.







Abstract
The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (Oba&#8208;cage) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Super Light&#8208;Sensitive Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Improved Photodynamic Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super light&#8208;sensitive photosensitizer nanoparticles are fabricated by the self&#8208;assembly of Rose Bengal and hemoglobin conjugates. The nanoparticles can increase the production of singlet oxygen upon irradiation with an exceptional ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). They can be easily internalized by cancers in deep tissues and exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective method for superficial cancer treatment. However, the limited light intensity in tissues, tumor hypoxia, and the low accumulation efficiency of photosensitizers (PSs) in tumors are still major challenges. Herein, we introduce super light&#8208;sensitive PS nanoparticles (designated HR NPs) that can increase singlet oxygen (1O2) production and improve PS accumulation in tumors. HR NPs have the ability to produce a large amount of 1O2 under ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) irradiation. More significantly, HR NPs have a long circulating time in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and can accumulate in tumors with high efficiency. When irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength, the nanoparticles exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy. This work will make it possible to cure solid tumors by PDT by enhancing the therapeutic effects.

         <title>A Thioether&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Allyl Halides and Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling of allyl bromides and arylboronic acids was developed using a designer thioether catalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of a key sulfoxonium ylide that binds to the arylboronic acid and triggers 1,2&#8208;aryl migration.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions are an indispensable tool for organic synthesis. In these reactions transition metals have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Herein, we report our recent discovery of a designer thioether as a highly active organocatalyst for reactions between an allyl bromide and an arylboronic acid.

     alt="A Thioether-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reaction of Allyl Halides and Arylboronic Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organocatalytic cross-coupling of allyl bromides and arylboronic acids was developed using a designer thioether catalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of a key sulfoxonium ylide that binds to the arylboronic acid and triggers 1,2-aryl migration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling reactions are an indispensable tool for organic synthesis. In these reactions transition metals have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon-carbon bonds. Herein, we report our recent discovery of a designer thioether as a highly active organocatalyst for reactions between an allyl bromide and an arylboronic acid. The cross-coupling event occurred readily under mild condition in the presence of a weak inorganic base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested a sulfonium ylide mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Self&#8208;folding of Helical Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives in the Solid State Leading to Amplified Circular Dichroism and Circularly Polarized Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>

Optically active poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives self&#8208;fold in the solid state into a non&#8208;uniform structure with sharp turns connecting stretched segments where the turns exhibit remarkable optical anisotropy in the ground state and in excited states.







Abstract
An unprecedented non&#8208;uniform self&#8208;folding of artificial polymer chains composed of turn moieties and stretched segments is presented through the design of a set of optically active poly(fluorene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) (poly(fluorenevinylene)) derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group attached at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene backbone at various ratios. The folded structure is formed and stabilized through inter&#8208;chain interactions in the solid state, leading to remarkably enhanced chiroptical properties (chirality amplification) in terms of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized light (CPL) emission. This phenomenon is rationalized by experimental and theoretical CD and CPL spectral analyses. The polymer arrangements in the solid state were further assessed through transmission electron microscopic observations combined with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations in the solid state revealing the thin film organizations.

         <title>Biocompatible and Selective Generation of Bicyclic Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic peptides are increasingly popular in drug discovery; however, only few strategies for their synthesis exist. Dicyanopyridine&#8208;featured amino acids provide a biocompatible, selective, and catalyst&#8208;free pathway to access bicyclic peptides, which are characterized by superior preorganization and high target affinity.







Abstract
Bicyclic peptides possess superior properties for drug discovery; however, their chemical synthesis is not straightforward and often neither biocompatible nor fully orthogonal to all canonical amino acids. The selective reaction between 1,2&#8208;aminothiols and 2,6&#8208;dicyanopyridine allows direct access to complex bicyclic peptides in high yield. The process can be fully automated using standard solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Bicyclization occurs in water at physiological pH within minutes and without the need for a catalyst. The use of various linkers allows tailored bicyclic peptides with qualities such as plasma stability, conformational preorganization, and high target affinity. We demonstrate this for a bicyclic inhibitor of the Zika virus protease NS2B&#8208;NS3 as well as for bicyclic versions of the &#945;&#8208;helical antimicrobial peptide aurein 1.2.

         <title>Synthesis of a Hexachloro Sulfate(IV) Dianion Enabled by Polychloride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first preparation and structural characterization of the hexachlorosulfate dianion, [NEt3Me]2[SCl6], is achieved. This synthesis is enabled by the Janus&#8208;faced trichloride reagent [NEt3Me][Cl3]. While the trichloride [Cl3]&#8722; is chlorinating and oxidizing elemental sulfur, the unique [NEt3Me]+ cation is stabilizing the unprecedented [SCl6]2&#8722; dianion.







Abstract
The preparation and structural characterization of [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] is described, which is the first example of a [SCl6]2&#8722; dianion and of a halosulfate anion of the type [SxXy]z&#8722; in general. This dianion belongs to the group of 14&#8208;valence electron AB6E systems and forms an octahedral structure in the solid&#8208;state. Interestingly, co&#8208;crystallization with CH2Cl2 affords [NEt3Me]2[SCl6]&#8901;4&#8201;CH2Cl2 containing [SCl6]2&#8722; dianions with C4v symmetry. As suggested by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the distortion of the structure is not caused by a stereochemically active lone pair but by enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions with CH2Cl2. At elevated temperatures, [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] decomposes to various sulfur chlorine compounds as shown by Raman spectroscopy. Cooling back to room temperature results in the selective formation of [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] which is comparable to the well&#8208;studied SCl4.
