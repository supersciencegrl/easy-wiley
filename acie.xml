         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Antisite Defect and Coupling Anionic Redox in High&#8208;Voltage Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2, x&#8201;&#8805;&#8239;0.9) can significantly enhance the energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of Li&#8208;ion batteries beyond current levels. However, severe Li&#8208;Ni antisite defects and their undetermined dynamic evolutions during high&#8208;voltage cycling limit the further development of these ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. In this study, we quantify the dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8208;Ni antisite defect using operando neutron diffraction and reveal its coupling relationship with anionic redox, another critical challenge restricting ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. We detect a clear Ni migration coupled with an unstable oxygen lattice, which accompanies the oxidation of oxygen anions at high voltages. Based on these findings, we propose that minimized Li&#8208;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations are essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage cycling structures in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. This is further demonstrated by the optimized ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, where reduced dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8208;Ni antisite defect effectively inhibit the anionic redox, enhancing the 4.5 V cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Material with Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Efficient Organic Afterglow Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials capable of combining various emission behaviors for diversified optoelectronic properties and applications have recently gained a vigorous development, but it remains a forbidden challenge in designing OURTP molecules with hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, possibly due to the elevated difficulties in simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of both HLCT and OURTP emitters. Here, through introducing multiple heteroatoms into one&#8208;dimensional fused ring of coumarin with moderate charge transfer perturbation in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor architecture, we demonstrate a HLCT&#8208;featured OURTP molecule showing both promoted fluorescence with a quantum yield of 77% in solution and long&#8208;lived OURTP with a lifetime of 251 ms in conventional host material used in electroluminescent device. Thus, efficient OURTP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated, exhibiting bright electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 85% and yellow OURTP lasting over 2 s for afterglow. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP&#8208;OLEDs can be further optimized to reach an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~12% and OURTP EQE up to 3.11%, representing the highest performance among the reported OURTP&#8208;OLEDs. These impressive results highlight the significance to fuse HLCT and OURTP together in enriching OURTP materials and improving the afterglow OLED performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Geometric Chirality in Nanocrystals for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing catalyst design is pivotal for the enhancement of photocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion. The incorporation of structural chirality into conventional inorganic solar hydrogen nanocatalysts promises a significant transformation in catalysis, a feature absent in this field. Here we unveil the unexplored potential of geometric chirality by creating a chiral composite that integrates geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) with two&#8208;dimensional C3N4 nanosheets, significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond the achiral counterparts. The superior performance is driven by the geometric chirality of Au NPs, which facilitates efficient charge carrier separation through the favorable C3N4&#8208;chiral Au NP interface and chiral induced spin polarization, and exploits high&#8208;activity facets within the concave surfaces of chiral Au NPs. The resulting synergistic effect leads to a remarkable increase in photocatalytic H2 evolution, with an apparent quantum yield of 44.64% at 400 nm. Furthermore, we explore the selective polarized photo&#8208;induced carrier separation behavior, revealing a distinct chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic HER performance. Our work advances the design and utilization of chiral inorganic nanostructures for superior performance in energy conversion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme&#8217;s iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non&#8208;local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Preformation of Insoluble Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Highly Reversible Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for cycling reversibility of Na&#8208;ion batteries by mitigating continuous side reactions. So far, the severe SEI dissolution leads to low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and short cycle life. Meanwhile, the quantified relationship between SEI components and their solubility remains unclear. In this work, we establish the direct correlation between SEI components and SEI solubility, and quantify that the solubility of organic&#8208;rich SEI is 3.26 times of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. We further propose a feasible strategy to preform inorganic&#8208;rich insoluble SEI and demonstrate a practical hard carbon (HC)||NaMn0.33Fe0.33Ni0.33O2 full cell in commercial electrolyte of 1 M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 80.0% capacity retention for 900 cycles, and achieve a record&#8208;high average CE of 99.95% for a practical Na&#8208;ion full cell. This study provides an effective strategy of preforming insoluble SEI to suppress its dissolution towards highly reversible Na&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Using In&#8208;situ Transmission Electron Microscopy to Study Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely controlling the microstructure of supported metal catalysts and regulating metal&#8208;support interactions at the atomic level are essential for achieving highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) not only stabilizes metal nanoparticles and improves their resistance to sintering but also modulates the electrical interaction between metal species and the support, optimizing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, understating the formation mechanism of SMSI and its dynamic evolution during the chemical reaction at the atomic scale is crucial for guiding the structural design and performance optimization of supported metal catalysts. Recent advancements in in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have shed new light on these complex phenomena, providing deeper insights into the SMSI dynamics. Here, the research progress of in&#8208;situ TEM investigation on SMSI in heterogeneous catalysis is systematically reviewed, focusing on the formation dynamics, structural evolution during the catalytic reactions, and regulation methods of SMSI. The significant advantages of in&#8208;situ TEM technologies for SMSI research are also highlighted. Moreover, the challenges and probable development paths of in&#8208;situ TEM studies on the SMSI are also provided.</dc:description>

Here, the research progress of in-situ TEM investigation on SMSI in heterogeneous catalysis is systematically reviewed, focusing on the formation dynamics, structural evolution during the catalytic reactions, and regulation methods of SMSI. The significant advantages of in-situ TEM technologies for SMSI research are also highlighted. Moreover, the challenges and probable development paths of in-situ TEM studies on the SMSI are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemodivergent Parallel Kinetic Resolution of Paracyclophanes: Enantiomer Fishing with Different Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented chemodivergent strategy for parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) is disclosed through which two planar chiral products bearing different structures were simultaneously afforded with opposite stereoselectivities. Two achiral esters are activated by one single chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to react with the different enantiomers of the racemic imine substrate in a parallel fashion. Two products bearing distinct structures and opposite stereoselectivities are respectively afforded from the same reaction system in good to excellent yields, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Control experiments and kinetic studies are carried out to probe the kinetic and dynamic properties during the reaction progress. The planar chiral pyridine and lactam products show interesting applications in both asymmetric synthesis and pesticide development.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Spinel Oxides via Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Phase Boundary Construction for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the origin of surface reconstruction is crucial for developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides. Traditionally, the reconstruction has been achieved through electrochemical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this work, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 catalyst was an irreversible oxygen redox chemical reaction. And a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (EO&#8208;V) could benefit the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Motivated by this finding, a strategy of phase boundary construction from Co tetrahedral to octahedral was employed to decrease EO&#8208;V in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results showed that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rose to 64%, a 3.5 nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer formed on the catalyst surface with a 158 mV decrease in overpotential. Further experiments indicated that the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8208;T) phase would result in lattice mismatch, promoting non&#8208;bonding oxygen states and lowering EO&#8208;V. Then more active lattice oxygen combined with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8208;), followed by soluble cation leaching, which enhanced the reconstruction process. This work provided new insights into the relationship between the intrinsic structure of pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

Abstract
We report a photochemical method for the semipinacol rearrangement of unactivated allylic alcohols. Aliphatic as well as aromatic groups participate as migrating groups, yielding a variety of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with ethers, esters, halides, nitriles, carbamates, and substituted arenes. The operationally simple and fully catalytic conditions prescribe 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Co&#8208;salen, and 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% lutidinium triflate and, importantly, display reactivity complementary to procedures employing Br&#248;nsted acid. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversifications.

         <title>Interfacial Stabilization by Prelithiated Trithiocyanuric Acid as an Organic Additive in Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile bulk functionalization of Li6PS5Cl with prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid is introduced as an organic additive strategy to stabilize the interfaces in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. This approach improves electrochemical performance markedly due to the formation of a highly stable Li2S deficient and Li3P&#8208;rich interface with Li metal anode.







Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) with a lithium metal anode (LMA) is a promising candidate to surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their inherent safety against fire hazards and potential to achieve a higher energy density. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window and chemical reactivity of the sulfide solid electrolyte towards the LMA results in interfacial degradation and poor electrochemical performance. In this direction, we introduce an organic additive approach, that is the mixing of prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid, Li3TCA, with Li6PS5Cl, to establish a stable interface while preserving high ionic conductivity. Including 2.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% Li3TCA alleviates the decomposition of the electrolyte on the lithium metal interface, decreasing the Li2S content in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) thus forming a more stable interface. In Li|Li symmetric cells, this strategy enables a rise in the critical current density from 1.0 to 1.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling for over 750&#8197;hours at a high current density of 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This approach also enables Li|NbO&#8208;NCM811 full cell to operate more than 500&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C.

         <title>Elucidating the Discrepancy between the Intrinsic Structural Instability and the Apparent Catalytic Steadiness of M&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability under OER potential would experience unconventional structure reconstruction. The initial stable Ni&#8722;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8722;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8722;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the internal conflict between structural and catalytic stability.







Abstract
Despite the widespread investigations on the M&#8208;N&#8208;C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure&#8208;property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well&#8208;designed pH&#8208;dependent metal leaching experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni&#8722;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8722;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8722;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.

         <title>Improving Miscibility of Polymer Donor and Polymer Acceptor by Reducing Chain Entanglement for Realizing 18.64&#8201;% Efficiency All Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer acceptors with BDD units have been developed with large internal space and pronounced steric hindrance, mitigating the entanglements between adjacent polymer chains and increasing the miscibility of polymer donor and polymer acceptor, thus achieving high efficiencies of 17.50&#8201;% and 18.64&#8201;% in binary and ternary blend all&#8208;polymer solar cells.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells have experienced rapid development in recent years by the emergence of polymerized small molecular acceptors (PSMAs). However, the strong chain entanglements of polymer donors (PDs) and polymer acceptors (PAs) decrease the miscibility of the resulting polymer mixtures, making it challenging to optimize the blend morphology. Herein, we designed three PAs, namely PBTPICm&#8208;BDD, PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD, by smartly using a BDD unit as the polymerized unit to copolymerize with different Y&#8208;typed non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs), thus achieving a certain degree of distortion and giving the polymer system enough internal space to reduce the entanglements of the polymer chains. Such effects increase the chances of the PD being interspersed into the acceptor material, which improve the solubility between the PD and PA. The PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD displayed better miscibility with PBQx&#8208;TCl, leading to a well optimized morphology. As a result, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.50&#8201;% and 17.17&#8201;% were achieved for PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPICF&#8208;BDD devices, respectively. With the addition of PYFT&#8208;o as the third component into PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD blend to further extend the absorption spectral coverage and finely tune microstructures of the blend morphology, a remarkable PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was realized finally.

         <title>Hidden Impurities Generate False Positives in Single Atom Catalyst Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research addresses a critical issue in the characterization of single&#8208;atom catalysts, namely the challenge of correctly identifying and distinguishing impurities and active sites at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are an emerging class of materials, leveraging maximum atom utilization and distinctive structural and electronic properties to bridge heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Direct imaging methods, such as aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, are commonly applied to confirm the atomic dispersion of active sites. However, interpretations of data from these techniques can be challenging due to simultaneous contributions to intensity from impurities introduced during synthesis processes, as well as any variation in position relative to the focal plane of the electron beam. To address this matter, this paper presents a comprehensive study on two representative SACs containing isolated nickel or copper atoms. Spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, were employed to prove the high metal dispersion of the catalytic atoms. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging combined with single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, we scrutinized thin specimens of the catalysts to provide an unambiguous chemical identification of the observed single&#8208;atom species and thereby distinguish impurities from active sites at the single&#8208;atom level. Overall, the study underscores the complexity of SACs characterization and establishes the importance of the use of spectroscopy in tandem with imaging at atomic resolution to fully and reliably characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This essay tackles challenges in polymer electrolytes for RMBs, introducing a novel strategy: anion modification and &#8220;thiol&#8208;ene&#8221; click chemistry. The resulting polymer electrolyte exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, tMg2+, compatibility with Mg anode and stable performance under wide temperature range. Comprehensive analysis deepens understanding of inner interactions in electrolyte, paving the way for future advancements.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes play a crucial role in advancing rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) owing to their exceptional characteristics, including high flexibility, superior interface compatibility, broad electrochemical stability window, and enhanced safety features. Despite these advantages, research in this domain remains nascent, plagued by single preparation approaches and challenges associated with the compatibility between polymer electrolytes and Mg metal anode. In this study, we present a novel synthesis strategy to fabricate a glycerol &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diallyl ether&#8208;3,6&#8208;dioxa&#8208;1,8&#8208;octanedithiol&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte supported by glass fiber substrate (GDT@GF CGPE) through anion modification and thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry polymerization. The developed route exhibits novelty and high efficiency, leading to the production of GDT@GF CGPEs featuring exceptional mechanical properties, heightened ionic conductivity, elevated Mg2+ transference number, and commendable compatibility with Mg anode. The assembled modified Mo6S8||GDT@GF||Mg cells exhibit outstanding performance across a wide temperature range and address critical safety concerns, showcasing the potential for applications under extreme conditions. Our innovative preparation strategy offers a promising avenue for the advancement of polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;performance rechargeable magnesium batteries, while also opens up possibilities for future large&#8208;scale applications and the development of flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Efficient Self&#8208;Sorting Behaviours of Metallacages with Subtle Structural Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the self&#8208;sorting behaviour of assemblies with subtle structural differences is a captivating yet challenging endeavour. Herein, we elucidate the unusual self&#8208;sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets. Narcissistic self&#8208;sorting of metallacages has been observed for two ligands with identical sizes, shapes, and symmetries, with only minor differences in the substituted groups. In particular, the self&#8208;sorting process in microdroplets occurs within 1 min at room temperature, in stark contrast to batch reactors, which require equilibration for 30 min. To reveal the mechanism of self&#8208;sorting and the role of microdroplets, we conducted a series of experiments and theoretical calculations, including competitive self&#8208;assembly, cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation, control experiments involving model metallacages with larger cavities, noncovalent interaction analysis, and root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis. This research demonstrates an unusual case of self&#8208;sorting of very similar assemblies and provides a new strategy for facilitating the self&#8208;sorting efficiency of supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizing Aniline&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures to Attain beyond 22% Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The characteristics of the soft component and the ionic&#8208;electronic nature in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;xBrxperovskite typically lead to a significant number of halide vacancy defects and ions migration, resulting in a reduction in both photovoltaic efficiency and stability. Herein, we present a tailored approach in which both anion&#8208;fixation and undercoordinated&#8208;Pb passivation are achieved in situ during crystallization by employing a molecule derived from aniline, specifically 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline (MFA), to address the above challenges. The incorporation of MFA into the perovskite film results in a pronounced inhibition of ion migration, a significant reduction in trap density, an enhancement in grain size, an extension of charge carrier lifetime, and a more favorable alignment of energy levels. These advantageous characteristics contribute to achieving a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.14% for the MFA&#8208;based CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite solar cells (PSCs), representing the highest efficiency reported thus far for this type of inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the resultant PSCs exhibits higher environmental stability and photostability. This strategy is anticipated to offer significant advantages for large&#8208;area fabrication, particularly in terms of simplicity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H Annulation Involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;Palladacycle Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving C,C&#8208;palladacycle intermediates provides a unique platform for developing novel reactions. However, the vast majority of studies have been limited to the transformations of C(aryl),C&#8208;palladacycles. In sharp contrast, catalytic reactions involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles have rarely been reported. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides undergo intramolecular Heck/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation to generate C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles, which can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to afford tricyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, this strategy can also be applied to indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides to construct pentacyclic fused pyridinediones via suquential Heck dearomatization/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. Notably, the removal of &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids in the reaction of alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can build an interesting tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate that five&#8208;membered C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles serve as the key intermediates. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ripening Enabled by Hygroscopic Salts for Hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free Printable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 20%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed perovskite films generally possess small grain sizes and high density of grain boundaries, which intensify non&#8208;radiative recombination of carriers and limits the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. In this study, we report the room&#8208;temperature ripening enabled by the synergy of hygroscopic salts and moisture in air for efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs). Treating perovskite films with proper hygroscopic salts in damp air induces obvious secondary recrystallization, which coarsens the grains size from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. It&#8217;s proposed that the hygroscopic salt at grain boundaries could absorb moisture and form a complex which could not only serve as mass transfer channel but also assist in the dissolution of perovskite grains. This activates mass transfer between small grains and large grains since they possess different solubilities, and thus ripens the perovskite film.  Consequently, p&#8208;MPSCs treated with the hygroscopic salt of NH4SCN show an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.13% from 17.94%, and maintain &gt;98% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point tracking at 55&#177;5&#176;C for 350 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Regulating Asymmetric Charge Distribution by Single&#8208;Atom Central Doped Ag&#8208;Based Series Clusters for Enhanced Photoreduction of CO2 to Alcohol Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiently photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) into liquid fuels in pure water system remains challenged. Iron polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) with strong light harvesting, unique Fe&#8208;N4 structure, abundant pores, and good stability could serve as a promising catalyst for CO2 photoreduction. To further improve the catalytic efficiency, herein, symmetry&#8208;breaking Fe sites are constructed by coupling with atomically precise M1Ag24 (M=Ag, Au, Pt) series clusters. Especially, the introduction of Pt1Ag24 causes the most asymmetric charge distribution of Fe in FePPc (followed by Au1Ag24 and Ag25), leading to the favorable CO2 adsorption and activation. In addition, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc exhibits the most effective photogenerated carriers transfer and separation. As a result, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc shows the methanol/ethanol yield of 48.55/32.97 &#956;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 in H2O&#8208;CO2 system under visible light irradiation, ~ 1.65/1.25&#8208;fold, 1.83/1.37&#8208;fold, and 3.6/1.61&#8208;fold higher than that of Au1Ag24&#8208;FePPc, Ag25&#8208;FePPc, and FePPc, respectively. This work provides a concept for precisely construction and regulation symmetry&#8208;breaking sites of cluster&#8208;based catalysts for effective CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO2/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO2/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO2 permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high&#8208;performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In almost all electrochemical systems for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis, electrodes are connected with an external power source, either directly or via wireless energy transfer circuit. That is inconvenient and makes some applications impossible. Herein, we both use galvanized iron with two different metals as both power source and electrodes to achieve a self&#8208;powered ECL and exploit ECL for the imaging of the corrosion of protective coating of widely used metal (e.g. galvanized iron) for the first time. The self&#8208;powered ECL enables the visualization of the deterioration of galvanic coating on iron using a smartphone and the detection of ascorbic acid with a linear range of 0.5&#8208;100 &#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.31 &#956;M. The devices based on self&#8208;powered approach do not require external power supply, thus effectively reducing their volume and cost. The self&#8208;powered ECL holds great promise for metal corrosion imaging and analytical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Channels Based on Bottlebrush Polymers: Enhanced Ion Transport Through Polymer Topology Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers can be used to mimic natural ion channels when functionalized with ion&#8208;binding urea groups. The unique topology of these polymer channels enables efficient and selective ion transport across lipid bilayers, highlighting the importance of topology control in designing polymer&#8208;based ion transport systems.







Abstract
Synthetic structures mimicking the transport function of natural ion channel proteins have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic treatments, separation membranes, sensing, and biotechnologies. However, the development of polymer&#8208;based artificial channels has been hampered due to the limitation on available models. In this study, we demonstrate the great potential of bottlebrush polymers as accessible and versatile molecular scaffolds for developing efficient artificial ion channels. Adopting the bottlebrush configuration enhanced ion transport activity of the channels compared to their linear analogs. Matching the structure of lipid bilayers, the bottlebrush channel with a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic triblock architecture exhibited the highest activity among the series. Functionalized with urea groups, these channels displayed high anion selectivity. Additionally, we illustrated that the transport properties could be fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the chemistry of ion binding sites. This work not only highlights the importance of polymer topology control in channel design, but also reveals the great potential for further developing bottlebrush channels with customized features and diverse functionalities.

         <title>Fully sp2 Carbon&#8208;conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Multiple Active Sites for Advanced Lithium&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b':5,6&#8208;b'']trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in&#8208;situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 with 97.9% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5.0 A g&#8208;1), and excellent cycling performance (184 mAh g&#8208;1 over 8000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8208;1 with 0.00365% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared, in&#8208;situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Overall Kinetics by Se&#8722;Br Chemistry in Rechargeable Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a multifunctional electrolyte additive PhSeBr has been successfully applied to Li&#8722;S batteries, which can exert synergistic influence on the electrodes and electrolyte, thus improving the kinetic behavior of lithium ion and reducing the high energy barrier of the solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur. The Li&#8722;S cell modified by PhSeBr displays the superior stability in both coin and pouch cells with the extreme conditions of high S loadings and low temperature.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries severely impedes the application in extreme conditions. Bridging the sulfur cathode and lithium anode, the electrolyte plays a crucial role in regulating kinetic behaviors of Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, we report a multifunctional electrolyte additive of phenyl selenium bromide (PhSeBr) to simultaneously exert positive influences on both electrodes and the electrolyte. For the cathode, an ideal conversion routine with lower energy barrier can be attained by the redox mediator and homogeneous catalyst derived from PhSeBr, thus improving the reaction kinetics and utilization of sulfur. Meanwhile, the presence of Se&#8722;Br bond helps to reconstruct a loose solvation sheath of lithium ions and a robust bilayer SEI with excellent ionic conductivity, which contributes to reducing the de&#8208;solvation energy and simultaneously enhancing the interfacial kinetics. The Li&#8722;S battery with PhSeBr displays superior long cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 1164.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C rate. And the pouch cell exhibits a maximum capacity of 845.3&#8197;mAh and a capacity retention of 94.8&#8201;% after 50&#8197;cycles. Excellent electrochemical properties are also obtained in extreme conditions of high sulfur loadings and low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work demonstrates the versatility and practicability of the special additive, striking out an efficient but simple method to design advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Transient Structural Properties of the Rho GDP&#8208;Dissociation Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex formation between GTPases and their partially disordered nucleotide dissociation inhibitors has been assumed to rely on folding upon binding. Here, Medina Gomez et&#8197;al. show that instead, pertinent structural features are equally representative, both in apo inhibitor and the complex, as transient structural properties, which revises the mechanisms of membrane extraction.







Abstract
Rho GTPases, master spatial regulators of a wide range of cellular processes, are orchestrated by complex formation with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs). These have been thought to possess an unstructured N&#8208;terminus that inhibits nucleotide exchange of their client upon binding/folding. Via NMR analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays, we reveal instead pertinent structural properties transiently maintained both, in the presence and absence of the client, imposed onto the terminus context&#8208;specifically by modulating interactions with the surface of the folded C&#8208;terminal domain. These observations revise the long&#8208;standing textbook picture of the GTPases&#8217; mechanism of membrane extraction. Rather than by a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition upon binding of an inhibitory peptide, the intricate and highly selective extraction process of RhoGTPases is orchestrated via a dynamic ensemble bearing preformed transient structural properties, suitably modulated by the specific surrounding along the multi&#8208;step process.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Molecular Sieving of High&#8208;Humidity C2H4/C2H6 Mixture by a Hydrophobic Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic and flexible metal&#8211;organic framework shows weak adsorption affinity and high structural transition pressure at ambient temperature, which enables C2H4/C2H6 molecular sieving under high&#8208;pressure and wet conditions.







Abstract
Molecular sieving is an ideal separation mechanism, but controlling pore size, restricting framework flexibility, and avoiding strong adsorption are all very challenging. Here, we report a flexible adsorbent showing molecular sieving at ambient temperature and high pressure, even under high humidity. While typical guest&#8208;induced transformations are observed, a high transition pressure of 16.6&#8197;atm is observed for C2H4 at 298&#8197;K because of very weak C2H4 adsorption (~16&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Also, C2H6 is completely excluded below the pore&#8208;opening pressure of 7.7&#8197;atm, giving single&#8208;component selectivity of ca. 300. Quantitative high&#8208;pressure column breakthrough experiments using 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C2H4/C2H6 mixtures at 10&#8197;atm as input confirm molecular sieving with C2H4 adsorption of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 or 32&#8197;cm3(STP) cm&#8722;3 and negligible C2H6 adsorption of 0.001(2) mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the adsorbent can be completely regenerated by inert gas purging. Furthermore, it is highly hydrophobic with negligible water adsorption, and the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance is unaffected at high humidity.

         <title>Light and Guest Responsive Behavior in a Porous Coordination Network Enabled by Reversible [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a light and guest responsive physisorbent which exhibited gas&#8208;induced nonporous to porous switching and [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV irradiation or sunlight. The phase transformations were enabled by flexible olefinic linker ligands and occurred in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion (2D sql to 3D mot topology). Activated variants exhibited different stepped isotherm profiles when exposed to CO2 at 195&#8197;K.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents that undergo reversible structural transformations induced by external stimuli (e.g. light, guests, or heat) offer the promise of utility in gas storage and separation.

     alt="Light and Guest Responsive Behavior in a Porous Coordination Network Enabled by Reversible [2+2] Photocycloaddition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a light and guest responsive physisorbent which exhibited gas-induced nonporous to porous switching and [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV irradiation or sunlight. The phase transformations were enabled by flexible olefinic linker ligands and occurred in single-crystal-to-single-crystal fashion (2D &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt; to 3D &lt;b&gt;mot&lt;/b&gt; topology). Activated variants exhibited different stepped isotherm profiles when exposed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 195&#8197;K.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive physisorbents that undergo reversible structural transformations induced by external stimuli (e.g. light, guests, or heat) offer the promise of utility in gas storage and separation. Whereas reports on guest or light-responsive sorbents have increased in recent years, we are unaware of reports on sorbents that exhibit both light and guest-induced structural transformations. Herein, we report that the square lattice, &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt;, topology coordination network Zn(fba)(bis)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMF (&lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt;, 5=trans-4,4&#8242;-bis(1-imidazolyl)stilbene=bis, 6=2,2-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane=H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;fba) underwent single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation (SCSC) upon activation, affording nonporous &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt;. Parallel alignment at 3.23&#8197;&#197; of olefinic moieties on adjacent bis ligands in &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt; enabled SCSC [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV light (365&#8197;nm) or sunlight. &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt; thereby transformed to &lt;b&gt;mot-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt;, which was subsequently activated to the narrow pore phase &lt;b&gt;mot-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;mot-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt; both exhibited S-shaped adsorption isotherms characteristic of guest-induced structural changes when exposed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 195&#8197;K (type-F&#8211;IV and type&#8197;F&#8211;I, respectively).

         <title>Structural Degradation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C (M=Co, Ni and Fe) Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts at Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density for Long&#8208;Term Reduction</title>

Structural degradation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C (M=Co, Ni, and Fe) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) used as cathode materials at industrial&#8208;grade current density during long&#8208;term reduction is demonstrated. Both M&#8208;N and N&#8208;C are broken, resulting in the dissolution of N and the formation of M&#8208;containing core&#8211;shell nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting the electrocatalytic performances.







Abstract
M&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrode materials for many electro&#8208;reduction reactions. However, their stability is far from practical applications, and their deactivation mechanism has been rarely investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the structural degradation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C (M=Co, Ni, and Fe) at industrial&#8208;grade current density for long&#8208;term electro&#8208;reduction. Both M&#8208;N and N&#8208;C bonds are broken, resulting in the gradual hydrogenation and dissolution of N in the form of ammonia. The residual M is finally converted to M&#8208;containing core&#8211;shell nanoparticles after sequential dissolution, redeposition, and electro&#8208;reduction. The destruction of the M&#8208;N&#8208;C structure and the formation of nanoparticles greatly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Our work highlights the structural degradation and deactivation mechanism of M&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;type SACs under strong reductive conditions and provides useful information for inspiring researchers to develop new strategies to improve the electrocatalytic stability of similar types of materials.

         <title>Continuous Transformation from Membrane&#8208;Less Coacervates to Membranized Coacervates and Giant Vesicles: Toward Multicompartmental Protocells with Complex (Membrane) Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous protocell transformation system is developed. In a meticulously controlled anionic terpolymer concentration&#8208;dependent process, membrane&#8208;less coacervates can be induced into membranized coacervates and, ultimately, into giant hybrid vesicles. This transition endows protocells with diverse structural features in this system and further promotes the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments.







Abstract
The membranization of membrane&#8208;less coacervates paves the way for the exploitation of complex protocells with regard to structural and cell&#8208;like functional behaviors. However, the controlled transformation from membranized coacervates to vesicles remains a challenge. This can provide stable (multi)phase and (multi)compartmental architectures through the reconfiguration of coacervate droplets in the presence of (bioactive) polymers, bio(macro)molecules and/or nanoobjects. Herein, we present a continuous protocell transformation from membrane&#8208;less coacervates to membranized coacervates and, ultimately, to giant hybrid vesicles. This transformation process is orchestrated by altering the balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions through varying concentrations of an anionic terpolymer, leading to dynamic processes such as spontaneous membranization of terpolymer nanoparticles at the coacervate surface, disassembly of the coacervate phase mediated by the excess anionic charge, and the redistribution of coacervate components in membrane. The diverse protocells during the transformation course provide distinct structural features and molecular permeability. Notably, the introduction of multiphase coacervates in this continuous transformation process signifies advancements toward the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments. Our findings emphasize the highly controlled continuous structural reorganization of coacervate protocells and represents a novel step toward the development of advanced and sophisticated synthetic protocells with more precise compositions and complex (membrane) structures.

         <title>BF2&#8208;Bridged Azafulvene Dimer&#8208;Based 1064&#8201;nm Laser&#8208;Driven Superior Photothermal Agent for Deep&#8208;Seated Tumor Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A BF2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer&#8208;based superior photothermal agent (OTTBF) with high MEC was designed for combating the deep&#8208;seated tumor in NIR&#8208;II window. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D&#8208;A&#8208;D structured NIR&#8208;II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with absorption bands located in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window are highly desirable for effectively combating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, the rarely reported NIR&#8208;II absorbing PTAs still suffer from a low molar extinction coefficient (MEC, &#1013;), inadequate chemostability and photostability, as well as the high light power density required during the therapeutic process. Herein, we developed a series of boron difluoride bridged azafulvene dimer acceptor&#8208;integrated small organic PTAs. The B&#8208;N coordination bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated azafulvene dimer backbone endow it the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, facilitating the vigorous donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) structure PTAs with NIR&#8208;II absorption. Notably, the PTA namely OTTBF shows high MEC (7.21&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), ultrahigh chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. After encapsulated into water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticles, OTTBF NPs can achieve remarkable photothermal conversion effect under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation with a light density as low as 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the lowest reported NIR&#8208;II light power used in PTT process as we know. Furthermore, OTTBF NPs have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo deep&#8208;seated cancer treatments under 1064&#8197;nm laser. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D&#8208;A&#8208;D structured NIR&#8208;II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.

         <title>Spin Symmetry Breaking&#8208;Induced Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure in N&#8208;Coordinated MnO2 for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have achieved a functionality breakthrough of &#8220;Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure&#8221; on N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO) with asymmetric spin states, which is marked by the formation of uniform Hubbard bands. This character can play a crucial role in fostering coherent electronic spin transport and enhancing the rapid kinetics of the system.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), however, their performance is hindered by a substantial Hubbard gap, which limits electron transfer and battery cyclability. Addressing this, we introduce a heteroatom coordination approach, using triethanolamine to induce axial N coordination on Mn centers in MnO2, yielding N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO). This approach leverages the change of electronegativity disparity between Mn and ligands (O and N) to disrupt spin symmetry and augment spin polarization. This enhancement leads to the closure of the Hubbard gap, primarily driven by the intensified occupancy of the Mn eg orbitals. The resultant TEAMO exhibit a significant increase in storage capacity, reaching 351&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our findings suggest a viable strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of TMO cathodes, enhancing the potential of ZIBs in energy storage technology.

&lt;p&gt;We have achieved a functionality breakthrough of &#8220;Hubbard Gap Near-Closure&#8221; on N-coordinated MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (TEAMO) with asymmetric spin states, which is marked by the formation of uniform Hubbard bands. This character can play a crucial role in fostering coherent electronic spin transport and enhancing the rapid kinetics of the system.

         <title>Enantioselective Relay Coupling of Perfluoroalkyl and Vinylogous Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe an enantioselective radical relay coupling catalyzed by a chiral bifuncational NHC. This approach gives easy access to chiral carboxylate derivatives with sterically hindered sp3 carbon branches. An unconventional syn&#8208;syn conformation of the squaramide motif was found critical in the stereocontrol through hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Chiral carboxylic acids and their derivatives are highly valuable structural motifs in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, the introduction of a sterically demanding sidechain to the &#946;&#8208;carbon, such as an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, remains a significant challenge in classical polar processes. Recently, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) mediated coupling reactions involving persistent ketyl radicals have emerged as a promising strategy to assemble highly crowded carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Nevertheless, achieving enantioselectivity in these reactions remains highly challenging. In this work, we report our recent progress in controlling enantioselectivity for relay coupling of perfluoroalkyl and persistent vinylogous ketyl radicals. We developed a chiral bifunctional NHC&#8208;squaramide catalyst that achieves high facial selectivity in a critical bond&#8208;forming event involving the coupling of a congested tertiary carbon radical and vinylogous ketyl radical. Chiral carboxylates bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at the &#946;&#8208;position can be prepared in good yield and excellent enantiomeric excess. Results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments indicate that the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl squaramide motif adopts an unusual syn&#8208;syn conformation, enabling hydrogen bonding interactions with the enolate oxygen, thereby rigidifying the overall conformation of the transition state.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of industrial semi&#8208;hydrogenation of trace alkynes amidst alkene feedstocks, the pivotal challenge lies in circumventing the hydrogenation of alkenes. Herein, we present Zr(OH)4 as an innovative catalyst for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, demonstrating remarkable selectivity towards styrene (&gt;96%), while exhibiting inactivity towards free styrene. Notably, Zr(OH)4 achieves a 95% conversion of quasi&#8208;industry 1 mol% phenylacetylene within styrene, with a mere 0.44% styrene loss. Experimental and theoretical results confirm both terminal Zr&#8208;O&#8208;H and bridge Zr&#8208;O&#8208;H can dissociate H2, while the terminal Zr&#8208;O&#8208;H plays a crucial role on activating phenylacetylene through the sequential hydrogenation process of C6H5C&#8801;CH&#8594;C6H5C=CH2&#8594;C6H5CH=CH2. The high rate of phenylacetylene removal is attributed to its strong adsorption capacity, while Zr(OH)4 has a significantly weaker adsorption capacity for styrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Acid Enabled Comprehensive Training of Poly (Sodium Acrylate) Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, general, and reversible training strategy assisted by strong&#8208;acids with two&#8208;steps is proposed to enable comprehensive improvement of the poly (sodium acrylate) network&#8208;based hydrogels by constructing dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, as well as show significantly mechanical improvement in Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture stress.







Abstract
The design of admirable hydrogel networks is of both practical and fundamental importance for diverse applications of hydrogels. Herein a general strategy of acid&#8208;assisted training is designed to enable multiple improvements of conventional poly (sodium acrylate) networks for hydrogels. Hydrophobic homogeneous crosslinked poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels are prepared to verify the strategy. The multiple improvements of poly (sodium acrylate) networks are simply achieved by immersing the hydrogel networks into 4&#8197;M H2SO4 solutions. The introduced acids would induce transformation of poly (sodium acrylate) into poly (acrylic acid) at hydrogel surface, which constructs dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions to tighten the network. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, and show mechanical improvement. The internal poly (sodium acrylate) of the pristine acid&#8208;containing hydrogels is further fully transformed via acid&#8208;infiltration after following cyclic stretch/release training to significantly improve the mechanical performance. The Young's modulus, stress, and toughness of the fully&#8208;trained hydrogels are 187.6&#8197;times, 35.6&#8197;times, and 5.4&#8197;times enhanced, respectively. The polymeric networks retain isotropic in fully&#8208;trained hydrogels to ensure superior stretchability of 8.6. The acid&#8208;assisted training performance of the hydrogels can be reversibly recovered by NaOH neutralization. The acid&#8208;assisted training strategy here is general for poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels.

         <title>Hyperpolarizing Small Molecules using Parahydrogen and Solid&#8208;State Spin Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization is a simple low&#8208;cost approach for hyperpolarizing molecules to enhance their NMR signals, but requires specific hydrogenation chemistry. A new approach is shown to hyperpolarize a wider range of target molecules via solid state mixing with a pre&#8208;hyperpolarized source molecule. The mechanism of polarization transfer from the source to the target molecules is solid&#8208;state spin diffusion.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an inexpensive way to produce hyperpolarized molecules with polarization levels of &gt;10&#8201;% in the solution&#8208;state, but is strongly limited in generality since it requires chemical reactions/ interactions with H2. Here we report a new method to widen the scope of PHIP hyperpolarization: a source molecule is produced via PHIP with high 13C polarization, and precipitated out of solution together with a target species. Spin diffusion within the solid carries the polarization onto 13C spins of the target, which can then be dissolved for solution&#8208;state applications. We name this method PHIP&#8208;SSD (PHIP with solid&#8208;state spin diffusion) and demonstrate it using PHIP&#8208;polarized [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;fumarate as the source molecule, to polarize different 13C&#8208;labelled target molecules. 13C polarizations of between 0.01 and 3&#8201;% were measured on [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid, depending on the molar ratio of fumarate:benzoate in the solid state. We also show that PHIP&#8208;SSD does not require specific co&#8208;crystallization conditions by grinding dry powders of target molecules together with solid fumarate crystals, and obtain 13C signal enhancements of between 100 and 200 on [13C,15N2]&#8208;urea, [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;pyruvate, and [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid. This approach appears to be a promising new strategy for facile hyperpolarization based on PHIP.

         <title>Oxygen Functional Groups Regulate Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Molecular Electrocatalyst for Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A local&#8208;environmental regulation infinitely clarifies distinguishing interaction manners (remote or vicinal interaction) between different oxygen functional groups and Co center, and hence enhances the acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor represents a promising approach to industrial&#8208;level H2O2 production, while it is hampered by the lack of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts in acidic medium. Herein, we present a strategy for the specific oxygen functional group (OFG) regulation to promote the H2O2 selectivity up to 92&#8201;% in acid on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular assembled with reduced graphene oxide. In situ X&#8208;ray adsorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy combined with theoretical calculation unravel that different OFGs exert distinctive regulation effects on the electronic structure of Co center through either remote (carboxyl and epoxy) or vicinal (hydroxyl) interaction manners, thus leading to the opposite influences on the promotion in 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity. As a consequence, the PEM electrolyzer integrated with the optimized catalyst can continuously and stably produce the high&#8208;concentration of ca. 7&#8197;wt&#8201;% pure H2O2 aqueous solution at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 200&#8197;h with a cell voltage as low as ca. 2.1&#8197;V, suggesting the application potential in industrial&#8208;scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Allylboration of Acetylene: A Versatile Tool for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the enantioselective conversion of acetylene gas under ambient temperature and pressure into a chiral orthogonally functionalized skipped diene is reported. The product represents a privileged scaffold to access the full set of stereoisomers of the chiral skipped diene core through simple stereodivergent pathways, thus serving as a versatile intermediate for the enantioselective total synthesis of natural skipped diene products.







Abstract
Efficient catalytic methods that allow the use of simple and abundant chemical feedstocks for the preparation of synthetically versatile compounds are central to modern synthetic chemistry. Acetylene is a basic feedstock with a remarkable production over one million tons per year, although it is underutilized in the stereoselective synthesis of fine chemicals. Here we report a facile catalytic multicomponent reaction that allows for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective allylboration of acetylene gas. This process is catalyzed by a chiral copper catalyst, operates without specialized equipment or pressurization, and provides chiral skipped dienes bearing stereodefined and orthogonally functionalized olefins with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The combined stereochemical features and orthogonal functionalization make the products privileged structural scaffolds to access the complete set of stereoisomers of the chiral skipped diene core through simple enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent pathways. The utility of the method is demonstrated with the enantioselective synthesis of three bioactive natural skipped diene products, namely (+)&#8208;Nyasol, (+)&#8208;Hinokiresinol and Phorbasin C, and other related synthetically relevant chiral molecules.

         <title>Lithium Hydride in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries as a Pulverization Accelerator of Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pulverization&#8208;related electrochemical degradation of the silicon anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is closely associated with the presence of LiH in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). During the de&#8208;lithiation process of the silicon&#8208;based anode, the reverse lithiation of LiH on micron&#8208;sized silicon particles significantly increases the localized stress within the particles, accelerating particle pulverization.







Abstract
As a highly promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;specific capacity anode, the industrial&#8208;scale utilization of micron silicon has been hindered by the issue of pulverization during cycling. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of regulating the inorganic components of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in improving pulverization, the evolution of most key inorganic components in the SEI and their correlation with silicon failure mechanisms remain ambiguous. This study provides a clear and direct correlation between the lithium hydride (LiH) in the SEI and the degree of micron silicon pulverization in the battery system. The reverse lithiation behavior of LiH on micron silicon during de&#8208;lithiation exacerbates the localized stress in silicon particles and contributes to particle pulverization. This work successfully proposes a novel approach to decouple the SEI from electrochemical performance, which can be significant to decipher the evolution of critical SEI components at varied battery anode interfaces and analyze their corresponding failure mechanisms.

         <title>Utilizing the Perfluoronaphthalene Radical Cation as a Selective Deelectronator to Access a Variety of Strongly Oxidizing Reactive Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron Theft: Upon removal of an electron, perfluoronaphthalene turns to the selective and powerful deelectronator radical cation [naphthaleneF]+&#8901;, with a potential of +2.00 (solution)/+2.41&#8197;V (solid&#8208;state) vs. Fc+/0. Its broad applicability, power, and selectivity are demonstrated by the reaction with a series of exemplarily chosen organ(ometall)ic molecules and elements.







Abstract
A selective deelectronation reagent with very high potential of +2.00 (solution)/+2.41&#8197;V (solid&#8208;state) vs. Fc+/0 and based on a room temperature stable perfluoronaphthalene (naphthaleneF) radical cation salt was developed and applied. The solid&#8208;state deelectronation of commercial naphthaleneF with [NO]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; generates [naphthaleneF]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=OC(CF3)3) in gram scale. Thermochemical analysis unravels the solid&#8208;state deelectronation potential of the starting [NO]+&#8208;reagent to be +2.34&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 with [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; counterion, but only +1.14&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 with the small [SbF6]&#8722; ion. Selective reactions demonstrate the selectivity of [naphthaleneF]+&#8901; for deelectronation of a multitude of organ(ometall)ic molecules and elements in solution: providing the molecular structures of the acene dications [tetracene]2+, [pentacene]2+ or spectroscopic evidence for the carbonyl complex of the ferrocene dication [Fc(CO)]2+, the [P9]+ cation from white phosphorus, the solvent&#8208;free copper(I) salt starting from copper metal and the dicationic Fe(IV)&#8208;scorpionate complex [Fe(sc)2]2+.

         <title>Efficient Capture and Low Energy Release of NH3 by Azophenol Decorated Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new UV/Vis photoresponsive covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;HNU38, was designed and synthesized by chemical integration of light&#8208;responsive azophenol units into the pore wall of an imine type COF as both light switch and NH3 adsorption sites. It was found that the COF exhibited efficient capture and low&#8208;energy release of NH3, and about 29.0&#8201;% of the adsorbed NH3 could be removed by vis&#8208;light irradiated cis&#8208;trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, while the remaining NH3 might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum.







Abstract
In NH3 capture technologies, the desorption process is usually driven by high temperature and low pressure (such as 150&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum), which accounts for intensive energy consumption and CO2 emission. Developing light responsive adsorbent is promising in this regard but remains a great challenge. Here, we for the first time designed and synthesized a light responsive azophenol&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF), COF&#8208;HNU38, to address this challenge. We found that at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1.0&#8197;bar, the cis &#8208;COF exhibited a NH3 uptake capacity of 7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a NH3/N2 selectivity of 158. In the adsorbed NH3, about 29.0&#8201;% could be removed by vis&#8208;light irradiated cis&#8208;trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the remaining NH3 might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. Almost no decrease in adsorption capacity was observed after eight adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. As such, an efficient NH3 capture and low energy release strategy was established thanks to the multiple hydrogen bond interactions (which are strong in total but weak in individuals) between NH3 and the smart COF, as well as the increased polarity and number of hydrogen bond sites after the trans&#8208;cis isomerization.

     alt="Efficient Capture and Low Energy Release of NH3 by Azophenol Decorated Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new UV/Vis photoresponsive covalent organic framework, COF-HNU38, was designed and synthesized by chemical integration of light-responsive azophenol units into the pore wall of an imine type COF as both light switch and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption sites. It was found that the COF exhibited efficient capture and low-energy release of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and about 29.0&#8201;% of the adsorbed NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could be removed by vis-light irradiated cis-trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, while the remaining NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; capture technologies, the desorption process is usually driven by high temperature and low pressure (such as 150&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum), which accounts for intensive energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission. Developing light responsive adsorbent is promising in this regard but remains a great challenge. Here, we for the first time designed and synthesized a light responsive azophenol-containing covalent organic framework (COF), COF-HNU38, to address this challenge. We found that at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1.0&#8197;bar, the cis -COF exhibited a NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity of 7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 158. In the adsorbed NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, about 29.0&#8201;% could be removed by vis-light irradiated cis-trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the remaining NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. Almost no decrease in adsorption capacity was observed after eight adsorption-desorption cycles. As such, an efficient NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; capture and low energy release strategy was established thanks to the multiple hydrogen bond interactions (which are strong in total but weak in individuals) between NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the smart COF, as well as the increased polarity and number of hydrogen bond sites after the trans-cis isomerization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metastable Supramolecular Assembly of Simple Monomers Enabled by Confinement: Towards Aqueous Phase Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable supramolecular assembly (SA) with aqueous phase room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is achieved by the confinement space of layered double hydroxide (LDH). The LDH energy trap can overcome the energy barrier of monomer ordered assembly and strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP.







Abstract
The application of supramolecular assembly (SA) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous phase has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields. However, using simple molecules with crystalline RTP to construct SA with aqueous phase RTP is hardly possible from the standpoint of forces. The reason lies in that the transition from crystal to SA involves a structure transformation from highly stable to more dynamic state, leading to increased non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathways and silent RTP signal. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple molecules (benzene derivatives) can successfully form metastable SA with aqueous phase RTP. The maximum of RTP lifetime and efficiency can reach 654.87&#8197;ms and 5.02&#8201;%, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal the LDH energy trap can strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional monomer, facilitating the development of SAs with aqueous phase RTP.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coupling&#8208;Induced Assembly Strategy for Constructing Artificial Shell on Mitochondria in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategy of in vivo self&#8208;assembly has been developed for improved enrichment and long&#8208;term retention of anticancer drug in tumor tissues. However, most self&#8208;assemblies with non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions are susceptible to complex physiological environments, leading to weak stability and loss of biological function. Here, we develop a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy to generate covalently crosslinked nanofibers, which is applied for in situ constructing artificial shell on mitochondria. The oxidation&#8208;responsive peptide&#8208;porphyrin conjugate P1 is synthesized, which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Under the oxidative microenvironment of mitochondria, the coupling of thiols in P1 causes the formation of dimers, which is further ordered and stacked into crosslinked nanofibers. As a result, the artificial shell is constructed on the mitochondria efficiently through multivalent cooperative interactions due to the increased binding sites. Under ultrasound (US) irradiation, the porphyrin molecules in the shell produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act on the adjacent mitochondrial membrane, exhibiting ~2&#8208;fold higher antitumor activity than nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the mitochondria&#8208;targeted CIA strategy provides a novel perspective on improved sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and shows potential applications in antitumor therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in a Photostable Ion&#8208;Paired Yb&#8208;Eu Heteronuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes have potential application in diverse fields and attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, the similar coordination reactivity of lanthanide ions has constrained the designability of target molecule with well&#8208;defined structure, and many attempts obtained statistical mixtures. Herein, an ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8208;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] (TpPy = tris[3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl]hydroborate, ND = 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;4&#8208;olate) was designed and synthesized. Thanks to the radius difference between Eu3+ (1.07 &#197;) and Yb3+ (0.98 &#197;) ions, the hexadentate TpPy ligand was selected to coordinate with Eu3+ and the Yb3+ with a smaller radius was chelated by bidentate ND ligand. As a result, the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis. Upon the excitation of Yb3+ at 980 nm, the upconversion emission of Eu3+ was realized through a cooperative sensitization process. Furthermore, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980 nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 (the time to 95% of the initial emission intensity) of 420 minutes. This work provides the first example of a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8208;Eu heteronuclear complex upconversion system and may bring insights into rational design of lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes.</dc:description>

Thanks to the radius difference between Eu3+ (1.07 &#197;) and Yb3+ (0.98 &#197;) ions, the hexadentate TpPy ligand was selected to coordinate with Eu3+ and the Yb3+ with a smaller radius was chelated by bidentate ND ligand. As a result, the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified by high-resolution mass spectrometry and single-crystal structure analysis. Upon the excitation of Yb3+ at 980 nm, the upconversion emission of Eu3+ was realized through a cooperative sensitization process. Furthermore, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high-power density 980 nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 (the time to 95% of the initial emission intensity) of 420 minutes. This work provides the first example of a pure ion-paired Yb-Eu heteronuclear complex upconversion system and may bring insights into rational design of lanthanide-based upconversion molecular complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High&#8208;Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt&#8208;based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO2 supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6% with 94% selectivity of propylene at 600 &#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5 molC3H6&#183;gPt&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO2 (23.5 molC3H6&#183;gPt&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60 h&#8208;1. In a high&#8208;entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high&#8208;entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004 h&#8208;1 during 200 hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550 &#176;C. Such high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating&#160;diverse&#160;components&#160;into&#160;metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can expand their scope of properties and applications.&#160;Stratified MOFs (sMOFs) consist of compositionally unique concentric domains (strata), offering unprecedented&#160;complexity through partitioning of structural and functional components.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A zirconocene dichloride&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation is reported that can be applied to non&#8208;activated and conjugated terminal and internal alkenes. It involves a catalytic Zr&#8208;walk process and leads to a selective conversion to the linear product. Lithium methoxide serves as mild catalyst activating agent, which significantly increases the applicability and operational simplicity in comparison to earlier zirconium(II)&#8208;based protocols. Supported by additional experiments and calculations, a mechanism via zirconium(IV) intermediates is proposed. Due to the benign nature and ready&#8208;availability of the zirconium catalyst, the reaction is an attractive alternative to established alkene hydrosilylation methods.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a highly crystalline self&#8208;assembled multilayer (SAMUL) that is fundamentally different from the conventional monolayer or disordered bilayer used for hole&#8208;extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SAMUL can be easily formed on ITO substrate to form better surface coverage for enhancing the performance and stability of PSCs. A detailed structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of molecules used for SAMUL is established through a systematic study of their crystallinity, molecular packing, and hole&#8208;transporting properties. These SAMULs are rationally optimized by varying their molecular structures and deposition through thermal evaporation or spin&#8208;coating for fabricating PSCs. The CbzNaphPPA&#8208;based SAMUL was chosen for fabricating inverted PSCs due to its highest crystallinity and hole mobility derived from the ordered H&#8208;aggregation, which resulted in a remarkably high fill factor of 86.45%. This enables a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07% to be achieved along with excellent device stability (94% of its initial PCE retained after continuous operation for 1200 h under 1&#8208;sun irradiation at maximum power point at 65&#176;C). Additionally, a record&#8208;high PCE of 23.50% could be achieved by adopting a thermally evaporated SAMUL. This greatly simplifies and broadens the scope for SAM to be used for large&#8208;area devices on diverse substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Effect Management via Entropy Variation Strategy to Improve the Catalyst Stability in Acetylene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic structure evolution of heterogeneous catalysts during reaction has gained great attention recently. However, controllably manipulating dynamic process and then feeding back catalyst design to extend the lifetime remains challenging. Herein, we proposed an entropy variation strategy to develop a dynamic CuZn&#8208;Co/HEOs catalyst, in which the non&#8208;active Co nano&#8208;islands play a crucial role in controlling thermal effect via timely capturing and utilizing reaction heat generated on the adjacent active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Specifically, heat sensitive Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion during the reaction. Under such heat dissipation effect, the CuZn&#8208;Co/HEOs catalyst exhibited 95.7% ethylene selectivity and amazing long&#8208;term stability (&gt;530 h) in the typical exothermic acetylene hydrogenation. Aiming at cultivating it as a catalyst with promising industrial potential, we proposed a simple regeneration approach via an entropy decreasing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 Sites Coupling Atop&#8208;type and Bridge&#8208;type Adsorbed *C1 for Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D functional porous frameworks offer a platform for studying the structure&#8208;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M&#8211;O4 or M&#8211;N4 units) and product selectivity (common CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu&#8211;N1O3 unit is constructed, labeled as BIT&#8208;119. When applied to CO2RR, BIT&#8208;119 could reach a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion with C2 partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0 mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu&#8211;O4 units, asymmetric Cu&#8211;N1O3 units lead to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu&#8722;N1O3 sites could simultaneously couple the atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8211;N site) adsorption of *C1 species to reach the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;2D functional porous frameworks offer a platform for studying the structure-activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M&#8211;O4 or M&#8211;N4 units) and product selectivity (common CO2-to-CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal-organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu&#8211;N1O3 unit is constructed, labeled as BIT-119. When applied to CO2RR, BIT-119 could reach a CO2-to-C2 conversion with C2 partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0 mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu&#8211;O4 units, asymmetric Cu&#8211;N1O3 units lead to the re-distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu&#8722;N1O3 sites could simultaneously couple the atop-type (on Cu site) and bridge-type (on Cu&#8211;N site) adsorption of *C1 species to reach the CO2-to-C2 conversion. This work broadens the feasible C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on 2D functional porous frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct excitation strategy for deacylative couplings of ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homolysis of chemical bonds represents one of the most fundamental reactivities of excited molecules. Historically, it has been exploited to generate radicals under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. However, unlike most contemporary radical&#8208;generating mechanisms, the direct excitation to homolyze chemical bonds and produce aliphatic carbon&#8208;centered radicals under visible light remains rare, especially in metallaphotoredox cross couplings. Herein, we present our design of the dihydropyrimidoquinolinone (DHPQ) reagents derived from ketones, which can undergo formal deacylation and homolytic C&#8211;C bond cleavage to release alkyl radicals without external photocatalysts. Spectroscopic and computational analysis reveal unique optical and structural features of DHPQs, rationalizing their faster kinetics in alkyl radical generation than a structurally similar but visible&#8208;light transparent radical precursor. Such a capability allows DHPQ to facilitate a wide range of Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox cross couplings with aryl, alkynyl and acyl halides. Other catalytic and non&#8208;catalyzed alkylative transformations of DHPQs are also feasible with various radical acceptors. We believe this work would be of broad interest, aiding the synthetic planning with simplified operation and expanding the synthetic reach of photocatalyst&#8208;free approaches in cutting&#8208;edge research.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8208;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8208;guest complexes with a 1:1&#160;stoichiometry&#160;in MeCN. 7&#160;exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8208;500 nm) due to containing two selenoviologen&#160;(SeV2+)&#160;units.&#160;Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132 &#956;mol), generation rate (11 &#956;mol/h),&#160;turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Vesicle Microreactors for Oscillating ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We construct a compartmentalized nanoarchitecture to regulate bioenergy level. Glucose dehydrogenase, urease and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are encapsulated inside through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. ATPase and glucose transporter embedded in hybrid liposomes are attached at the surface. Glucose is transported and converted to gluconic acid catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase, resulting in an outward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP synthesis. In parallel, urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to generate ammonia, which leads to an inward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP hydrolysis. These processes lead to a change of the direction of proton gradient, thus achieving artificial ATP oscillation. Importantly, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation can be programmed. The work explores nanoarchitectonics integrating multiple components to realize artificial and precise oscillation of bioenergy level.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Mixed Plastics of Polyester and CO2&#8208;Based Polycarbonate to a Single Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lactone/epoxide bifunctional monomer is polymerized orthogonally to polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate which, including their mixture (physical blend), can be depolymerized back to the same, single monomer with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity, realizing the closed&#8208;loop recycling of a mixture of plastics.







Abstract
Physical blending is an effective strategy for tailoring polymeric materials to specific application requirements. However, physically blended mixed plastics waste adds additional barriers in mechanical or chemical recycling. This difficulty arises from the intricate requirement for meticulous sorting and separation of the various polymers in the inherent incompatibility of mixed polymers during recycling. To overcome this impediment, this work furthers the emerging single&#8208;monomer &#8211; multiple&#8208;materials approach through the design of a bifunctional monomer that can not only orthogonally polymerize into two different types of polymers &#8211; specifically lactone&#8208;based polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate &#8211; but the resultant polymers and their mixture can also be depolymerized back to the single, original monomer when facilitated by catalysis. Specifically, the lactone/epoxide hybrid bifunctional monomer (BiLO) undergoes ring&#8208;opening polymerization through the lactone manifold to produce polyester, PE(BiLO), and is also applied to ring&#8208;opening copolymerization with CO2, via the epoxide manifold, to yield polycarbonate, PC(BiLO). Remarkably, a one&#8208;pot recycling process of a BiLO&#8208;derived PE/PC blend back to the constituent monomer BiLO in &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity was achieved with a superbase catalyst at 150&#8201;&#176;C, thereby effectively obviating the requirement for sorting and separation typically required for recycling of mixed polymers.

         <title>Multifunctional TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs Networks as Sulfur/Lithium Host for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs conductive network has been designed to serve as a sulfur/Li host of LSBs, whose multicomponent heterostructure facilitated maximum exposure of active sites, thereby enhancing adsorption and catalytic activity. These superior features of TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs effectively suppressed the shuttling of soluble LiPSs and accelerated their conversions, as well as expedited the nucleation/decomposition of solid Li2S and reduced uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The inevitable shuttling and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) as well as the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites have strongly limited the practical applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). To address these issues, we have innovatively constructed the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulated Co nanoparticles in situ grown on TiN&#8208;MXene nanosheets, denoted as TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs, which could serve simultaneously as both sulfur/Li host to kill &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; to (1) efficiently capture soluble LiPSs and expedite their redox conversion, (2) accelerate nucleation/decomposition of solid Li2S, and (3) induce homogeneous Li deposition. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs/S cathode with a sulfur loading of 2.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could show a high reversible specific capacity of 1129.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1&#8197;C, and ultralong cycle life over 1000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C. More importantly, it even achieves a high areal capacity of 6.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 50 cycles under a sulfur loading as high as 8.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low E/S ratio of 5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Besides, TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs as Li host could deliver a stable Li plating/striping behavior over 1000&#8197;h.

More importantly, it even achieves a high areal capacity of 6.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after 50 cycles under a sulfur loading as high as 8.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low E/S ratio of 5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides, TiN-MXene-Co@CNTs as Li host could deliver a stable Li plating/striping behavior over 1000&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Silver(I)&#8208;Containing I&#8211;Motif DNA Hybrid Catalyst for Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver(I)&#8208;containing i&#8208;motif DNA hybrid catalyst enables the catalysis of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high reactivity and excellent enantioselectivity, in which the catalytic center of copper(II) ion specifically coordinates with one nitrogen atom of adenine and two nearby phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms in the loop region.







Abstract
The inherent chiral structures of DNA serve as attractive scaffolds to construct DNA hybrid catalysts for valuable enantioselective transformations. Duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis has made great progress, yet novel design strategies of DNA hybrid catalysts are highly demanding and atomistic analysis of active centers is still challenging. DNA i&#8208;motif structures could be finely tuned by different cytosine&#8208;cytosine base pairs, providing a new platform to design DNA catalysts. Herein, we found that a human telomeric i&#8208;motif DNA containing cytosine&#8208;silver(I)&#8208;cytosine (C&#8208;Ag+&#8208;C) base pairs interacting with Cu(II) ions (i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+) could catalyze Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with full conversions and up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. As characterized by various physicochemical techniques, the presence of Ag+ is proved to replace the protons in hemiprotonated cytosine&#8208;cytosine (C&#8201;:&#8201;C+) base pairs and stabilize the DNA i&#8208;motif to allow the acceptance of Cu(II) ions. The i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+ catalyst shows about 8&#8208;fold rate acceleration compared with DNA and Cu2+. Based on DNA mutation experiments, thermodynamic studies and density function theory calculations, the catalytic center of Cu(II) ion is proposed to be located in a specific loop region via binding to one nitrogen&#8208;7 atom of an unpaired adenine and two phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms from nearby deoxythymidine monophosphate and deoxyadenosine monophosphate, respectively.

         <title>Hierarchical Solid&#8208;Additive Strategy for Achieving Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells with Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells, we use FeCl3 as a p&#8208;type dopant to enhance the hole mobility and hole concentration of the lower donor layer and polyfluorene as a wide&#8208;band gap polymer additive into the upper acceptor layer to improve the morphology and prolong exciton lifetime without affecting the open&#8208;circuit voltage. Such a hierarchical strategy achieves higher and more balanced charge mobilities and suppresses charge recombination.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition of active layers in organic solar cells (OSCs) offers immense potential for optimizing performance through precise tailoring of each layer. However, achieving high&#8208;performance LbL OSCs with distinct solid additives in each layer remains challenging. In this study, we explore a novel approach that strategically incorporates different solid additives into specific layers of LbL devices. To this end, we introduce FeCl3 into the lower donor (D18) layer as a p&#8208;type dopant to enhance hole concentration and mobility. Concurrently, we incorporate the wide&#8208;band gap conjugated polymer poly(9,9&#8208;di&#8208;n&#8208;octylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl) (PFO) into the upper acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) layer to improve the morphology and prolong exciton lifetime. Unlike previous studies, our approach combines these two strategies to achieve higher and more balanced electron and hole mobility without affecting device open&#8208;circuit voltage, while also suppressing charge recombination. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO device increases to 18.12&#8201;%, while the D18/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device attains a PCE of 18.79&#8201;%. These values represent substantial improvements over the control device&#8242;s PCE of 17.59&#8201;%. Notably, when both FeCl3 and PFO are incorporated, the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.17&#8201;%. In summary, our research results demonstrate the effectiveness of the layered solid additive strategy in improving OSC performance.

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of Ben&#8208;Zene Rings via Wheland Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of benzene rings was realized for the first time. Distinct to the meta&#8208;photocycloadditions, this reaction was proposed to proceed via [4&#960;+2&#960;] cycloadditions of Wheland intermediates from the electrophilic dearomatization of benzene rings. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions are powerful synthetic transformations utilizing aromatic compounds for cycloaddition reactions. They have been extensively applied to the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds not only because of the complexity generated from simplicity but also the atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. For the most studied yet challenging benzene ring systems, ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;cycloadditions have been realized both photochemically and thermally, while the meta&#8208;cycloadditions are still limited to the photochemical processes tracing back to the 1960s. Herein, we for the first time realized the thermal cycloadditions of benzene rings with alkenes in a meta fashion via Wheland intermediates. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA. Moreover, the reaction could be performed in gram&#8208;scales and the products could be diversely elaborated.

         <title>Multiple Stabilization Effects of Benzylhydrazine on Scalable Perovskite Precursor Inks for Improved Perovskite Solar Cell Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of stabilizing perovskite ink is proposed. This method uses benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) to stabilize the organic cations of perovskite ink, and remove harmful water impurities, while also reducing iodine back to iodide as has already been discovered. The downstream products of BHC and iodine are investigated via 1D and 2D&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and found to be chemically benign. All scalable perovskite solar cells are made with BHC ink and found to have nearly 20&#8201;% efficiency.







Abstract
Perovskite precursor inks suffer various forms of degradation, such as iodide anion oxidation and organic cation breakdown, hindering reliable perovskite solar cell manufacturing. Here we report that benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) not only retards the buildup of iodine as previously reported but also prevents the breakdown of organic cations. Through investigating BHC and iodine chemical reactions, we elucidate protonation and dehydration mechanisms, converting BHC to harmless volatile compounds, thus preserving perovskite film crystallization and solar cell performance. This inhibition effect lasts nearly a month with minimal BHC, contrasting control inks without BHC where organic cations fully react in less than a week. This enhanced understanding, from additive stabilization to end products, promises improved perovskite solar cell production reliability.

         <title>A Modular Dual&#8208;Catalytic Aryl&#8208;Chlorination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dual catalysis strategy for the modular synthesis of highly functionalized and structurally diverse 1&#8208;aryl, 2&#8208;chloroalkanes via the coupling of diaryliodonium salts, alkenes, and potassium chloride.







Abstract
Alkyl chlorides are a class of versatile building blocks widely used to generate C(sp3)&#8208;rich scaffolds through transformation such as nucleophilic substitution, radical addition reactions and metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling processes. Despite their utility in the synthesis of high&#8208;value functional molecules, distinct methods for the preparation of alkyl chlorides are underrepresented. Here, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dual catalysis strategy for the modular synthesis of highly functionalized and structurally diverse arylated chloroalkanes via the coupling of diaryliodonium salts, alkenes and potassium chloride. A distinctive aspect of this transformation is a ligand&#8208;design&#8208;driven approach for the development of a copper(II)&#8208;based atom&#8208;transfer catalyst that enables the aryl&#8208;chlorination of electron&#8208;poor alkenes, complementing its iron(III)&#8208;based counterpart that accommodates non&#8208;activated aliphatic alkenes and styrene derivatives. The complementarity of the two dual catalytic systems allows the efficient aryl&#8208;chlorination of alkenes bearing different stereo&#8208;electronic properties and a broad range of functional groups, maximizing the structural diversity of the 1&#8208;aryl, 2&#8208;chloroalkane products.

         <title>Dichloromethane as C1 Synthon for the Photoredox Catalytic Cyclopropanation of Aromatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dichloromethane, an inexpensive C1 synthon, can be used with a nickel aminopyridine complex and iridium photocatalyst dual system to efficiently cyclopropanate aromatic olefins under mild conditions. This versatile methodology enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies highlight the role of the reduced nickel complex, facilitating homolytic Csp3&#8722;Cl bond cleavage and chloromethyl radical formation, captured by olefins.







Abstract
Dichloromethane, as a readily available and inexpensive C1 synthon is proposed as a powerful building block for cyclopropanation of alkenes under mild conditions. Herein, we report a highly efficient and versatile dual photoredox system, involving a nickel aminopyridine coordination complex and a photocatalyst, for the cyclopropanation of aromatic olefins using dichloromethane, under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The cyclopropanation protocol has been successfully applied at gram scale. Mechanistic studies suggest a Ni(II) pyridyl radical complex as the key intermediate for the homolytic cleavage of the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond, generating a chloromethyl radical that is captured by the olefin coupling partner. Our findings also highlight the versatility of this methodology. By directing the radical/polar crossover process, we were able to selectively drive the reaction towards either the formation of cyclopropyl derivatives or the corresponding non&#8208;cyclic alkyl chloride products. The methodology also successfully apply to geminal dichloroalkanes, including the formation of spiro[2,2] compounds. Moreover, our methodology extends to the synthesis of deuterium&#8208;labelled cyclopropanes, demonstrating its utility in isotopic labelling and broadening its applicability in chemical synthesis and drug development.

         <title>Elevating Discharge Voltage of Li2CO3&#8208;Routine Li&#8722;CO2 Battery over 2.9&#8197;V at an Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li&#8722;CO2 battery with a configuration of Li/LiTFSI&#8208;TEGDME&#8208;CoPc/Mo2C exhibits prominent temperature adaptability (&#8722;30&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical stability (1600&#8197;hours), and especially a higher discharge voltage of 2.98&#8197;V than the theoretical value (2.8&#8197;V). CoPc adsorbs CO2 to form an intermediate C33H16CoN8O2, and the reduction potential of intermediate C33H16CoN8O2 is higher than 2.8&#8197;V. This is the main reason why Li&#8722;CO2 battery has an ultra&#8208;high discharge platform.







Abstract
The Li&#8722;CO2 batteries utilizing greenhouse gas CO2 possess advantages of high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, these batteries following Li2CO3&#8208;product route typically exhibit low work voltage (&lt;2.5&#8197;V) and energy efficiency. Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as homogeneous catalyst can elevate the work plateau towards 2.98&#8197;V, which is higher than its theoretical discharge voltage without changing the Li2CO3&#8208;product route. This unprecedented discharge voltage is illustrated by mass spectrum and electrochemical analyses that CoPc has powerful adsorption capability with CO2 (&#8722;7.484&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and forms discharge intermediate of C33H16CoN8O2. Besides high discharge capacity of 18724&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and robust cyclability over 1600&#8197;hours (1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 cut&#8208;off) at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the batteries show high temperature adaptability (&#8722;30&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C). Our work is paving a promising avenue for the progress of high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Bimetallic Single Atom/Nanoparticle Ensemble for Efficient Photochemical Cascade Synthesis of Ethylene from Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. The synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis presents a promising approach for the activation and conversion of methane (CH4) into high value&#8208;added chemicals under ambient conditions. However, the high C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy of CH4 and the absence of well&#8208;defined C&#8722;H activation sites on catalysts significantly limit the highly efficient conversion of CH4 toward multicarbon (C2+) hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene (C2H4). Herein, we demonstrate a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade conversion of CH4 into C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs, upon effecting key bond&#8208;breaking and &#8208;forming events, lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation. This work offers a novel perspective on the advancement of photocatalytic directional CH4 conversion toward high value&#8208;added C2+ hydrocarbons through the subtle design of bimetallic cascade catalyst strategy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rapidly growing interest in organic bioelectronic applications has spurred the development of a wide variety of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. While these new mixed conductors have enabled the community to interface organic electronics with biological systems and efficiently transduce biological signals (ions) into electronic signals, the current materials selection does not offer sufficient selectivity towards specific ions of biological relevance without the use of auxiliary components such as ion&#8208;selective membranes. Here, we present the molecular design of an n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) perylene diimide semiconductor material decorated with pendant oligoether groups to facilitate interactions with cations such as Na+ and K+. Using the cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 oligoether motif, we find that the resulting mixed conductor PDI&#8208;crown displays a strong dependence on the size of the electrolyte cation when tested in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration. In stark contrast to the low current response on the order of 1 &#181;A observed with aqueous sodium chloride, a nearly 200&#8208;fold increase in current is observed with aqueous potassium chloride. We ascribe the high selectivity to extended molecular aggregation and therefore efficient charge transport in the presence of K+ due to a favourable sandwich&#8208;like structure between two adjacent 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 motifs and the potassium ion.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27 kJ mol&#8722;1&#160;in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6 kJ mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies ranged from &#8722;0.02 kJ mol&#8722;1&#160;&#197;&#8722;2&#160;in CS2, to &#8722;0.05 kJ mol&#8722;1&#160;&#197;&#8722;2&#160;in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6 kJ mol&#8722;1&#160;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis, crystal, and electronic structure, as well as the magnetic, and electric properties of the phosphorus&#8208;containing tantalum nitride P1&#8211;xTa8+xN13 (x = 0.1&#8211;0.15). A high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction (8 GPa, 1400 &#176;C) of Ta3N5 and P3N5 with NH4F as a mineralizing agent yields the compound in the form of black, rod&#8208;shaped crystals. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure elucidation (space group C2/m (no. 12), a = 16.202(3), b = 2.9155(4), c = 11.089(2)&#160;&#197;, &#946; = 126.698(7)&#176;, Z = 2) shows a network of face&#8208; and edge&#8208;sharing Ta&#8208;centered polyhedra that contains small vacant channels and&#160; PN6 octahedra strands. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals an unusual P/Ta disorder. Mixed&#8208;valent tantalum atoms exhibit interatomic distances similar to those in metallic tantalum, however, the electrical resistivity is quite high in the order of 10&#8209;1&#160;&#937;&#160;cm. The density of states and the electron localization function indicate localized electrons in both covalent and ionic bonds between P/Ta and N atoms, combined with less localized electrons that do not contribute to interatomic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen&#160;Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+&#160;metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal&#160;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+&#160;metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (alpha) anomeric configuration as preferred by the&#160;A. tumefaciens&#160;enzyme (beta). Findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in bacteria.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one&#8208;handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one&#8208;pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry. The carboxy&#8208;bound helicity&#8208;memorized polymer self&#8208;assembles into a cholesteric liquid crystal in concentrated water, in which a variety of basic achiral fluorophores further co&#8208;assembles to form supramolecular helical aggregates that exhibit an induced circularly polarized luminescence in a color tunable manner.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8211;RR) is an important route for sustainable NH3 synthesis and environmental remediation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one family of promising NO3&#8211;RR electrocatalysts, however,&#160;there is plenty of room to improve in their performance, calling for new design principles. Herein, a MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is fabricated for efficient NO3&#8211;RR to NH3 production. By growing Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanorods on Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) nanosheets, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the formation of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Co bonds at the interface of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure, leading to dual active sites tailed for NO3&#8211;RR. The Ni sites facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8211;, while the Co sites boost the H2O decomposition to supply active hydrogen (Hads) for N&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation on adjacent Ni sites, cooperatively reducing the energy barriers of NO3&#8211;RR process. Together with the accelerated electron transfer enabled by built&#8208;in electric field, remarkable NO3&#8211;RR performance is achieved with an NH3 yield rate of 11.46&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Formulating Self&#8208;repairing Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dynamic Electric Double Layer for Practical Zinc ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) encounter interface issues stemming from the water&#8208;rich electrical double layer (EDL) and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose the dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing hybrid SEI for practical ZIBs via incorporating the horizontally&#8208;oriented dual&#8208;site additive. The rearrangement of distribution and molecular configuration of additive constructs the robust dynamic EDL under different interface charges. And, a self&#8208;repairing organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI is constructed via the electrochemical decomposition of additive. The dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing SEI accelerate interfacial kinetics, regulate deposition and suppress side reactions in the both stripping and plating during long&#8208;term cycles, which affords high reversibility for 500 h at 42.7% depth of discharge or 50 mA&#183;cm&#8208;1. Remarkably, Zn//NVO full cells deliver the impressive cycling stability for 10000 cycles with 100% capacity retention at 3 A&#183;g&#8208;1 and for over 3000 cycles even at lean electrolyte (7.5 &#956;L&#183;mAh&#8208;1) and high loading (15.26 mg&#183;cm&#8208;2). Moreover, effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated in the low&#8208;temperature full cell (&#8208;30 oC).</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating Formate Selectivity via Optimizing eg* Band Broadening in NiMn Hydroxides for Ethylene Glycol Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (EGOR) on nickel&#8208;based hydroxides (Ni(OH)2) represents a promising strategy for generating value&#8208;added chemicals, i.e. formate and glycolate, and coupling water&#8208;electrolytic hydrogen production. The high product selectivity was one of the most significant area of polyols electro&#8208;oxidation process. Yet, developing Ni(OH)2&#8208;based EGOR electrocatalyst with highly selective product remains a challenge due to the unclear cognition about the EGOR mechanism. Herein, Mn&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 catalysts were utilized to investigate the EGOR mechanism. Experimental and calculation results reveal that the electronic states of eg* band play an important role in the catalytic performance and the product selectivity for EGOR. Broadening the eg* band could effectively enhance the adsorption capacity of glyoxal intermediates. On the other hand, this enhanced adsorption could lead to reduced side reactions associated with glycolate formation, simultaneously promoting the cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds. Consequently, the selectivity for formate was notably augmented by these enhancements. This work offers new insights into the regulation of catalyst electronic states for improving polyol electrocatalytic activity and product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Insulator&#8208;transition&#8208;induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d due to its inner &#178;perfecting&#178; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg'2&#173;&#173;a1g&#173;1&#160;eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg'4a1g&#173;2 eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8208;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Complex Chemistry and Degradation of Ascorbic Acid in Aqueous Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ascorbic acid (AA) is the most widely used reductant for noble metal nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post&#8208;synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully&#8208;aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of Au nanorods. Our findings have important implications for achieving monodispersed products in the many metal NP synthesis reactions that make use of AA as a reducing agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Alkene Atropisomers with Multiple Stereogenic Elements via Catalytic Asymmetric Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Indolylmethanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective preparation of alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements and discovery of their applications have become significant but challenging issues in the scientific community due to the unique structures of this class of atropisomers. We herein report the first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles, a new kind of alkene atropisomers, with stereogenic point and axial chirality via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols under asymmetric organocatalysis. Notably, this novel type of alkene atropisomers have promising applications in developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts, discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Moreover, the theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction mechanism and the non&#8208;covalent interactions to control the enantioselectivity. This approach offers a new synthetic strategy for alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements, and represents the first catalytic enantioselective rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols, which will advance the chemistry of atropisomers and chiral indole chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The direct production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through photocatalytic reaction via H2O and O2 is considered as an ideal approach. However, the efficiency of H2O2 generation is generally limited by insufficient charge and mass transfer. Covalent organic framework (COFs) offer a promising platform as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for H2O2&#160;production due to their potential for rational design at the molecular level. Herein, we integrated the multipolar structures and carboxyl groups into COFs to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water without any sacrificial agents. The introduction of octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with an increase of molecular planarity, created efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Meanwhile, carboxyl groups could not only boost O2 and H2O2 movement via enhancement of pore hydrophilicity, but also promote proton conduction, enabling the conversion to H2O2 from &#183;O2&#8208;, which is the crucial intermediate product in H2O2 photocatalysis. Overall, we demonstrate that TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH, consisting of optimal octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with enrichment sites (carboxyl groups), exhibited a H2O2 yield rate of 3542 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (SCC) efficiency of 0.55%. This work provides valuable insights for designing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Gradient Desodiation Chemistry in Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra&#8208;stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg) cathode material in which a Mg&#8208;free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg&#8208;hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered&#8208;to&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high&#8208;valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The as&#8208;prepared NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000 cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127 mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Assembly of Acridines by Integrating Photo&#8208;Excitation of o&#8208;Alkyl&#160;Nitroarenes&#160;with Copper&#8208;Promoted Cascade Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acridine frameworks stand as pivotal architectural elements in pharmaceuticals and photocatalytic applications, owing to their chemical adaptability, biological activity, and unique excited&#8208;state dynamics. Conventional synthetic routes often entail specialized starting materials, anaerobic or moisture&#8208;free conditions, and elaborate multi&#8208;stage manipulations for incorporating diverse functionalities. Herein, we present a convergent approach integrating photo&#8208;excitation of readily available ortho&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with copper&#8208;promoted cascade annulation. This innovative system enables an aerobic, one&#8208;pot reaction of o&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with arylboronic acids, thereby streamlining the modular construction of a wide array of acridine dervatives with various functional groups. This encompasses symmetrical, unsymmetrical and polysubstituted varieties, some of which are otherwise exceptionally difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, it significantly improves the production of structurally varied acridinium salts, featuring enhanced photophysical properties, high excited state potentials (E*red = 2.08&#8722;3.15 V), and exhibiting superior performance in intricate photoredox transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unlikely Occurring Quadrangular Tube by Modulating Intramolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the central focuses in self&#8208;assembly is precisely controlling the self&#8208;assembly pathway so that the target molecules can be produced exclusively. Trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine contains two amino units that form a 60&#176; angle when projected on a plane. This angle naturally favors the formation of triangular products in most cases when trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine is used as a bisamino building block in the synthesis of macrocycles and tubes. Here, we synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor bearing a central dibenzothiophene moiety, whose 3,7&#8208;positions are functionalized with two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. We observed that combining this tetraformyl building block with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine yielded a quadrangular tube when the concentrations of the precursors were relatively high. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of this unlikely occurring quadrangular product was driven by the intramolecular C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the dibenzothiophene building blocks within the tube framework. This driving force, however, was disturbed in the triangular tube, a smaller counterpart whose formation was considered previously much more thermodynamically favored. These results improved our fundamental understanding on how to create those products whose syntheses are considered difficult or impossible, by modulating the intramolecular driving forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical application is hindered by zinc anode limitations. We introduce diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive to address these challenges. DTPA&#8208;Na's unique dual functionality enables the formation of robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the zinc anode and stable cathode electrolyte interphases (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits dendrite growth, leading to exceptional cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition. Asymmetrical cells employing DTPA&#8208;Na achieve an unprecedented 32,000 cycles at a high charging rate of 50 mA/cm2, while symmetric cells demonstrate a lifespan of 160 hours with 95% zinc utilization. Full Zn||MnOOH cells exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining 98.61% capacity retention after 720 hours of self&#8208;discharge and negligible capacity decay over 5000 cycles. Our work highlights the transformative potential of DTPA&#8208;Na as a dual&#8208;functional electrolyte additive, paving the way for high&#8208;performance ZIBs for practical energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of 1&#8208;Octene with [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the quantitative electro&#8208;hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes with H2O in neutral or even alkaline conditions. Electro&#8208;hydrogenation is typically driven by H+ reduction in acidic media to generate reactive metal&#8208;hydrides, which then either hydrogenate or react with H+ to liberate H2 in a parasitic process. Our work shows that H2 evolution can be suppressed by forming metal&#8208;hydrides via oxidative addition of H2O instead of H+ reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene as non&#8208;activated model substrate with neutral water as H&#8208;donor is reported, using [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] (1) as the catalyst, to form octane with high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96&#8201;% and a kobs of 87&#8197;s&#8722;1. Cyclic voltammetry with 1 revealed that two subsequent reductions trigger the elimination of Cl&#8722; and afford the highly reactive anionic Ir(I) hydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)]&#8722; (2), a previously merely proposed intermediate for which we now report first experimental data by mass spectrometry. In absence of alkene, the stoichiometric electrolysis of 1 in THF with water selectively affords the Ir(III) dihydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)2] (3) in 88&#8201;% FE from the reaction of 2 with H2O. Complex 3 then hydrogenates the alkene in classical fashion. The presented electro&#8208;hydrogenation works with extremely high FE, because the iridium hydrides are water stable, which prevents H2 formation. Even in strongly alkaline conditions (Bu4NOH added), the electro&#8208;hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene with 1 also proceeds cleanly (89&#8201;% FE), suggesting a highly robust process that may rely on H2O activation, reminiscent to transfer hydrogenation pathways, instead of classical H+ reduction. DFT calculations confirmed oxidative addition of H2O as a key step in this context.

   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;/sup&gt;PCP)Ir(H)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), a previously merely proposed intermediate for which we now report first experimental data by mass spectrometry. In absence of alkene, the stoichiometric electrolysis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in THF with water selectively affords the Ir(III) dihydride complex [(&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;/sup&gt;PCP)Ir(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) in 88&#8201;% FE from the reaction of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; then hydrogenates the alkene in classical fashion. The presented electro-hydrogenation works with extremely high FE, because the iridium hydrides are water stable, which prevents H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation. Even in strongly alkaline conditions (Bu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NOH added), the electro-hydrogenation of 1-octene with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; also proceeds cleanly (89&#8201;% FE), suggesting a highly robust process that may rely on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O activation, reminiscent to transfer hydrogenation pathways, instead of classical H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. DFT calculations confirmed oxidative addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a key step in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Delivery of Carbon Disulfide in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system has been developed for cell platform applications, and it is found that the hepatoxicity caused by CS2 is related to oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death.







Abstract
Carbon disulfide (CS2) is an environmental contaminant, which is deadly hazardous to the workers under chronic or acute exposure. However, the toxicity mechanisms of CS2 are still unclear due to the scarcity of biocompatible donors, which can release CS2 in cells. Here we developed the first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system based on the &#8220;click&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; reactions between mesoionic 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;5&#8208;thiolates (TATs) and strained cyclooctyne exo&#8208;BCN&#8208;OH. We successfully realized intracellular CS2 release and investigated the causes of CS2&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, including oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death. It is found that CS2 can be copper vehicles bypassing copper transporters after reacting with nucleophiles in cytoplasm, and extra copper supplementation will exacerbate the loss of homeostasis of cells and ultimately cell death. These findings inspired us to explore the anticancer activity of CS2 in combination with copper by introducing a copper chelating group in our CS2 delivery system.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Supported 2&#8208;Sila and 2&#8208;Germavinylidenes: Synthesis, Dynamics, First Reactivity and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;supported 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes 1&#8208;E were prepared by a C(NHC) transfer reaction of the diazoolefin (NHC)CN2 with (E)&#8208;(Tbb)BrE=EBr(Tbb). Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal an interesting electronic structure of the 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes 1&#8208;E, which display stereodynamics in solution and undergo an 1,2&#8208;addition reaction with GeBr2(1,4&#8208;dioxane) across the E=C multiple bonds forming NHC&#8208;supported bromogermynes 2&#8208;EGe.







Abstract
2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (C=EH2; E=Si, Ge) are according to quantum chemical studies the least stable isomers on the [E,C,2H] potential energy hypersurface isomerizing easily via the trans&#8208;bent tetrelaacetylenes HE&#8801;CH to the thermodynamically most stable 1&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (E=CH2). Consequently, experimental studies on 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (C=ER2) and their derivatives are lacking. Herein we report experimental and theoretical studies of the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) supported 2&#8208;silavinylidene (NHC)C=SiBr(Tbb) (1&#8208;Si: NHC=C[N(Dipp)CH]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Tbb=2,6&#8208;bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) and the isovalent 2&#8208;germavinylidenes (NHC)C=GeBr(R) (1&#8208;Ge, 1&#8208;GeMind: R=Tbb, Mind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7&#8208;octamethyl&#8208;s&#8208;hydrindacene&#8208;4&#8208;yl)). The NHC&#8208;supported 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes were obtained selectively from the 1,2&#8208;dibromoditetrelenes (E)&#8208;(R)BrE=EBr(R) using the diazoolefin (NHC)CN2 as vinylidene transfer reagent. 1&#8208;E (E=Si, Ge) have a planar vinylidene core, a bent&#8208;dicoordinated vinylidene carbon atom (CVNL), a very short E=CVNL bond and an almost orthogonal orientation of the NHC five&#8208;membered ring to the vinylidene core. Quantum chemical analysis of the electronic structures of 1&#8208;E suggest a significantly bent 1&#8208;tetrelaallene and tetrelyne character. NMR studies shed light into the dynamics of 1&#8208;E involving NHC&#8208;rotation around the CVNL&#8722;CNHC bond with a low activation barrier. Furthermore, the synthetic potential of 1&#8208;E is demonstrated by the synthesis and full characterization of the unprecedented NHC&#8208;supported bromogermynes BrGe=C(EBr2Tbb)(NHC) (2&#8208;SiGe: E=Si; 2&#8208;GeGe: E=Ge).

         <title>Potent Immunomodulators Developed from an Unstable Bacterial Metabolite of Vitamin B2 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient bacterial metabolite that potently activates T lymphocytes called MAIT cells is too unstable in water to fully exploit in biology. Here, we describe highly stable and extremely potent new immunostimulants, immunosuppressants, and probes that shed new light on the mechanism of MAIT cell activation. These new chemical tools offer fresh insights for designing novel vaccines, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anti&#8208;infective drugs.







Abstract
Bacterial synthesis of vitamin B2 generates a by&#8208;product, 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;d&#8208;ribityl&#8208;aminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), with potent immunological properties in mammals, but it is rapidly degraded in water. This natural product covalently bonds to the key immunological protein MR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling MR1 refolding and trafficking to the cell surface, where it interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on mucosal associated invariant T lymphocytes (MAIT cells), activating their immunological and antimicrobial properties. Here, we strategically modify this natural product to understand the molecular basis of its recognition by MR1. This culminated in the discovery of new water&#8208;stable compounds with extremely powerful and distinctive immunological functions. We report their capacity to bind MR1 inside APCs, triggering its expression on the cell surface (EC50 17&#8197;nM), and their potent activation (EC50 56&#8197;pM) or inhibition (IC50 80&#8197;nM) of interacting MAIT cells. We further derivatize compounds with diazirine&#8208;alkyne, biotin, or fluorophore (Cy5 or AF647) labels for detecting, monitoring, and studying cellular MR1. Computer modeling casts new light on the molecular mechanism of activation, revealing that potent activators are first captured in a tyrosine&#8208; and serine&#8208;lined cleft in MR1 via specific pi&#8208;interactions and H&#8208;bonds, before more tightly attaching via a covalent bond to Lys43 in MR1. This chemical study advances our molecular understanding of how bacterial metabolites are captured by MR1, influence cell surface expression of MR1, interact with T cells to induce immunity, and offers novel clues for developing new vaccine adjuvants, immunotherapeutics, and anticancer drugs.

         <title>Catalytic (4+2) Annulation via Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Interception of in&#8208;situ Generated Alkylgold Intermediate</title>

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished under gold&#8208;complex and chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide synergetic catalysis, providing chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans with high efficiency and selectivity. This method complements the (4+2) annulation of allene reagents via a formal cycloaddition on internal &#960;&#8208;bond, which is challenging and remains elusive.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective stepwise (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished with synergetic catalysis by a combination of a gold&#8208;complex and a chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide (QN&#8208;SQA), leading to highly functionalized chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans in good to high yields with generally excellent enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the in situ formed alkylgold species is the key intermediate in this transformation, and the amide group served as a traceless directing group in this highly selective transformation. This method complements the enantioselective (4+2) annulation of allene reagents, providing the formal internal C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bond cycloaddition products, which is challenging and remains elusive.

         <title>Engineering Low Volume Resuscitants for the Prehospital Care of Severe Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traumatic injury is a leading cause of global suffering and death. We rationally design polymeric, low volume resuscitants (LVRs) for the prehospital treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock. By varying polymer architecture, Rg, and composition to influence resuscitation, coagulation, and biodistribution, we developed a radiant star polymer that is non&#8208;coagulopathic and corrects 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable LVR has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.







Abstract
Globally, traumatic injury is a leading cause of suffering and death. The ability to curtail damage and ensure survival after major injury requires a time&#8208;sensitive response balancing organ perfusion, blood loss, and portability, underscoring the need for novel therapies for the prehospital environment. Currently, there are few options available for damage control resuscitation (DCR) of trauma victims. We hypothesize that synthetic polymers, which are tunable, portable, and stable under austere conditions, can be developed as effective injectable therapies for trauma medicine. In this work, we design injectable polymers for use as low volume resuscitants (LVRs). Using RAFT polymerization, we evaluate the effect of polymer size, architecture, and chemical composition upon both blood coagulation and resuscitation in a rat hemorrhagic shock model. Our therapy is evaluated against a clinically used colloid resuscitant, Hextend. We demonstrate that a radiant star poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) polymer did not interfere with coagulation while successfully correcting metabolic deficit and resuscitating animals from hemorrhagic shock to the desired mean arterial pressure range for DCR &#8211; correcting a 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable and non&#8208;coagulopathic resuscitant has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.

         <title>Alumina &#8211; Stabilized SEI and CEI in Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin film (10&#8197;&#956;m) of alumina (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated on both sides of commercial polypropene separators, then transferred onto both anode and cathode surfaces during cell assembly. This creates both artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) that enhance electrochemical kinetics of potassium metal batteries (KMBs).







Abstract
Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated onto both sides of commercial polypropene separator to create artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and artificial cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) in potassium metal batteries (KMBs). This significantly enhances the stability, including of KMBs with Prussian Blue (PB) cathodes. For example, symmetric cells are stable after 1,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2 and 3.0&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2. Alumina modified separators promote electrolyte wetting and increase ionic conductivity (0.59 vs. 0.2&#8197;mS/cm) and transference number (0.81 vs. 0.23). Cryo&#8208;stage focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) analysis of cycled modified anode demonstrates dense and planar electrodeposits, versus unmodified baseline consisting of metal filaments (dendrites) interspersed with pores and SEI. Alumina&#8208;modified CEI also suppresses elemental Fe crossover and reduces cathode cracking. Mesoscale modeling of metal &#8211; SEI interactions captures crucial role of intrinsic heterogeneities, illustrating how artificial SEI affects reaction current distribution, conductivity and morphological stability.

         <title>Orthogonal Radical and Cationic Single&#8208;Unit Monomer Insertions for Engineering Polymer Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing the monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and making necessary adjustments to the reaction conditions, we have successfully developed the orthogonal single&#8208;unit monomer insertions (SUMIs) technique. This technique allows for the simultaneous implementation of radical and cationic SUMI reactions in a single reaction vessel without any mutual interference.







Abstract
The single&#8208;unit monomer insertion (SUMI), derived from living/controlled polymerization, can be directly functionalized at the end or within the chain of polymers prepared by living/controlled polymerization, offering potential applications in the preparation of polymers with complex architectures. Many scenarios demand the simultaneous incorporation of monomers suitable for different polymerization methods into complex polymers. Therefore, it becomes imperative to utilize SUMI technologies with diverse mechanisms, especially those that are compatible with each other. Here, we reported the orthogonal SUMI technique, seamlessly combining radical and cationic SUMI approaches. Through the careful optimization of monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and adjustments to reaction conditions, we can efficiently execute both radical and cationic SUMI processes in one pot without mutual interference. The utilization of orthogonal SUMI pairs facilitates the integration of radical and cationic reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various configurations. This flexibility enables the synthesis of diblock, triblock, and star polymers that incorporate both cationically and radically polymerizable monomers. Moreover, we have successfully implemented a mixing mechanism of free radicals and cations in RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization, resulting in the creation of a side&#8208;chain sequence&#8208;controlled polymer brushes.

         <title>A Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Amidination of Lysine Residues That Retains the Protein's Positive Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine and nitrile groups efficiently enable lysine&#8208;selective amidination of peptides and proteins. The amidine products retain a positive charge at the modified sites and allow the charge&#8208;related properties to be preserved, such as the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and the interaction with negatively charged DNA to form protein&#8208;DNA fibres. The amidine products can undergo multi&#8208;site secondary modifications.







Abstract
Lysine&#8208;specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge&#8208;related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge&#8208;related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge&#8208;related protein properties, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine&#8208;containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.

&lt;p&gt;Lysine-specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge-related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge-related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge-related protein properties, such as liquid-liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;-synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine-containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spirobifluorene Trimers: High Triplet Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of extended pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials with a high triplet energy, a wide HOMO/LUMO gap and improved thermal properties compared to reported PHCs have been constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. When used as the host in blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24&#8201;% with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off was reached.







Abstract
Pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHCs) represent a new generation of host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), free of heteroatoms. They reduce the molecular complexity, can be easily synthesized and are an important direction towards robust devices. As heteroatoms can be involved in bonds dissociations in operating OLEDs through exciton induced degradation processes, developing novel PHCs appear particularly relevant for the future of this technology. In the present work, we report a series of extended PHCs constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. The resulting positional isomers present a high triplet energy level, a wide HOMO/LUMO difference and improved thermal and morphological properties compared to previously reported PHCs. These characteristics are beneficial for the next generation of host materials for PhOLEDs and provide relevant design guidelines. When used as a host in blue&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs, which are still the weakest link of the field, a very high EQE of 24&#8201;% and low threshold voltage of 3.56&#8197;V were obtained with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off. This high performance strengthens the position of PHC strategy as an efficient alternative for OLED technology and opens the way to a more simple electronic.

         <title>Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonding Networks Stabilized Organic Supramolecular Cathode for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity and Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic cathode BQQPH with multiple active sites is developed for high&#8208;performance rechargeable Al batteries. The six C=O and six C=N groups in BQQPH enables a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions within BQQPH enable robust structural stability and minimal solubility, yielding an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage, attributing to the abundant reserves, low cost, intrinsic safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, the cathode materials reported thus far still face challenges such as limited capacity, sluggish kinetics, and undesirable cycle life. Herein, we propose an organic cathode benzo[i] benzo[6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a] benzo [6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;5,8,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaone (BQQPH) for RABs. The six C=O and six C=N redox active sites in each molecule enable BQQPH to deliver a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Encouragingly, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions endow BQQPH with robust structural stability and minimal solubility, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl group induces a reduction in the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which considerably enhances both the discharge voltage and redox kinetics of BQQPH. In situ and ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations unveil that the charge storage mechanism is reversible coordination/dissociation of AlCl2+ with the N and O sites in BQQPH accompanied by 12&#8208;electron transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials for RABs.

         <title>A Systematic Study of Methyl Carbodithioate Esters as Effective Gold Contact Groups for Single&#8208;Molecule Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Carbodithioate ester&#8208;containing molecular wires have been synthesized and characterized to demonstrate the functionality as a great contact group for molecular electronics with good all&#8208;around properties including strong surface binding and high conductance. Raman, XPS and theoretical calculations support the STM&#8208;BJ conductance data and rationalize the binding groups&#8217; performance through a strong C=S to Au interaction.







Abstract
There are several binding groups used within molecular electronics for anchoring molecules to metal electrodes (e.g., R&#8722;SMe, R&#8722;NH2, R&#8722;CS2&#8722;, R&#8722;S&#8722;). However, some anchoring groups that bind strongly to electrodes have poor/unknown stability, some have weak electrode coupling, while for some their binding motifs are not well defined. Further binding groups are required to aid molecular design and to achieve a suitable balance in performance across a range of properties. We present an in&#8208;depth investigation into the use of carbodithioate esters as contact groups for single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, using scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction measurements (STM&#8208;BJ) and detailed surface spectroscopic analysis. We demonstrate that the methyl carbodithioate ester acts as an effective contact for gold electrodes in STM&#8208;BJ measurements. Surface enhanced Raman measurements demonstrate that the C=S functionality remains intact when adsorbed on to gold nanoparticles. A gold(I) complex was also synthesised showing a stable C=S&#8594;AuI interaction from the ester. Comparison with a benzyl thiomethyl ether demonstrates that the C=S moiety significantly contributes to charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions. The overall performance of the CS2Me group demonstrates it should be used more extensively and has strong potential for the fabrication of larger area devices with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Macrocycle for Efficient Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins, DNA, and CRISPR Cas9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cell penetrating macrocycle (CPM) with flexible amine linkages and amphiphilic nature assembles into a micellar&#8208;like structure that can passively permeate through the cell membrane. CPM can efficiently transfer fully functioning proteins and genetic materials into the cytosol, independent of size, charge, or complexity.







Abstract
The discovery of safe platforms that can circumvent the endocytic pathway is of great significance for biological therapeutics that are usually degraded during endocytosis. Here we show that a self&#8208;assembled and dynamic macrocycle can passively diffuse through the cell membrane and deliver a broad range of biologics, including proteins, CRISPR Cas9, and ssDNA, directly to the cytosol while retaining their bioactivity. Cell&#8208;penetrating macrocycle CPM can be easily prepared from the room temperature condensation of diketopyrrolopyrrole lactams with diamines. We attribute the high cellular permeability of CPM to its amphiphilic nature and chameleonic properties. It adopts conformations that partially bury polar groups and expose hydrophobic side chains, thus self&#8208;assembling into micellar&#8208;like structures. Its superior fluorescence makes CPM trackable inside cells where it follows the endomembrane system. CPM outperformed commercial reagents for biologics delivery and showed high RNA knockdown efficiency of CRISPR Cas9. We envisage that this macrocycle will be an ideal starting point to design and synthesize biomimetic macrocyclic tags that can readily facilitate the interaction and uptake of biomolecules and overcome endosomal digestion.

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Framework Featuring Interactive Pockets for Bromine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine, a useful, although toxic halogen can coexist with I2 in an equilibrium product of IBr. Here, we propose a new Covalent Organic Framework (COF) featuring triple bonds, an electron&#8208;rich pyrene unit, and heteroatoms (N sites) to selectively capture Br2 over I2. The participation of the triple bond can be classified as a combined physisorption as well as chemisorption process, giving rise to a unique method for the capture of Br2.







Abstract
The high degree of corrosivity and reactivity of bromine, which is released from various sources, poses a serious threat to the environment. Moreover, its coexistence with iodine forming an equilibrium compound, iodine monobromide (IBr) necessitates the selective capture of bromine from halogen mixtures. The electrophilicity of halogens to &#960;&#8208;electron rich structures enabled us to strategically design a covalent organic framework for halogen capture, featuring a defined pore environment with localized sorption sites. The higher capture capacity of bromine (4.6&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) over iodine by ~41&#8201;% shows its potential in selective capture. Spectroscopic results uncovering the preferential interaction sites are supported by theoretical investigations. The alkyne bridge is a core functionality promoting the selectivity in capture by synergistic physisorption, rationalized by the higher orbital overlap of bromine due to its smaller atomic size as well as reversible chemical interactions. The slip stacking in the structure has further promoted this phenomenon by creating clusters of molecular interaction sites with bromine intercalated between the layers. The inclusion of unsaturated moieties, i.e. triple bonds and the complementary pore geometry offer a promising design strategy for the construction of porous materials for halogen capture.

         <title>Carboxylesterase Activatable Molecular Probe for Personalized Treatment Guidance by Analyte&#8208;Induced Molecular Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>

A near&#8208;infrared fluorescence/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode molecular probe with high specificity and responsiveness of carboxylesterase was developed through the analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation strategy.







Abstract
Accurate visualization of tumor microenvironment is of great significance for personalized medicine. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) dual&#8208;mode molecular probe (denoted as NIR&#8722;CE) for distinguishing tumors based on carboxylesterase (CE) level by an analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation (AIMT) strategy. The recognition moiety for CE activity is the acetyl unit of NIR&#8722;CE, generating the pre&#8208;product, NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;OH, which undergoes spontaneous hydrogen atom exchange between the nitrogen atoms in the indole group and the phenol hydroxyl group, eventually transforming into NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;H. In cellular experiments and in vivo blind studies, the human hepatoma cells and tumors with high level of CE were successfully distinguished by both NIR FL and PA imaging. Our findings provide a new molecular imaging strategy for personalized treatment guidance.

         <title>An Enzymatic Prodrug&#8208;like Route to Thio and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic route to thioamides was elucidated as part of the biosynthesis of the antimetabolite 6&#8208;thioguanine in plant&#8208;pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, an adenylating enzyme forms an intermediate cysteine&#8208;S&#8208;conjugate that is cleaved by a designated C&#8722;S lyase, a process that mirrors a prodrug approach in cancer therapy.







Abstract
6&#8208;Thioguanine (6TG) is a clinically used antitumor agent that was rationally designed as a DNA&#8208;targeting antimetabolite, but it also occurs naturally. 6TG is a critical virulence factor produced by Erwinia amylovorans, a notorious plant pathogen that causes fire blight of pome fruit trees. The biosynthesis of the rare thioamide metabolite involves an adenylating enzyme (YcfA) and a sulfur&#8208;mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), but the mechanism of sulfur transfer and putative intermediates have remained elusive. Through dissection and in vitro reconstitution of the thionation process using diverse substrates, we uncover an intermediate, prodrug&#8208;like thio&#8208;conjugate and elucidate the precise enzyme functions. YcfA not only adenylates GMP but also transfers the mercapto group of l&#8208;cysteine to the activated carbonyl. A designated C&#8722;S lyase (YcfC) then cleaves the resulting S&#8208;adduct to yield the thioamide. This pathway is distinct from canonical tRNA sulfur modifications and known enzymatic peptide thionations. By exploring a wide range of substrate surrogates, we exploited the tolerance of the enzyme pair to produce even a seleno analog. This study provides valuable insight into a previously unexplored area of bacterial thioamide formation and lays the groundwork for synthetic biology approaches to produce thioamide antimetabolites.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Control in Dysprosium(III) Metallacrown Magnets via Thioacetal Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thioacetal modification, a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown with a square planar NiII successfully realized chemical&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) and the spin state of NiII altering from low&#8208;spin S=0 to high&#8208;spin S=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics.







Abstract
Integrating controllable spin states into single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) enables precise manipulation of magnetic interactions at a molecular level, but remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we developed a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown (MC) magnet [DyNi5(quinha)5(Clsal)2(py)8](ClO4)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (H2quinha=quinaldichydroxamic acid, HClsal=5&#8208;chlorosalicylaldehyde) wherein a square planar NiII is stabilized by chemical stacking. Thioacetal modification was employed via post&#8208;synthetic ligand substitutions and yielded [DyNi5(quinha)5(Clsaldt)2(py)8](ClO4)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (HClsaldt=4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol). Thanks to the additional ligations of thioacetal onto the NiII site, coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) took place with spin state altering from low&#8208;spin S=0 to high&#8208;spin S=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics. Magnetic studies indicate prominent enhancement of reversal barrier from 57&#8197;cm&#8722;1 to 423&#8197;cm&#8722;1, along with hysteresis opening and an over 200&#8208;fold increment in coercive field at 2&#8197;K. Ab initio calculations provide deeper insights into the exchange models and rationalize the relaxation/tunnelling pathways. These results demonstrate here provide a fire&#8208;new perspective in modulating the magnetization relaxation via the incorporation of controllable spin states and magnetic interactions facilitated by the CISSS approach.

         <title>Boosting the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO by Ligand Engineering of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active electrocatalyst for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion was successfully prepared by the ligand engineering of Au25 nanoclusters with a cation&#8208;relaying ligand. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized nanoclusters was significantly boosted when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of the ligand, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT=1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+&lt;Na+&lt;K+&lt;Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.

         <title>Quantification of Native Lignin Structural Features with Gel&#8208;Phase 2D&#8208;HSQC0 Reveals Lignin Structural Changes During Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a method featuring an extrapolated time&#8208;zero Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) sequence on whole cell walls samples, we can successfully quantify native lignin's structural features. Applying this tool to compare whole cell wall samples to extracted lignin reveals fundamental differences in the apparent linkage distribution within the polymer, which provides insight into lignin's fractionation mechanism.







Abstract
Our ability to study and valorize the lignin fraction of biomass is hampered by the fundamental and still unmet challenge of precisely quantifying native lignin's structural features. Here, we developed a rapid elevated&#8208;temperature 1H&#8722;13C Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) NMR method that enables this precise quantification of native lignin structural characteristics even with whole plant cell wall (WPCW) NMR spectroscopy, overcoming fast spin relaxation in the gel phase. We also formulated a Gaussian fitting algorithm to perform automatic and reliable spectral integration. By combining HSQC0 measurements with yield measurements following depolymerisation, we can confirm the combinatorial nature of radical coupling reactions during biosynthesis leading to a random sequential organization of linkages within a largely linear lignin chain. Such analyses illustrate how this analytical method can greatly facilitate the study of native lignin structure, which can then be used for fundamental studies or to understand lignin depolymerization methods like reductive catalytic fractionation or aldehyde&#8208;assisted fractionation.

         <title>Solar Azo&#8208;Switches for Effective E&#8594;Z Photoisomerization by Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sunlight&#8208;induced isomerization of azo&#8208;switches is realized through spectral reshaping. Our sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches absorb across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum and achieve 80&#8211;90&#8201;% E&#8594;Z isomerization yields under unfiltered sunlight. Solar switches hold great potential for sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy utilization for applications such as molecular machines, actuators, and molecular solar thermal storage.







Abstract
Natural photoactive systems have evolved to harness broad&#8208;spectrum light from solar radiation for critical functions such as light perception and photosynthetic energy conversion. Molecular photoswitches, which undergo structural changes upon light absorption, are artificial photoactive tools widely used for developing photoresponsive systems and converting light energy. However, photoswitches generally need to be activated by light of specific narrow wavelength ranges for effective photoconversion, which limits their ability to directly work under sunlight and to efficiently harvest solar energy. Here, focusing on azo&#8208;switches&#8212;the most extensively studied photoswitches, we demonstrate effective solar E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with photoconversions exceeding 80&#8201;% under unfiltered sunlight. These sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches are developed by rendering the absorption of E isomers overwhelmingly stronger than that of Z isomers across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum. This unusual type of spectral profile is realized by a simple yet highly adjustable molecular design strategy, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of spectral window that extends light absorption beyond 600&#8197;nm. Notably, back&#8208;photoconversion can be achieved without impairing the forward solar isomerization, resulting in unique light&#8208;reversible solar switches. Such exceptional solar chemistry of photoswitches provides unprecedented opportunities for developing sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy technologies.

         <title>Symmetric Electron Transfer Coordinates are Intrinsic to Bridged Systems: An ab Initio Treatment of the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We identify a symmetric dimension that is important for electron transfer or electronic localization from quantum chemical calculations and find that it naturally occurs in bridged mixed&#8208;valent systems as a consequence of the superexchange coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A long&#8208;standing question in electron transfer research concerns the number and identity of collective nuclear motions that drive electron transfer or localisation. It is well established that these nuclear motions are commonly gathered into a so&#8208;called electron transfer coordinate. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate that both anti&#8208;symmetric and symmetric vibrational motions are intrinsic to bridged systems, and that both are required to explain the characteristic shape of their intervalence charge transfer bands. Using the properties of a two&#8208;state Marcus&#8211;Hush model, we identify and quantify these two coordinates as linear combinations of normal modes from ab initio calculations. This quantification gives access to the potential coupling, reorganization energy and curvature of the potential energy surfaces involved in electron transfer, independent of any prior assumptions about the system of interest. We showcase these claims with the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, a prototypical Class III mixed valence complex. We find that the symmetric dimension is responsible for the asymmetric band shape, and trace this back to the offset of the ground and excited state potentials in this dimension. The significance of the symmetric dimension originates from geometry dependent coupling, which in turn is a natural consequence of the well&#8208;established superexchange mechanism. The conceptual connection between the symmetric and anti&#8208;symmetric motions and the superexchange mechanism appears as a general result for bridged systems.

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>

Nowadays, the energy demand is increasing, so non&#8208;renewable resources are being consumed rapidly. Therefore, the need for renewable energy storage devices has become more urgent. SSLMBs eagerly evolve into small sizes, light mass, high energy density, good cycling performance, no memory effect, and environmental friendliness.

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8722; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the energy demand is increasing, so non-renewable resources are being consumed rapidly. Therefore, the need for renewable energy storage devices has become more urgent. SSLMBs eagerly evolve into small sizes, light mass, high energy density, good cycling performance, no memory effect, and environmental friendliness. However, the low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact hinder SSLMBs&#8217; practical application. In this paper, the flexible SPE of in situ polymerized PAAA opens and stabilizes the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &#8242;highway&#8242; inside the SPE, enhancing Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, and the oxygen vacancies of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synergize with the substrate to bind the TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, forming and transporting freer Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thus achieving high performance of SSLMBs at room temperature.

         <title>Boosting Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion to Ethanol via Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst with Defected Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8208;N2 Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst with defected Cu&#8208;N2 motif was prepared by a CN intermediate&#8208;assisted impregnation strategy. Cu+/Cu2+ dual&#8208;valence state and electron enrichment of Cu sites in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V favorable to *CO adsorption and then C&#8722;C coupling, enabling CO2 photoreduction to ethanol.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been shown to selectively catalyze CO2 photoreduction to C2+ solar fuels. However, they still suffer from poor activity and low selectivity. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance carbon nitride supported Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring defected low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;N2 motif (Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V). Lead many recently reported photocatalysts and its Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4 counterparts, Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol and delivers 69.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 ethanol production rate, 97.8&#8201;% electron&#8208;based ethanol selectivity, and a yield of ~10 times higher than Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4. Revealed by the extensive experimental investigation combined with DFT calculations, the superior photoactivity of Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V stems from its defected Cu&#8208;N2 configuration, in which the Cu sites are electron enriched and enhance electron delocalization. Importantly, Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exist in both Cu+ and Cu2+ valence states, although predominantly as Cu+. The Cu+ sites support the CO2 activation, while the co&#8208;existence of Cu+/Cu2+ sites are highly conducive for strong *CO adsorption and subsequent *CO&#8208;*CO dimerization enabling C&#8722;C coupling. Furthermore, the hollow microstructure of the catalyst also promotes light adsorption and charge separation efficiency. Collectively, these make Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V an effective and high&#8208;performance catalyst for the solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to ethanol. This study also elucidates the C&#8208;C coupling reaction path via *CO&#8208;*CO to *COCOH and rate&#8208;determining step, and reveals the valence state change of partial Cu species from Cu+ to Cu2+ in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V during CO2 photoreduction reaction.

         <title>On Tautomerism and Amphoterism: An In&#8208;Depth Structural and Physicochemical Characterization of Ammeline and Some of Its Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammeline was solved for the first time nearly 200&#8197;years after its discovery by Justus von Liebig. Moreover, several salts of ammeline were synthesized and structurally characterized to study its amphoteric behavior and the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure in the solid. Finally, the potential of ammeline as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials was examined.







Abstract
Ammeline is a simple, readily available, molecular compound, which has been known for nearly 200&#8197;years. Despite that, no proper structural characterization of ammeline has been conducted so far. For this reason, the prevalent tautomeric form of ammeline in the solid remained unknown to this date. In the course of this study, its crystal structure was finally established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In this structure, ammeline is exclusively found as its 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one tautomer and adopts layered structure with an exceptionally high hydrogen bond density. Ammeline shows an interesting amphoteric behavior. Therefore, the synthesis and structural characterization of some of its salts were carried out to investigate the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure. In particular, the crystal structure of silver ammelinate monohydrate was solved as the first reported structure containing deprotonated ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three different modifications of ammelinium perchlorate were elucidated and the transformation conditions between them were studied. Lastly, the crystal structure of ammelinediium diperchlorate monohydrate, containing unprecedented doubly protonated ammeline, was determined. The products&#8217; thermal behavior was studied by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The perchlorate salts were additionally examined for their potential as insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.

         <title>Transient Covalent Polymers through Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent polymers generated by chemical fuel reactions should serve as useful model systems for nonequilibrium assembly. Here, aqueous poly(anhydrides) have been generated by treatment of dicarboxylic acid monomers with carbodiimides. Molecular weights over 15,000 have been achieved, with polymer lifetimes on the order of hours to weeks. The effect of solvent, reactant concentrations, and temperature has been examined.







Abstract
Biochemical systems make use of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium polymers generated under kinetic control. Inspired by these systems, many abiotic supramolecular polymers driven by chemical fuel reactions have been reported. Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated. The results reveal substantial control over polymer assembly and disassembly kinetics, highlighting the potential for fine&#8208;tuned kinetic control in nonequilibrium polymerization systems.

         <title>Coupling CO2 Reduction and Acetyl&#8208;CoA Formation: The Role of a CO Capturing Tunnel in Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase (CODH)/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (ACS) complex couples catalysis at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the generated CO. Hydrophobic sites with affinity for CO within the tunnel act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Our tunnel remodeling suggests that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.







Abstract
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl moiety and CoA to acetyl&#8208;CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. In this study, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Full Battery with Ultrahigh Capacity</title>

We synthesize the rare earth metal Sm SACs on N&#8208;doped carbon substrate. Theoretical calculations and experimental results both indicate that the Sm SACs have the structure of Sm&#8208;N3C3. With this design, the 4f orbital polarizes the 5d orbital, the electronic states near dxz/yz increases, and the d orbital achieves a maximized overlap with the p orbital when interacting with LiPSs, resulting in an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization which provides high activity for accelerating LiPSs reaction kinetics and Li homogeneous deposition.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have many advantages but still face problems such as retarded polysulfides redox kinetics and Li dendrite growth. Most reported single atom catalysts (SACs) for Li&#8722;S batteries are based on d&#8208;band transition metals whose d orbital constitutes active valence band, which is inclined to occur catalyst passivation. SACs based on 4f inner valence orbital of rare earth metals are challenging for their great difficulty to be activated. In this work, we design and synthesize the first rare earth metal Sm SACs which has electron&#8208;rich 4f inner orbital to promote catalytic conversion of polysulfides and uniform deposition of Li. Sm SACs enhance the catalysis by the activated 4f orbital through an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Using Sm&#8208;N3C3 modified separators, the half cells deliver a high capacity over 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a retention rate of 84.3&#8201;% after 2000 cycles. The fabricated Sm&#8208;N3C3&#8208;Li|Sm&#8208;N3C3@PP|S/CNTs full batteries can provide an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of a retention rate of 80.6&#8201;% at 0.2&#8201;C after 100 cycles, one of the best full Li&#8722;S batteries. This work provides a new perspective for the development of rare earth metal single atom catalysis in electrochemical reactions of Li&#8722;S batteries and other electrochemical systems for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Cobaltaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was devised to access molecules with central and axial chirality with up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio. The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalysis was enabled by highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, enantioselective electrocatalysis has surfaced as an increasingly&#8208;effective platform for sustainable molecular synthesis. Despite indisputable progress, strategies that allow the control of two distinct stereogenic elements with high selectivity remain elusive. In contrast, we, herein, describe electrochemical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations that enable the installation of chiral stereogenic centers along with a chiral axis with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. The developed electrocatalysis strategy allowed for C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H activations/annulations with cyclic and non&#8208;cyclic alkenes providing expedient access to various central as well as atropo&#8208;chiral dihydroisoquinolinones paired to the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction. Studies on the atropo&#8208;stability of the obtained compounds demonstrated that the exceedingly mild conditions ensured by the electrocatalytic process were key for the achieved high stereoselectivities.

         <title>Bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn Mediator in N&#8208;coordinated Mn Single Atoms and Pt Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biomolecule Oxidation and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid catalyst composed of carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms is developed for biomolecule electrooxidation. The direct electron transfer between Pt nanoparticles and Mn single atoms as well as the construction of bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators during reaction result in a significant improvement in detection and discrimination performances towards dopamine and uric acid.







Abstract
The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms (PtNPs/MnNC) is developed. The metal&#8208;metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic&#8208;bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between PtNPs and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from PtNPs to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8722;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, PtNPs/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on PtNPs/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysts for sensitive sensing platforms.

Acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction with high conversion, &gt; acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, and high universality, applicable to all typical types of acetals and thiols, was discovered for the facile synthesis of dynamic dithioacetals and readily recyclable polymers without catalyst and solvent. It provides a green and high&#8208;efficient reaction for the sustainable development of organic, polymer, material, medical chemistries, etc.







Abstract
Dithioacetals are heavily used in organic, material and medical chemistries, and exhibit huge potential to synthesize degradable or recyclable polymers. However, the current synthetic approaches of dithioacetals and polydithioacetals are overwhelmingly dependent on external catalysts and organic solvents. Herein, we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction for synthesizing dithioacetals and polydithioacetals. High conversion, higher than acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, can be achieved. High universality was confirmed by monitoring the reactions of linear and cyclic acetals (including renewable bio&#8208;sourced furan&#8208;acetal) with aliphatic and aromatic thiols, and the reaction mechanism of monomolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and auto&#8208;protonation (activation) by thiol was clarified by combining experiments and density functional theory computation. Subsequently, we utilize this reaction to synthesize readily recyclable polydithioacetals. By simple heating and stirring, linear polydithioacetals with 

M&#8254;

 ${\bar M}$



w of ~110&#8197;kDa were synthesized from acetal and dithiol, and depolymerization into macrocyclic dithioacetal and repolymerization into polydithioacetal can be achieved; through reactive extrusion, a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer dynamic network with excellent mechanical properties and continuous reprocessability was prepared from poly(vinyl butyral) and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). This green and high&#8208;efficient synthesis method for dithioacetals and polydithioacetals is beneficial to the sustainable development of chemistry.

         <title>A Cyclometalated Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces Oncosis for Synergistic Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus and mitochondria dual&#8208;localized ruthenium(II) complex disrupts DNA to activate PARP1 protein combined with ATP consumption and produces mitochondrial oxidative stress, triggering porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 protein to induce cell oncosis and boosting innate and adaptive immunity.







Abstract
An optimal cancer chemotherapy regimen should effectively address the drug resistance of tumors while eliciting antitumor&#8208;immune responses. Research has shown that non&#8208;apoptotic cell death, such as pyroptosis and ferroptosis, can enhance the immune response. Despite this, there has been limited investigation and reporting on the mechanisms of oncosis and its correlation with immune response. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ru(II) complex that targeted the nucleus and mitochondria to induce cell oncosis. Briefly, the Ru(II) complex disrupts the nucleus and mitochondria DNA, which active polyADP&#8208;ribose polymerase&#8197;1, accompanied by ATP consumption and porimin activation. Concurrently, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress result in the release of Ca2+ ions and increased expression of Calpain&#8197;1. Subsequently, specific pore proteins porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 promote cristae destruction or vacuolation, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture. The analysis of RNA sequencing demonstrates that the Ru(II) complex can initiate the oncosis&#8208;associated pathway and activate both innate and adaptive immunity. In vivo experiments have confirmed that oncosis promotes dendritic cell maturation and awakens adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also activates the innate immune by inducing the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 phenotype.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Trigger Rapid Charge Transport Channels at the Engineered Interface of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Boosting Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst with advanced performance is developed. Rapid charge transport ways triggered by Ovs at the heterointerface are unveiled by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS). The mechanism of Ovs on this S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is revealed by comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) have been intensively studied in single semiconductor photocatalysts, exploration of intrinsic mechanisms and in&#8208;depth understanding of Ovs in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are still limited. Herein, a novel S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst made from WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 with Ovs at the heterointerface is rationally designed. The microscopic environment and local electronic structure of the S&#8208;scheme heterointerface are well optimized by Ovs. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveals that Ovs trigger additional charge movement routes and therefore increase charge separation efficiency. In addition, Ovs have a synergistic effect on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts. As a result, the optimal photocatalytic performance is significantly improved, surpassing that of single component WO3&#8208;Ov and In2S3 (by 35.5 and 3.9&#8197;times, respectively), as well as WO3/In2S3 heterojunction. This work provides new insight into regulating the photogenerated carrier dynamics at the heterointerface and also helps design highly efficient S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts.

         <title>Fabrication of Coffee&#8208;Ring Nanostructured Membranes for Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization to construct coffee&#8208;ring structured the membrane. These features render 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective filtration area of the membrane, and thereby realizing a 2.7&#8208;fold boost in the MeOH permeance. Moreover, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) plays important roles in pharmaceutical ingredients purification and solvent recovery. However, the low organic solvent permeance under cross&#8208;flow operation of OSN membrane hampers their industrial applications. Herein, we report the construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane featuring high OSN permeance. A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization. Owing to the diffusion of EtOH to n&#8208;hexane, coffee&#8208;ring nanostructure on the support membrane appeared, which served as the template for construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane. The optimal nanostructured membrane demonstrated 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective surface area with reduced membrane thickness. Resultantly, the membrane afforded a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in organic solvent permeance, e.g., ~13&#8197;LMH/bar for MeOH, without sacrificing the rejection ability. Moreover, due to the rigid monomer structure, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of Hollow Fiber SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite Membranes for High&#8208;Pressure CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite is a benchmark membrane material for natural gas upgrading. The membranes were facilely synthesized by adopting the novel FAU&#8208;CHA seeds. An excellent CO2/CH4 separation performance was achieved even under pressure up to 6.1&#8197;MPa. The successful scaled&#8208;up synthesis paves the way for practical applications of zeolite membranes for gas separation.







Abstract
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes are highly desired for natural gas upgrading because of their separation performance in combination with superior mechanical and chemical stability. However, the narrow synthesis condition range significantly constrains scale&#8208;up preparation. Herein, we propose a facile interzeolite conversion approach using the FAU zeolite to prepare SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite seeds, featuring a shorter induction and a longer crystallization period of the membrane synthesis on hollow fiber substrates. The membrane thickness was constant at ~3&#8197;&#956;m over a wide span of synthesis time (24&#8208;96&#8197;h), while the selectivity (separation efficiency) was easily improved by extending the synthesis time without compromising permeance (throughput). At 0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K, the membranes showed an average CO2 permeance of (5.2&#177;0.5)&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 (1530&#8197;GPU), with an average CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity of 143&#177;7.

     alt="Improved Synthesis of Hollow Fiber SSZ-13 Zeolite Membranes for High-Pressure CO2/CH4 Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-silica CHA zeolite is a benchmark membrane material for natural gas upgrading. The membranes were facilely synthesized by adopting the novel FAU-CHA seeds. An excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance was achieved even under pressure up to 6.1&#8197;MPa. The successful scaled-up synthesis paves the way for practical applications of zeolite membranes for gas separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-silica CHA zeolite membranes are highly desired for natural gas upgrading because of their separation performance in combination with superior mechanical and chemical stability. However, the narrow synthesis condition range significantly constrains scale-up preparation. Herein, we propose a facile interzeolite conversion approach using the FAU zeolite to prepare SSZ-13 zeolite seeds, featuring a shorter induction and a longer crystallization period of the membrane synthesis on hollow fiber substrates. The membrane thickness was constant at ~3&#8197;&#956;m over a wide span of synthesis time (24-96&#8197;h), while the selectivity (separation efficiency) was easily improved by extending the synthesis time without compromising permeance (throughput). At 0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K, the membranes showed an average CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of (5.2&#177;0.5)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;mol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;Pa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (1530&#8197;GPU), with an average CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixture selectivity of 143&#177;7. Minimal defects ensure a high selectivity of 126 with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeation flux of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 6.1&#8197;MPa feed pressure, far surpassing requirements for industrial applications. The feasibility for successful scale-up of our approach was further demonstrated by the batch synthesis of 40&#8197;cm-long hollow fiber SSZ-13 zeolite membranes exhibiting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixture selectivity up to 400 (0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K) without using sweep gas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Considerable Piezochromism in All&#8208;Inorganic Zero&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
Successive piezochromism with considerable range of 232&#8197;nm from blue to red is achieved in all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional perovskite nanocrystals through pressure&#8208;modulated self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions, which is very crucial to pressure stability monitoring for facilities working at extreme environments. Furthermore, the highly stable and bright green emission enhanced by over five times is quenched upon decompression.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials refer to a class of matters that alter their photoluminescence (PL) colors in response to the external stimuli, which exhibit promising smart applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optoelectronic memory and pressure&#8208;sensing. However, so far, most reported piezochromic materials have been confined to organic materials or hybrid materials containing organic moieties with limited piezochromic range of less than 100&#8197;nm in visible region. Here, we achieved an intriguing piezochromism in all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals (NCs) with a considerable piezochromic range of 232&#8197;nm because of their unique inorganic rigid structure. The PL energy shifted from the lowest&#8208;energy red fluorescence (1.85&#8197;eV) to the highest&#8208;energy blue fluorescence (2.83&#8197;eV), covering almost the entire visible wavelength range. Pressure&#8208;modulated self&#8208;trapped exciton emission between different energy levels of self&#8208;trapped states within Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs was the main reason for this piezochromism property. Note that the quenched emission, which is over five times more intense than that in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon decompression. This work provides a promising pressure indicating material, particularly used in pressure stability monitoring for equipment working at extreme environments.

         <title>Cu1&#8722;Fe Dual Sites for Superior Neutral Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Cu is anchored on the oxide layer of Fe@Cu1FeOx to form Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;sites. The synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and the strengthened water activation on Cu sites decreases the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO hydrogenation, resulting in superior electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is able to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into reusable ammonia (NH3), offering a green treatment and resource utilization strategy of nitrate wastewater and ammonia synthesis. The conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3 undergoes water dissociation to generate active hydrogen atoms and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation tandemly. The two relay processes compete for the same active sites, especially under pH&#8208;neutral condition, resulting in the suboptimal efficiency and selectivity in the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;. Herein, we constructed a Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst by anchoring Cu single atoms on amorphous iron oxide shell of nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) for the electrochemical NO3RR, achieving an impressive NO3&#8722; removal efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% and NH3 selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% under neutral pH and nitrate concentration of 50&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;&#8722;N conditions, greatly surpassing the performance of nZVI counterpart. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and strengthened water activation on single&#8208;atom Cu sites, decreasing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH. This work develops a novel strategy of fabricating dual&#8208;site catalysts to enhance the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;, and presents an environmentally sustainable approach for neutral nitrate wastewater treatment.

         <title>Allyl&#8208;Allyl Coupling Promoted by Catalyst Systems with two Palladium Atoms &#8211; A Plethora of Potentially Pericyclic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plethora of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in a palladium promoted allyl coupling reaction was explored with quantum chemical computations, with results implying that one should perhaps consider such processes regularly, but do so with caution. The results of these calculations lead to a revision of the mechanism for a recently reported allyl coupling reaction that makes use of an unusual outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination.







Abstract
Recently, Huang and co&#8208;workers reported a catalytic reaction that utilizes H2 as the sole reductant for a C&#8722;C coupling of allyl groups with yields up to 96&#8201;%. Here we use computational quantum chemistry to identify several key features of this reaction that provide clarity on how it proceeds. We propose the involvement of a Pd&#8722;Pd bound dimer precatalyst, demonstrate the importance of ligand &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and counterions, and identify a new, energetically viable, mechanism involving two dimerized, outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination transition structures that determine both the rate and selectivity. Although we rule out the previously proposed transmetalation step on energetic grounds, we show it to have an unusual aromatic transition structure in which two Pd atoms support rearranging electrons. The prevalence of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in this system suggests that one should consider such processes regularly, but the results of our calculations also indicate that one should do so with caution.

An external method to quantitatively analyze the oxidation stability of electrolyte systems is proposed. It was shown that &#8220;anion&#8208;less&#8221; solvated structures are more resistant to oxidation than &#8220;anion&#8208;rich&#8221; ones owing to the weakening of the anion polarization effect. These findings provide a molecular perspective for electrolyte design in rechargeable high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal Batteries.







Abstract
Rational design of advanced electrolytes to improve the high&#8208;voltage capability has been attracting wide attention as one critical solution to enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the limited understanding of electrolyte antioxidant chemistry as well as the lack of valid quantization approaches have resulted in knowledge gap, which hinders the formulation of new electrolytes. Herein, we construct a standard curve based on representative solvation structures to quantify the oxidation stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes, which reveals the linear correlation between the oxidation potential and the atomic charge of the least oxidation&#8208;resistant solvent. Dictated by the regularity between solvation composition and oxidation potential, a (Trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte dominated by anion&#8208;less solvation structures was designed to optimize the cycling performance of 4.5&#8197;V 30&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Li||3.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8208;LiCoO2 batteries, which maintained 80&#8201;% capacity retention even after 440 cycles. The consistency of experimental and computational results validates the proposed principles, offering a fundamental guideline to evaluate and design aggressive electrochemical systems.

&lt;p&gt;An external method to quantitatively analyze the oxidation stability of electrolyte systems is proposed. It was shown that &#8220;anion-less&#8221; solvated structures are more resistant to oxidation than &#8220;anion-rich&#8221; ones owing to the weakening of the anion polarization effect. These findings provide a molecular perspective for electrolyte design in rechargeable high-energy Li-metal Batteries.

         <title>Core&#8208;Alkynylated Fluorescent Flippers: Altered Ultrafast Photophysics to Track Thick Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elongated flipper probes with one and two alkynes in the core merge flipper&#8208; and rotor&#8208;like behavior to take photophysical properties to a new level of sophistication and introduce hydrophobic matching with one single leaflet as operational strategy to mechanosensitively track bilayer membranes by their thickness.







Abstract
Fluorescent flippers have been introduced as small&#8208;molecule probes to image membrane tension in living systems. This study describes the design, synthesis, spectroscopic and imaging properties of flippers that are elongated by one and two alkynes inserted between the push and the pull dithienothiophene domains. The resulting mechanophores combine characteristics of flippers, reporting on physical compression in the ground state, and molecular rotors, reporting on torsional motion in the excited state, to take their photophysics to new level of sophistication. Intensity ratios in broadened excitation bands from differently twisted conformers of core&#8208;alkynylated flippers thus report on mechanical compression. Lifetime boosts from ultrafast excited&#8208;state planarization and lifetime drops from competitive intersystem crossing into triplet states report on viscosity. In standard lipid bilayer membranes, core&#8208;alkynylated flippers are too long for one leaflet and tilt or extend into disordered interleaflet space, which preserves rotor&#8208;like torsional disorder and thus weak, blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence. Flipper&#8208;like planarization occurs only in highly ordered membranes of matching leaflet thickness, where they light up and selectively report on these thick membranes with red&#8208;shifted, sharpened excitation maxima, high intensity and long lifetime.

         <title>Are Redox&#8208;Active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry textbooks teach that the behavior of charged redox centers bound by saturated linkers is essentially governed by electrostatics. We show that for short alkanes and pyridiniums, as Coulombic and through&#8208;bond interactions become ineffective, reductive cyclomer formation is governed by London dispersion and &#963;&#8208;type overlap of 2pz atomic orbitals of the C&#947; atoms of electrophoric ends rather than by electron spin&#8208;spin interaction.







Abstract
The extent to which electrophores covalently bridged by a saturated linker are electrochemically independent was investigated considering the charge/spin duality of the electron and functionality of the electrophore as a spin carrier upon reduction. By combining computational modeling with electrochemical experiments, we investigated the mechanism by which tethered electrophores react together within 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oligo[n]methylene&#8208;bipyridinium assemblies (with n=2 to 5). We show that native dicationic electrophores (redox state Z=+2) are folded prior to electron injection into the system, allowing the emergence of supra&#8208;molecular orbitals (supra&#8208;MOs) likely to support the process of the reductive &#963; bond formation giving cyclomers. Indeed, for Z=+2, London Dispersion (LD) forces contribute to flatten the potential energy surface such that all&#8208;trans and folded conformers are approximately isoenergetic. Then, upon one&#8208;electron injection, for radical cations (Z=+1), LD forces significantly stabilize the folded conformers, except for the ethylene derivative deprived of supra&#8208;MOs. For radical cations equipped with supra&#8208;MOs, the unpaired electron is delocalized over both heterocycles through space. Cyclomer completion (Z=0) upon the second electron transfer occurs according to the inversion of redox potentials. This mechanism explains why intramolecular reactivity is favored and why pyridinium electrophores are not independent.

An intriguing bottom&#8208;up molecular engineering approach is revealed toward single&#8208;step synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich laterally&#8208;fused stimuli&#8208;responsive polycyclic heteroarenes, leveraging a highly step&#8208;economic octuple C&#8722;H activation manifold for simultaneous creation of hexagon&#8208;containing planar and heptagon&#8208;containing nonplanar skeletons on readily available triazolium template.







Abstract
Curiosity&#8208;driven innovations on the design and synthesis of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds with new molecular topologies unfold exciting opportunities for harnessing their intriguing supramolecular properties and thereby the development of novel functional organic materials. This work presents such an innovative synthetic concept of a bottom&#8208;up molecular topology engineering through a unique orchestrated octuple C&#8722;H activation reaction, toward the rapid synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;incorporated nitrogen&#8208;doped laterally&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds with rarely reported wavy structural configuration. The profound impact of the molecular wavy structures of these compounds on their properties is manifested by weak and tunable solid&#8208;state intermolecular interactions controlling the electronic properties of the materials, leading to reversibly switchable fluorochromism in the solid state and thin films with mechanical force and solvent vapors as external stimuli, thereby indicating their potential applicability in rewritable fluorescent optical recording media, security papers, mechanosensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors etc.

         <title>Anion Modulation of Ag&#8208;Imidazole Cuboctahedral Cage Microenvironments for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have fabricated three Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral coordination cages (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) which exhibit inner/outside coordination microenvironments, and metal/nonmetal active sites for synergistic enhancement of selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes.







Abstract
How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal&#8208;organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well&#8208;defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self&#8208;assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;benzylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzene (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes of 86.1&#8201;% (acidic), 94.1&#8201;% (neutral) and 95.3&#8201;% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;ClO4 and Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag&#8208;site is stabilized by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen&#8208;bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag&#8208;centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag&#8208;coordination geometry and host&#8211;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.

The metal-organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well-defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self-assembly of Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5-tris(1-benzylbenzimidazol-2-yl) benzene (Ag-MOC-X, X=NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag-MOC-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH-universal electrolytes of 86.1&#8201;% (acidic), 94.1&#8201;% (neutral) and 95.3&#8201;% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag-MOC-ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag-MOC-BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on unsaturated Ag-site is stabilized by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen-bonding of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag-centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag-coordination geometry and host&#8211;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high-efficient electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Regulate Zinc Plating/Stripping Behaviors for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent PBSC interface is designed on the zinc anode with self&#8208;adaptation and shear&#8208;thickening properties by blending polyborosiloxane (PBS) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The reversible association/disassociation of dynamic B&#8722;O bonds enhances local structural integrity, effectively impeding continuous zinc dendrite growth and mitigating hydrogen evolution, ensuring stable zinc plating/stripping behaviors with enhanced cycling performance.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces provide a comprehensive approach to controlling zinc dendrite and surface corrosion in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, due to consistent volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, traditional interfacial layers cannot consistently adapt to the dendrite surface, resulting in uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution. Herein, dynamic covalent bonds exhibit the Janus effect towards zinc deposition at different current densities, presenting a holistic strategy for stabilizing zinc anode. The PBSC intelligent artificial interface consisting of dynamic B&#8722;O covalent bonds is developed on zinc anode to mitigate hydrogen evolution and restrict dendrite expansion. Owing to the reversible dynamic bonds, PBSC exhibits shape self&#8208;adaptive characteristics at low current rates, which rearranges the network to accommodate volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, resisting hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the rapid association of B&#8722;O dynamic bonds enhances mechanical strength at dendrite tips, presenting a shear&#8208;thickening effect and suppressing further dendrite growth at high current rates. Therefore, the assembled symmetrical battery with PBSC maintains a stable cycle of 4500&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation and the PBSC@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates a specific capacity exceeding 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the intelligent interface with dynamic covalent bonds provides innovative approaches for zinc anode interfacial engineering and enhances cycling performance.

         <title>Integrated Design for Discrete Sulfur@Polymer Nanoreactor with Tandem Connection as Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of transistor integration, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining NS in conductive polymer reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete nanoreactor units bonded on CNTs. Meanwhile, excellent performance is achieved through tandem connection with CNTs, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs.







Abstract
Apart from electrode material modification, architecture design and optimization are important approaches for improving lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. Herein, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining nanosulfur (NS) in conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete independent nanoreactor units bonded onto carbon nanotubes (noted as CNT/NS@PEDOT). The unique spatial confinement and concentration gradients of sulfur@PEDOT nanoreactors (SP&#8208;NRs) can promote reaction kinetics while facilitating rapid polysulfide transformation and minimizing dissolution and diffusion losses. Meanwhile, overall ultrahigh energy input and output are achieved through tandem connection with carbon nanotubes, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs. As a result, it delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1246&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C and 918&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8201;C, the low capacity decay rate per lap of 0.011&#8201;% is achieved at a current density of 1&#8201;C after 1000 cycles. This research emphasizes the innovative structural design to provide a fresh trajectory for the further advancement of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Industrial&#8208;Scale Hard Carbon Designed to Regulate Electrochemical Polarization for Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile but scalable strategy to decrease electrochemical polarization by accurately regulating multiple structural features for industrial&#8208;scale hard carbon enabling rapid sodium storage is proposed via adjusting the components of precursors.







Abstract
Given the merits of abundant resource, low cost and high electrochemical activity, hard carbons have been regarded as one of the most commercializable anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, poor rate capability is one of the main obstacles that severely hinder its further development. In addition, the relationships between preparation method, material structure and electrochemical performance have not been clearly elaborated. Herein, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to accurately construct the multiple structural features in hard carbon via adjusting the components of precursors. Through detailed physical characterization of the hard carbons derived from different regulation steps, and further combined with in&#8208;situ Raman and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analysis, the network of multiple relationships between preparation method, microstructure, sodium storage behavior and electrochemical performance have been successfully established. Simultaneously, exceptional rate capability about 108.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 have been achieved from RHC sample with high reversible capacity and desirable initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Additionally, the practical applications can be extended to cylindrical battery with excellent cycle behaviors. Such facile approach can provide guidance for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;performance hard carbons and provides the possibility of building practical SIBs with high energy density and durability.

         <title>Tuning Adsorbate&#8208;Mediated Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction by Oxygen Vacancy: A Case Study in Ru/TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the initial oxygen vacancy concentration of a catalyst supports can regulate the formation of adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) and its stability under reaction conditions. The concept is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation on Ru/TiO2.







Abstract
The adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) offers a reversible means of altering the selectivity of supported metal catalysts, thereby providing a powerful tool for facile modulation of catalytic performance. However, the fundamental understanding of A&#8208;SMSI remains inadequate and methods for tuning A&#8208;SMSI are still in their nascent stages, impeding its stabilization under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the initial concentration of oxygen vacancy in oxide supports plays a key role in tuning the A&#8208;SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and defected titania (TiO2&#8208;x). Based on this new understanding, we demonstrate the in situ formation of A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions, obviating the typically required CO2&#8208;rich pretreatment. The as&#8208;formed A&#8208;SMSI layer exhibits remarkable stability at various temperatures, enabling excellent activity, selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalyzing the reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction. This study deepens the understanding of the A&#8208;SMSI and the ability to stabilize A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions represents a key step for practical catalytic applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;component Copolymerized Donors enable Frozen Nano&#8208;morphology and Superior Ductility for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of efficient multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) P10.8/P20.2, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl, P10.7/P20.3&#8208;TCl, and P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl were synthesized, and excellent efficiencies in both rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs along with fracture strain in pristine film (16.59&#8201;%) for P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl were achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) have gained significant interest and have been rapidly developed in flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) in recent years. However, ensuring the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;OSCs while retaining ideal mechanical properties remains an enormous challenge. The fracture strain (FS) value of typical high&#8208;efficiency blend films is generally less than 8&#8201;%, which is far from the application standards of wearable photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a series of novel MCDs after meticulous molecular design. Among them, the consistent MCD backbone and end&#8208;capped functional group formed a highly conjugated molecular plane, and the solubilization and mechanical properties were effectively optimized by modifying the proportion of solubilized alkyl chains. Consequently, due to the formation of entangled structures with a frozen blend film morphology considerably improved the high ductility of the active layer, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl exhibited efficient PCE in rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs, along with excellent FS values (16.59&#8201;%) in pristine films, meanwhile, the outstanding FS values of 25.18&#8201;% and 12.3&#8201;% were achieved by P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl &#8208;based pristine and blend films, respectively, which were one of the highest records achieved by end&#8208;capped MCD&#8208;based binary OSCs, demonstrating promising application to synchronize the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and mechanically ductile flexible OSCs.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyses Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from Taxus x media cell cultures, is functionally characterized to efficiently catalyze oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate&#8208;feeding and isotope labelling experiments together with density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from Taxus&#215;media cell cultures, has been functionally characterized to efficiently catalyse the formation of the oxetane ring in tetracyclic taxoids. Transient expression of TmCYP1 in Nicotiana benthamiana using 2&#945;,5&#945;,7&#946;,9&#945;,10&#946;,13&#945;&#8208;hexaacetoxytaxa&#8208;4(20),11(12)&#8208;diene (1) as a substrate led to the production of a major oxetane derivative, 1&#946;&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1&#8201;a), and a minor 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide derivative, baccatin I (1&#8201;b). However, feeding the substrate decinnamoyltaxinine J (2), a 5&#8208;deacetylated derivative of 1, yielded only 5&#945;&#8208;deacetylbaccatin I (2&#8201;b), a 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate&#8208;feeding, 2H and 18O isotope labelling experiments, and density functional theory calculations. This reaction could be an intramolecular oxidation&#8208;acetoxyl rearrangement and the construction of the oxetane ring may occur through a concerted process; however, the 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide might be a shunt product. In this process, the C5&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group in substrate is crucial for the oxetane ring formation but not for the 4(20)&#8208;epoxy ring formation by TmCYP1. These findings provide a better understanding of the enzymatic formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;production of Benzoquinone and H2 Using Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a heterogeneous nano&#8208;electrocatalyst consisting of Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF was synthesized using a partial vulcanization method for composition design. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional electrochemical oxidation performance of phenol (EOP). The self&#8208;assembled alkali&#8208;acid hybrid electrolytic cell can operate continuously for more than 300&#8197;hours at a fixed potential of 0.9&#8197;V. At the same time, through the design and equipment integration of the alkali&#8208;acid electrolytic cell, for the very first time, the anodic oxidation of phenol organic pollutants with the cathodic hydrogen production.







Abstract
In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions. Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99&#8201;%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction (EOP). Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation in an alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60&#8197;V was applied to produce a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90&#8197;V for 12&#8197;days, showing remarkable long&#8208;term stability. The unique configuration of the acid&#8208;base hybrid flow cell electrolyzer provides valuable guidance for the efficient and environmentally friendly electrooxidation of phenol to benzoquinone.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Donor1&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor2 Motifs Regulating Local Charge of Intercalated Single Cobalt Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Amongst, Co/Cu3&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF exhibited exceptional activity and tunable syngas (CO/H2) by various bipyridines. The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs on the donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 structure can induce the oriented electron transfer from dual donors to the Co center, promoting CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) has attracted increasing interest in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, but it remains a challenge to achieve high conversion efficiency owing to the insufficient active site and fast charge recombination. Rationally optimizing the electronic structures of COF to regulate the local charge of active sites precisely is the key point to improving catalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;The interlayer Co-imine N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper-based imine-COFs with distinct electronic moieties for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Amongst, Co/Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TPA-COF exhibited exceptional activity and tunable syngas (CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by various bipyridines. The interlayer Co-imine N motifs on the donor&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-acceptor-donor&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; structure can induce the oriented electron transfer from dual donors to the Co center, promoting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic framework (COF) has attracted increasing interest in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, but it remains a challenge to achieve high conversion efficiency owing to the insufficient active site and fast charge recombination. Rationally optimizing the electronic structures of COF to regulate the local charge of active sites precisely is the key point to improving catalytic performance. Herein, intercalated single Co sites coordinated by imine-N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper-based imine-COFs with distinct electronic moieties via a molecular engineering strategy. It is confirmed that the charge delivery property and local charge distribution of these heterometallic frameworks can be profoundly influenced by electronic structures. Among these featured structures with mixed-state copper clusters, Co/Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TPA-COF stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity and tunable syngas (CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ratio by changing various bipyridines. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that interlayer Co-imine N motifs on the donor&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-acceptor-donor&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; structures facilitate the formation of a highly separated electron-hole state, which effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from dual electron donors to Co centers, achieving an enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and reduction. This work opens up an avenue for the design of high-performance COF-based catalysts for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Tag&#8208;Generation Proximity Labeling Technology for Recording Cellular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an &#8220;in&#8208;situ&#8208;tag&#8208;generation mechanism&#8221; and develop the GalTag technology based on galactose oxidase (GAO) for recording cellular interactions. GAO mounted on bait cells can in situ generate bio&#8208;orthogonal aldehyde tags as interaction reporters on prey cells. GalTag is unique in that it eliminates the need to add tag molecules, resulting in the ability to record bait footprints in three&#8208;dimensional biological solid regions.







Abstract
Obtaining information about cellular interactions is fundamental to the elucidation of physiological and pathological processes. Proximity labeling technologies have been widely used to report cellular interactions in situ; however, the reliance on addition of tag molecules typically restricts their application to regions where tags can readily diffuse, while the application in, for example, solid tissues, is susceptible. Here, we propose an &#8220;in&#8208;situ&#8208;tag&#8208;generation mechanism&#8221; and develop the GalTag technology based on galactose oxidase (GAO) for recording cellular interactions within three&#8208;dimensional biological solid regions. GAO mounted on bait cells can in situ generate bio&#8208;orthogonal aldehyde tags as interaction reporters on prey cells. Using GalTag, we monitored the dynamics of cellular interactions and assessed the targeting ability of engineered cells. In particular, we recorded, for the first time, the footprints of Bacillus Calmette&#8208;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) invasion into the bladder tissue of living mice, providing a valuable perspective to elucidate the anti&#8208;tumor mechanism of BCG.

         <title>Surfactant Directionally Assembled at the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Facilitating Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant&#8208;modified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces have been designed for cathodic catalytic conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Under the application potential conditions, the surfactant undergoes a conformational transition from random distribution to directional assembly. This microenvironmental regulation strategy achieves efficient hydrogenation of HMF and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a promising alternative to conventional thermal processes. Both the catalyst and electrolyte deeply impact the performance. Designing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface remains challenging due to its compositional and structural complexity. Here, we employ the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a reaction model. The typical cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and its analogs are employed as electrolyte additives to tune the interfacial microenvironment, delivering high&#8208;efficiency hydrogenation of HMF and inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The surfactants experience a conformational transformation from stochastic distribution to directional assembly under applied potential. This oriented arrangement hampers the transfer of water molecules to the interface and promotes the enrichment of reactants. In addition, near 100&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) selectivity is achieved, and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the BHMF is improved from 61&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the microenvironmental modulation strategy applies to a range of electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions involving aldehyde substrates. This work paves the way for engineering advanced electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and boosting unsaturated alcohol electrosynthesis efficiency.

         <title>Sequential Selective Dissolution of Coinage Metals in Recyclable Ionic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au can be sequentially dissolved from waste electrical and electronic equipment using green oxidants: aqueous H2O2 and Oxone in biomass&#8208;derived sustainable and recyclable ionic media: lactic acid and deep eutectic solvent made of choline chloride and urea. This sequential one metal &#8211; one method recycling approach closely follows efforts for the security of supply and objectives of circular economy and sustainable development.







Abstract
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au are essential for modern electronics and their recycling from waste materials is becoming increasingly important to guarantee the security of their supply. Designing new sustainable and selective procedures that would substitute currently used processes is crucial. Here, we describe an unprecedented approach for the sequential dissolution of single metals from Cu, Ag, and Au mixtures using biomass&#8208;derived ionic solvents and green oxidants. First, Cu can be selectively dissolved in the presence of Ag and Au with a choline chloride/urea/H2O2 mixture, followed by the dissolution of Ag in lactic acid/H2O2. Finally, the metallic Au, which is not soluble in either solution above, is dissolved in choline chloride/urea/Oxone. Subsequently, the metals were simply and quantitatively recovered from dissolutions, and the solvents were recycled and reused. The applicability of the developed approach was demonstrated by recovering metals from electronic waste substrates such as printed circuit boards, gold fingers, and solar panels. The dissolution reactions and selectivity were explored with different analytical techniques and DFT calculations. We anticipate our approach will pave a new way for the contemporary and sustainable recycling of multi&#8208;metal waste substrates.

         <title>Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril Receptors Function as Solid State Sequestrants for Organic Micropollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In previous work, we showed that water soluble acyclic cucurbit[n]uril hosts function well as in vivo sequestrants for biologically active substances. Herein, we synthesize a series of water insoluble 3,6&#8208;dimethylcatechol walled acyclic CB[n] and demonstrate their function as solid state sequestrants for organic micropollutants.







Abstract
The accumulation of organic micropollutants (OMP) in aquatic systems is a major societal problem that can be addressed by approaches including nanofiltration, flocculation, reverse osmosis and adsorptive methods using insoluble materials (e.g. activated carbon, MOFs, nanocomposites). More recently, polymeric versions of supramolecular hosts (e.g. cyclodextrins, calixarenes, pillararenes) have been investigated as OMP sequestrants. Herein, we report our study of the use of water insoluble dimethylcatechol walled acyclic cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) hosts as solid state sequestrants for a panel of five OMPs. A series of hosts (H1&#8211;H4) were synthesized by reaction of glycoluril oligomer (monomer&#8211;tetramer) with 3,6&#8208;dimethylcatechol and fully characterized by spectroscopic means and x&#8208;ray crystallography. The solid hosts sequester OMPs from water with removal efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% in some cases. The removal efficiencies of the new hosts parallel the known molecular recognition properties of analogous water soluble acyclic CB[n]. OMP uptake by solid host occurs rapidly (&#8776;120&#8197;seconds). Head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison with CB[6] in batch&#8208;mode separation and DARCO activated carbon in flow&#8208;through separation mode show that tetramer derived host (H4) performs very well under identical conditions. The work establishes insoluble acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors as a promising new platform for OMP sequestration.

&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of organic micropollutants (OMP) in aquatic systems is a major societal problem that can be addressed by approaches including nanofiltration, flocculation, reverse osmosis and adsorptive methods using insoluble materials (e.g. activated carbon, MOFs, nanocomposites). More recently, polymeric versions of supramolecular hosts (e.g. cyclodextrins, calixarenes, pillararenes) have been investigated as OMP sequestrants. Herein, we report our study of the use of water insoluble dimethylcatechol walled acyclic cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) hosts as solid state sequestrants for a panel of five OMPs. A series of hosts (&lt;b&gt;H1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;H4&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesized by reaction of glycoluril oligomer (monomer&#8211;tetramer) with 3,6-dimethylcatechol and fully characterized by spectroscopic means and x-ray crystallography. The solid hosts sequester OMPs from water with removal efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% in some cases. The removal efficiencies of the new hosts parallel the known molecular recognition properties of analogous water soluble acyclic CB[n]. OMP uptake by solid host occurs rapidly (&#8776;120&#8197;seconds). Head-to-head comparison with CB[6] in batch-mode separation and DARCO activated carbon in flow-through separation mode show that tetramer derived host (&lt;b&gt;H4)&lt;/b&gt; performs very well under identical conditions. The work establishes insoluble acyclic CB[n]-type receptors as a promising new platform for OMP sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elevated Water Oxidation by Cation Leaching Enabled Tunable Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>

NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 with a spinel structure, activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning, demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity among NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 homologue catalysts in alkaline conditions. The activation of the initially inactive spinel is due to surface reconstruction facilitated by Cr leaching, resulting in a core&#8211;shell structure with cation vacancies. This catalyst shows exceptional activity and stability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at 80&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Water electrolysis is one promising and eco&#8208;friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best&#8208;performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500&#8201;% current density promotion at overpotential &#951;=300&#8197;mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni&#8201;:&#8201;Fe ratio rather than considering the contribution of Cr. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large&#8208;scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

In mixed&#8208;valent systems , an anti&#8208;symmetric motion leads to electron localisation on or electron transfer between the redox centers. In their Research Article (e202404727), Adam &#352;rut, Benjamin&#8197;J. Lear and Vera Krewald et&#8197;al. show that additionally, a symmetric motion is present in bridged systems: it is responsible for the characteristic shape of the inter&#8208;valence charge transfer band. The close relationship between the two motions is represented by one surface being the shadow of the other.

An all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskite featuring a considerable piezochromic range of 232 nm is reported by Guanjun Xiao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406015). The cover picture describes an intriguing pressure&#8208;induced piezochromic behavior in typical Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals by using diamond anvil cell.

Under the action of London dispersion forces, the fluxional intramolecular medium of redox&#8208;active bipartite molecules reorganizes to promote through&#8208;space orbital overlap between electrophoric subunits, allowing the achievement of prototypical cyclomer reductive formation. Overall, this behavior provides an illustration of electrochemistry &#8220;beyond the covalent bond&#8221;, just beyond! Details of this study are reported in the Research Article by &#201;ric Br&#233;mond, Magdal&#233;na Hromadov&#225;, Philippe&#8197;P. Lain&#233; et&#8197;al. (e202406299).

         <title>Halogen, Chalcogen, Pnictogen, and Tetrel Bonding in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis: An Update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments on the use of non&#8208;transient non&#8208;covalent interactions based on elements of groups 14&#8211;17 in organic synthesis and organocatalysis are discussed. While halogen and chalcogen bonding are now clearly established in this area, applications of pnictogen and particularly tetrel bonding are only starting to emerge.







Abstract
The use of noncovalent interactions based on electrophilic halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, or tetrel centers in organocatalysis has gained noticeable attention. Herein, we provide an overview on the most important developments in the last years with a clear focus on experimental studies and on catalysts which act via such non&#8208;transient interactions.

         <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an introduction on the recent progresses made in the field of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for various applications including adsorption/separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and energy storage.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural flexibility, heteroatomic sites, post&#8208;modification ability and high hydrolytic stability have attracted great attention from scientific community. Hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs, as a subclass of Schiff&#8208;base COFs, was firstly reported in 2011 by Yaghi's group and later witnessed prosperous development in various aspects. Their adjustable structures, precise pore channels and plentiful heteroatomic sites of hydrazone&#8208;linked structures possess much potential in diverse applications, for example, adsorption/separation, chemical sensing, catalysis and energy storage, etc. Up to date, the systematic reviews about the reported hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs are still rare. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize their preparation methods, characteristics and related applications, and discuss the opportunity or challenge of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs. We hope this review could provide new insights about hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for exploring more appealing functions or applications.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Applications of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the progress in covalent organic framework nanosheets, with a focus on studies that compare the performance of covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by demonstrating the impact of thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. The applications of CONs in components of batteries, as well as in biomedical applications, sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis are highlighted.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are two&#8208;dimensional, crystalline porous framework materials with numerous scopes for tunability, such as porosity, functionality, stability and aspect ratio (thickness to length ratio). The manipulation of &#960;&#8208;stacking in COFs results in truly 2D materials, namely covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), adds advantages in many applications. In this Minireview, we have discussed both top&#8208;down (COFs&#8594;CONs) and bottom&#8208;up (molecules&#8594;CONs) approaches with precise information on thickness and lateral growth. We have showcased the research progress on CONs in a few selected applications, such as batteries, catalysis, sensing and biomedical applications. This Minireview specifically highlights the reports where the authors compare the performance of CONs with COFs by demonstrating the impact of the thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. We have also provided the possible scope of exploration of CONs research in terms of inter&#8208;dimensional conversion, such as graphene to carbon nanotube and future technologies.

         <title>Stereoinvertive SN1 Through Neighboring Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel classification for stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution through neighboring group participation is presented. Three disctinct modes have been identified: Inversion via Rearrangements, Invertive Intermediate&#8208;Retentive Ring&#8208;opening and Retentive Intermediate&#8208;Invertive Substitution. In each instance, we have elucidated the fundamental principles underlying the stereochemistry and provided representative examples to illustrate the concepts.







Abstract
Neighboring group participation, the assistance of non&#8208;conjugated electrons to a reaction center, is a fundamental phenomenon in chemistry. In the framework of nucleophilic substitution reactions, neighboring group participation is known to cause rate acceleration, first order kinetics (SN1), and retention of configuration. The latter phenomenon is a result of double inversion: the first one when the neighboring group displaces the leaving group, and the second when a nucleophile substitutes the neighboring group. This powerful control of stereoretention has been widely used in organic synthesis for more than a century. However, neighboring group participation may also lead to inversion of configuration, a phenomenon which is often overlooked. Herein, we review this unique mode of stereoinversion, dividing the relevant reactions into three classes with the aim to introduce a fresh perspective on the different modes of stereoinversion via neighboring group participation as well as the factors that control this stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Strained Amino Acids by a PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme through Cryptic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogenases enable organisms to alter the reactivity of a biological substrate by enzymatically installing a leaving group. In this communication, we discover a bacterial gene cluster which uses a pyridoxal 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme to form strained carbocyclic amino acids from halogenated substrates. We also examine the role of the non&#8208;canonical amino acid pazamine in plant&#8208;bacterial interactions.







Abstract
Amino acids (AAs) are modular building blocks which nature uses to synthesize both macromolecules, such as proteins, and small molecule natural products, such as alkaloids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides. While the 20 main proteinogenic AAs display relatively limited side chain diversity, a wide range of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) exist that are not used by the ribosome for protein synthesis, but contain a broad array of structural features and functional groups. In this communication, we report the discovery of the biosynthetic pathway for a new ncAA, pazamine, which contains a cyclopropane ring formed in two steps. In the first step, a chlorine is added onto the C4 position of lysine by a radical halogenase, PazA. The cyclopropane ring is then formed in the next step by a pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme, PazB, via an SN2&#8208;like attack at C4 to eliminate chloride. Genetic studies of this pathway in the native host, Pseudomonas azotoformans, show that pazamine potentially inhibits ethylene biosynthesis in growing plants based on alterations in the root phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We further show that PazB can be utilized to make an alternative cyclobutane&#8208;containing AA. These discoveries may lead to advances in biocatalytic production of specialty chemicals and agricultural biotechnology.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Construction of Nitrogen Stereogenic Center via Formal Desymmetrization of Remote Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>

An ionic hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted carbene organocatalytic approach to afford a wide range of chiral N(V)&#8208;stereogenic N&#8208;oxide products is disclosed by formal desymmetrization of remote diols.







Abstract
The control of noncarbon stereogenic centers is of profound importance owing to their enormous interest in bioactive compounds and chiral catalyst or ligand design for enantioselective synthesis. Despite various elegant approaches have been achieved for construction of S&#8208;, P&#8208;, Si&#8208; and B&#8208;stereocenters over the past decades, the catalyst&#8208;controlled strategies to govern the formation of N&#8208;stereogenic compounds have garnered less attention. Here, we disclose the first organocatalytic approach for efficient access to a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;stereogenic compounds through a desymmetrization approach. Intriguingly, the pro&#8208;chiral remote diols, which are previously not well addressed with enantiocontrol, are well differentiated by potent chiral carbene&#8208;bound acyl azolium intermediates. Preliminary studies shed insights on the critical importance of the ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) formed between the dimer aggregate of diols to afford the chiral N&#8208;oxide products that feature a tetrahedral nitrogen as the sole stereogenic element with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, the chiral N&#8208;oxide products could offer an attractive strategy for chiral ligand design and discovery of potential antibacterial agrochemicals.

         <title>Unimolecular Chemiexcited Oxygenation of Pathogenic Amyloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid degradation without photoirradiation. Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;X, are chemiexcited through autoxidation, leading to amyloid&#8208;selective oxygenation in the dark. Oxygenated A&#946; furnishes reduced aggregation potency and cytotoxicity. The chemiexcitation strategy may be effective in treating amyloidosis by alleviating pathogenetic amyloids accumulated deep in the brain, where light hardly reaches.







Abstract
Pathogenic protein aggregates, called amyloids, are etiologically relevant to various diseases, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Catalytic photooxygenation of amyloids, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), reduces their toxicity; however, the requirement for light irradiation may limit its utility in large animals, including humans, due to the low tissue permeability of light. Here, we report that Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;Cl and dmCLA&#8208;Br, promoted selective oxygenation of amyloids through chemiexcitation without external light irradiation. Further structural optimization of dmCLA&#8208;Cl led to the identification of a derivative with a polar carboxylate functional group and low cellular toxicity: dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid. dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid promoted oxygenation of A&#946; amyloid and reduced its cellular toxicity without photoirradiation. The chemiexcited oxygenation developed in this study may be an effective approach to neutralizing the toxicity of amyloids, which can accumulate deep inside the body, and treating amyloidosis.

         <title>H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;Derived Chiral &#951;6&#8208;Benzene Ligands: New Opportunities for the Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene ligands has been developed, which can coordinate with ruthenium(II) highly site&#8208;selectively.The related chiral ruthenium(II) catalysts proved highly effective for the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a series of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Given the tremendous success of (p&#8208;cymene)RuII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20&#8197;years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the tremendous success of (p-cymene)Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20&#8197;years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)-catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, it has rarely been achieved due to the severe difficulty in developing proper chiral Ben ligands. In particular, designing chiral Ben ligands by connecting a benzene fragment to a chiral framework including benzene rings remained an unsolved challenge until this effort. Here we present a novel class of axially chiral Ben ligands derived from readily available (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;-octahydro-1,1&#8242;-bi-2-naphthol ((&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-BINOL) in 4&#8211;8 steps.

         <title>Engineered Phenylalanine Ammonia&#8208;Lyases for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Aspartic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based engineering of phenylalanine ammonia&#8208;lyase from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL) is conducted for preparative&#8208;scale enantioselective hydroaminations of previously inaccessible yet synthetically useful substrates, such as amide&#8208; and ester&#8208;containing fumaric acid derivatives. Our engineered PbPALs exhibit exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, high enantioselectivity, and broad substrate scope. The potential utility of the developed biocatalysts is demonstrated by a preparative&#8208;scale hydroamination yielding tert&#8208;butyl protected l&#8208;aspartic acid, widely used as intermediate in peptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis.







Abstract
Biocatalytic hydroamination of alkenes is an efficient and selective method to synthesize natural and unnatural amino acids. Phenylalanine ammonia&#8208;lyases (PALs) have been previously engineered to access a range of substituted phenylalanines and heteroarylalanines, but their substrate scope remains limited, typically including only arylacrylic acids. Moreover, the enantioselectivity in the hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient substrates is often poor. Here, we report the structure&#8208;based engineering of PAL from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL), enabling preparative&#8208;scale enantioselective hydroaminations of previously inaccessible yet synthetically useful substrates, such as amide&#8208; and ester&#8208;containing fumaric acid derivatives. Through the elucidation of cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) PbPAL structure and screening of the structure&#8208;based mutagenesis library, we identified the key active site residue L205 as pivotal for dramatically enhancing the enantioselectivity of hydroamination reactions involving electron&#8208;deficient substrates. Our engineered PALs demonstrated exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, high enantioselectivity, and broad substrate scope. The potential utility of the developed biocatalysts was further demonstrated by a preparative&#8208;scale hydroamination yielding tert&#8208;butyl protected l&#8208;aspartic acid, widely used as intermediate in peptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis.

         <title>A General Strategy for Sustainable 3D Printing Based on A Multifunctional Photoinitiator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional photoinitiator that offers precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation (450&#8197;nm) and material degradation (365&#8197;nm) is developed. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured. Furthermore, this photoinitiator facilitates the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures. This represents a promising general strategy for the development of recyclable photoresins for 3D printing.







Abstract
A multifunctional photoinitiator is presented, offering precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation at 450&#8197;nm and material degradation at 365&#8197;nm. This is accomplished by covalently linking photoactive bis(acyl)phosphane oxide and photocleavable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ether moieties onto the surface of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured, exhibiting superior mechanical properties compared to the pristine material. Moreover, this photoinitiator enables the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures, representing a promising general strategy for developing recyclable photoresins for 3D printing applications.

The Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported, giving Z&#8208;alkene products in &gt;95&#8201;% ee and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E. Protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is likely the slow step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer with MeOH.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate arylations of electron&#8208;poor alkenes are highly selective processes for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. &#948;&#8208;Selective hydroarylations of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes are less well developed and reactions that deliver high enantioselectivity while giving single alkene isomer products are elusive. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes that gives nearly exclusive Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products (generally with &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 positional and geometrical selectivity). This remote functionalization provides access to chiral diarylated alkenes from readily available precursors poised for further functionalization, including in the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is the turnover limiting step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer pathway.

         <title>Polymeric Prodrugs using Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Prolonged Local Anesthesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrodotoxin (TTX) polymeric prodrugs were developed utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry. The reversible reaction between the 1,2&#8197;diol on TTX and phenylboronic acid enabled ex vivo TTX encapsulation with high efficiency (EE%, &gt;90&#8201;%) and sustained TTX release in vivo. The resultant TTX sustained release depots induced prolonged local anesthesia with minimal systemic toxicity.







Abstract
Depot&#8208;type drug delivery systems are designed to deliver drugs at an effective rate over an extended period. Minimizing initial &#8220;burst&#8221; can also be important, especially with drugs causing systemic toxicity. Both goals are challenging with small hydrophilic molecules. The delivery of molecules such as the ultrapotent local anesthetic tetrodotoxin (TTX) exemplifies both challenges. Toxicity can be mitigated by conjugating TTX to polymers with ester bonds, but the slow ester hydrolysis can result in subtherapeutic TTX release. Here, we developed a prodrug strategy, based on dynamic covalent chemistry utilizing a reversible reaction between the diol TTX and phenylboronic acids. These polymeric prodrugs exhibited TTX encapsulation efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% and the resulting polymeric nanoparticles showed a range of TTX release rates. In vivo injection of the TTX polymeric prodrugs at the sciatic nerve reduced TTX systemic toxicity and produced nerve block lasting 9.7&#177;2.0&#8197;h, in comparison to 1.6&#177;0.6&#8197;h from free TTX. This approach could also be used to co&#8208;deliver the diol dexamethasone, which prolonged nerve block to 21.8&#177;5.1&#8197;h. This work emphasized the usefulness of dynamic covalent chemistry for depot&#8208;type drug delivery systems with slow and effective drug release kinetics.

The resultant TTX sustained release depots induced prolonged local anesthesia with minimal systemic toxicity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depot-type drug delivery systems are designed to deliver drugs at an effective rate over an extended period. Minimizing initial &#8220;burst&#8221; can also be important, especially with drugs causing systemic toxicity. Both goals are challenging with small hydrophilic molecules. The delivery of molecules such as the ultrapotent local anesthetic tetrodotoxin (TTX) exemplifies both challenges. Toxicity can be mitigated by conjugating TTX to polymers with ester bonds, but the slow ester hydrolysis can result in subtherapeutic TTX release. Here, we developed a prodrug strategy, based on dynamic covalent chemistry utilizing a reversible reaction between the diol TTX and phenylboronic acids. These polymeric prodrugs exhibited TTX encapsulation efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% and the resulting polymeric nanoparticles showed a range of TTX release rates. In vivo injection of the TTX polymeric prodrugs at the sciatic nerve reduced TTX systemic toxicity and produced nerve block lasting 9.7&#177;2.0&#8197;h, in comparison to 1.6&#177;0.6&#8197;h from free TTX. This approach could also be used to co-deliver the diol dexamethasone, which prolonged nerve block to 21.8&#177;5.1&#8197;h. This work emphasized the usefulness of dynamic covalent chemistry for depot-type drug delivery systems with slow and effective drug release kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals from Organoboron Reagents Enabled by Pulsed Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed electrosynthesis efficiently converts aromatic organoboron reagents to aryl radicals. Mechanistic studies reveal that pulsed electrosynthesis overcomes challenges like radical grafting/passivation, homocoupling, overoxidation, and decomposition. This electro&#8208;oxidative method enables straightforward functionalization of aromatic organoboron reagents to form aryl C&#8722;P, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds.







Abstract
Aryl radicals play a pivotal role as reactive intermediates in chemical synthesis, commonly arising from aryl halides and aryl diazo compounds. Expanding the repertoire of sources for aryl radical generation to include abundant and stable organoboron reagents would significantly advance radical chemistry and broaden their reactivity profile. While traditional approaches utilize stoichiometric oxidants or photocatalysis to generate aryl radicals from these reagents, electrochemical conditions have been largely underexplored. Through rigorous mechanistic investigations, we identified fundamental challenges hindering aryl radical generation. In addition to the high oxidation potentials of aromatic organoboron compounds, electrode passivation through radical grafting, homocoupling of aryl radicals, and decomposition issues were identified. We demonstrate that pulsed electrosynthesis enables selective and efficient aryl radical generation by mitigating the fundamental challenges. Our discoveries facilitated the development of the first electrochemical conversion of aryl potassium trifluoroborate salts into aryl C&#8722;P bonds. This sustainable and straightforward oxidative electrochemical approach exhibited a broad substrate scope, accommodating various heterocycles and aryl chlorides, typical substrates in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Furthermore, we extended this methodology to form aryl C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds, showcasing its versatility and potential in bond formation processes.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Phenethylamine Synthesis: N&#8208;Pyridinium Aziridines as Latent Dual Electrophiles</title>

N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines serve as latent dual electrophiles for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines. Ni&#8208;catalyzed aziridine ring opening with organozinc nucleophiles affords a diverse family of &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts which upon reductive N&#8722;N cleavage provides access to rapid and modular molecular assembly of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Phenethylamines are widely represented in biologically and pharmacologically active organic small molecules. Here, we introduce N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines as latent dual electrophiles for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines. Bromide&#8208;promoted ring opening generates &#946;&#8208;halopyridinium amines. Selective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling between organozinc nucleophiles and the benzylic C&#8722;Br electrophile affords a diverse family of &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts, and coupling is stereoconvergent in the presence of chiral ligands. Subsequent Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive N&#8722;N bond activation within the &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts furnishes the products of formal olefin carboamination. Other reductive N&#8722;N cleavage reactions are demonstrated to provide access to free primary amines, alkylated amines, heterocycles, and products derived from N&#8208;centered radical chemistry. The developed reaction sequence can be implemented in the context of complex molecules and natural product derivatives. Together, the described results provide a general and modular synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines and significantly expand the utility of N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines as linchpins in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Strong Swelling and Symmetrization in Siliceous Zeolites due to Hydrogen Insertion at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to other atoms or molecules, H2 enters both the pores and the framework cages of siliceous zeolites under high pressure. This results in strong swelling and symmetrization of the structures with very high hydrogen contents of 1.5&#8211;1.7 H2 molecules/SiO2 unit being obtained.







Abstract
Hydrogen and helium saturate the 1D pore systems of the high&#8208;silica (Si/Al&gt;30) zeolites Theta&#8208;One (TON), and Mobile&#8208;Twelve (MTW) at high pressure based on x&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations. In TON, a strong 22&#8201;% volume increase occurs above 5&#8197;GPa with a transition from the collapsed P21 to a symmetrical, swelled Cmc21 form linked to an increase in H2 content from 12 H2/unit cell in the pores to 35 H2/unit cell in the pores and in the framework of the material. No transition and continuous collapse of TON is observed in helium indicating that the mechanism of H2 insertion is distinct from other fluids. The insertion of hydrogen in the larger pores of MTW results in a strong 11&#8201;% volume increase at 4.3&#8197;GPa with partial symmetrization followed by a second volume increase of 4.5&#8201;% at 7.5&#8197;GPa, corresponding to increases in hydrogen content from 43 to 67 and then to 93 H2/unit cell. Flexible 1D siliceous zeolites have a very high H2 capacity (1.5 and 1.7 H2/SiO2 unit for TON and MTW, respectively) due to H2 insertion in the pores and the framework, in contrast to other atoms and molecules, thereby providing a mechanism for strong swelling.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent and Covalent Binding of New Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;like Polyoxidovanadate Clusters to Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In NaCl solutions and in the presence of lysozyme, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] undergoes ligand exchange, partial oxidation of VIV to VV producing unexpected mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates with composition [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722;, which bind covalently and non&#8208;covalently to the protein surface.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of the model protein lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] from crystals grown in 1.1&#8197;M NaCl, 0.1&#8197;M sodium acetate at pH&#8197;4.0 reveal the binding to the protein of different and unexpected mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, which non&#8208;covalently interacts with the lysozyme surface, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722; (this latter based on an unusual {V18O43} cage) which covalently bind the protein. EPR spectroscopy confirms the partial oxidation of VIV to VV and the formation of mixed&#8208;valence species. The results indicate that the interaction with proteins can stabilize the structure of unexpected &#8211; both for dimension and architecture &#8211; POVs, not observed in aqueous solution.

&lt;p&gt;The high-resolution X-ray structures of the model protein lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug [V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(acetylacetonato)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] from crystals grown in 1.1&#8197;M NaCl, 0.1&#8197;M sodium acetate at pH&#8197;4.0 reveal the binding to the protein of different and unexpected mixed-valence cage-like polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which non-covalently interacts with the lysozyme surface, [V&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [V&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;51&lt;/sub&gt;(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (this latter based on an unusual {V&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;43&lt;/sub&gt;} cage) which covalently bind the protein. EPR spectroscopy confirms the partial oxidation of V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; to V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; and the formation of mixed-valence species. The results indicate that the interaction with proteins can stabilize the structure of unexpected &#8211; both for dimension and architecture &#8211; POVs, not observed in aqueous solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Activation of N&#8208;Nitrosamides with Red Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release via Mediated Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mediated electron transfer (MET) is fundamental to many biological functions, including cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and enzymatic catalysis. However, leveraging the MET process to enable the release of therapeutic gases has been largely unexplored. Herein, we report the bio&#8208;inspired activation of a series of UV&#8208;absorbing N&#8208;nitrosamide derivatives (NOA) under red light exposure, enabling the quantitative release of nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitter via an MET process. The cornerstone of our design is the covalent linkage of a 2,4&#8208;dinitroaniline moiety, which acts as an electron mediator to the N&#8208;nitrosamide groups. This facilitates efficient electron transfer from the excited palladium(II) meso&#8208;tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) photocatalyst and the selective activation of NOA. Our approach has been validated with distinct photocatalysts and various N&#8208;nitrosamides, including those derived from carbamates, amides, and ureas. Notably, the modulation of the linker length between the electron mediator and N&#8208;nitrosamide groups serves as a regulatory mechanism for controlling NO release kinetics. Moreover, this biomimetic NO release platform demonstrates effective operation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it enables localized delivery of NO under physiological conditions, exhibiting significant anticancer efficacy within the phototherapeutic window and enhanced selectivity towards tumor cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Overall 99% (002) Plane Achieves Extreme and Direct Utilization of 95% Zn Anode and By&#8208;Product as Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn anode protection in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) face great challenges of high Zn utilization rate (i.e., depth of discharge, DOD) and high current density due to the large difficulty in obtaining an extreme overall RTC (relative texture coefficient) of Zn (002) plane. Through the potent interaction of Mn(III)aq and H+ with distinct Zn crystal planes under an electric field, large&#8208;size Zn foils with a breakthrough (002) plane RTC of 99% (i.e., close to Zn single crystal) are electrodeposited on texture&#8208;less substrates, which is also applicable from recycled Zn. The ultra&#8208;high (002) plane RTC remarkably enhances cyclic performance of the Zn anode (70% DOD @ 45.5 mA cm&#8208;2), and the DOD is even up to 95% (@ 28.1 mA cm&#8208;2) with an electrolyte additive of polyaniline. Furthermore, MnO2, the by&#8208;product of electrodeposition, is directly used as cathode of both coin cell and pouch battery, surpassing the cyclic performance exhibited by the majority of Zn||MnO2 batteries in previous instances. These results demonstrate the great potential of our strategy for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thorium, a predominant actinide in the Earth's crust, presents significant environmental and health risks due to its radioactive nature. These risks are particularly pronounced during the mining and processing of monazite for rare earth elements (REEs), which contain substantial thorium concentrations. Current instrumental analysis methods for thorium, offer high accuracy but require laborious sample preparation and expensive instruments, making them unsuitable for on&#8208;site analysis. Herein, we present a class of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as fluorochromic sensors for Th4+ cations. Utilizing a heterobimetallic Eu3+/Tb3+ doping strategy, the luminescence colors of EuxTb1&#8211;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH can be finely tuned from red, to orange, and to green. More intriguingly, the higher Lewis acidity of Th4+ facilitates the transformation of EuxTb1&#8211;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH into a UiO&#8208;type Th&#8208;MOF via a dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism. This process results in a gradual reduction of characteristic Ln3+ emissions and the emergence of blue color ligand&#8208;based fluorescence, thereby leading to selective fluorochromic responses with increasing Th4+ concentrations and enabling visible detection of Th4+ cations. Additionally, a custom&#8208;built portable optoelectronic device was fabricated, which directly converts luminescence colors into red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) values. This device enables easy quantification of Th4+ concentrations without the need for complex instrumentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilithium tetraalkinyl palladates formed in situ from palladium salts and lithium alkynyls effectively promote the coupling of non&#8208;activated aryl chlorides with various nucleophiles with C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation. The applicability of the protocol has been demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The lithium alkinyls act as highly electron rich ligands that seem to be widely inert under the basic reaction conditions.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings of aryl chlorides usually call for bulky, electron&#8208;rich ligands such as phosphines or heterocyclic carbenes. We have now found that similarly powerful cross&#8208;coupling catalysts are obtained by the reaction of palladium salts with alkynyllithium reagents. The species initially formed in this process was characterized as a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate complex. It catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with the lithium salts of various terminal alkynes to give alkynyl arenes. The isolated Li&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Pd complex also efficiently promotes the reaction of aryl, and allyl chlorides with (hetero)aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208;, and allyllithium compounds as well as lithium amides. None of these reactions proceeded in the presence of palladium salts alone. The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49&#8197;molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

     alt="Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilithium tetraalkinyl palladates formed in situ from palladium salts and lithium alkynyls effectively promote the coupling of non-activated aryl chlorides with various nucleophiles with C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation. The applicability of the protocol has been demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The lithium alkinyls act as highly electron rich ligands that seem to be widely inert under the basic reaction conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings of aryl chlorides usually call for bulky, electron-rich ligands such as phosphines or heterocyclic carbenes. We have now found that similarly powerful cross-coupling catalysts are obtained by the reaction of palladium salts with alkynyllithium reagents. The species initially formed in this process was characterized as a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate complex. It catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with the lithium salts of various terminal alkynes to give alkynyl arenes. The isolated Li-alkynyl-Pd complex also efficiently promotes the reaction of aryl, and allyl chlorides with (hetero)aryl-, alkyl-, and allyllithium compounds as well as lithium amides. None of these reactions proceeded in the presence of palladium salts alone. The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49&#8197;molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Understanding Hydroxide Diffusion Mechanism in Anion Exchange Membranes during Electrochemical Processes with RDAnalyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to analyze and decouple hydroxide diffusion mechanism in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) during electrochemical processes. Our simulations show that the majority of hydroxides follow the associated Grotthuss diffusion mechanism in the model system.







Abstract
Enhancing the understanding of hydroxide transport mechanisms in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is beneficial for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs in the renewable energy system. However, the high complexity and lack of adequate analytic tools make it challenging to clarify different mechanisms unambiguously. Herein, we developed an in&#8208;house toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to conduct an effective analysis of hydroxide diffusion mechanisms from ReaxFF molecular dynamic simulations. Using the experimentally well&#8208;synthesized T20NC6NC5N as a model system, we successfully decoupled the hydroxide diffusion mechanisms into free Vehicular and free Grotthuss, as well as associated Vehicular and associated Grotthuss, which was not yet achieved previously. Meanwhile, RDAnalyzer managed to specifically identify the drift length of hydroxide species for each mechanism under the electric field, which worked as a useful variable for calculating the conductivity of AEMs. Our theoretically predicted conductivity for T20NC6NC5N agrees reasonably with experimental results, indicating the reliability of RDAnalyzer. This work not only provides a rational understanding of the complex hydroxide diffusion mechanisms in AEMs but also holds the potential to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs with computations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi&#8208;Pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by copper peptides in human plasma, we designed a ferrocene&#8208;capped self&#8208;assembling peptide, FcGH. It can self&#8208;assemble through two different pathways: spontaneous self&#8208;assembly and Cu2+&#8208;induced. By controlling the amount of Cu2+ added, these pathways can form adjustable assembly morphologies and generate different biological effects.







Abstract
Although self&#8208;assembly has emerged as an effective tool for fabricating biomaterials, achieving precise control over the morphologies and functionalities of the resultant assemblies remains an ongoing challenge. Inspired by the copper peptide naturally present in human plasma, in this study, we designed a synthetic precursor, FcGH. FcGH can self&#8208;assemble via two distinct pathways: spontaneous and Cu2+&#8208;induced. These two assembly pathways enabled the formation of assemblies with tunable morphologies by adjusting the amount of added Cu2+. We found that the nanoparticles formed by Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency than the wormlike fibers formed spontaneously. Moreover, this Cu2+&#8208;induced assembly process occurred spontaneously at a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Cu2+ to FcGH, avoiding the excessive use of Cu2+ and a tedious preparation procedure. By co&#8208;assembling with 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)&#8208;conjugated FcGH, Cu2+&#8208;induced supramolecular nanodrugs elicited multiple cell death modalities in cancer cells with elevated immunogenicity, enhancing the therapeutic effect compared to free HCPT. This study highlights Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly as an efficient tool for directing the assembly of nanodrugs and for synergistic tumor therapy.

         <title>Identification and Characterization of Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent Lyases with an Unusual CDG Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical sequence GDG(X)24&#8208;27N, is the fingerprint of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We have characterized a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE) with an unusual cysteine replacing the first glycine of this motif. We unravel an unexpected function for the atypical cysteine and establish JanthE for valuable biocatalytic applications and as a model for mechanistic studies.







Abstract
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical GDG(X)24&#8208;27N sequence, is highly conserved among ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We investigated a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE from Janthinobacterium sp. HH01) with an unusual cysteine (C458) replacing the first glycine of this motif. JanthE exhibits a high substrate promiscuity and accepts long aliphatic &#945;&#8208;keto acids as donors. Sterically hindered aromatic aldehydes or non&#8208;activated ketones are acceptor substrates, giving access to a variety of secondary and tertiary alcohols as carboligation products. The crystal structure solved at a resolution of 1.9&#8197;&#197; reveals that C458 is not primarily involved in cofactor binding as previously thought for the canonical glycine. Instead, it coordinates methionine 406, thus ensuring the integrity of the active site and the enzyme activity. In addition, we have determined the long&#8208;sought genuine tetrahedral intermediates formed with pyruvate and 2&#8208;oxobutyrate in the pre&#8208;decarboxylation states and deciphered the atomic details for their stabilization in the active site. Collectively, we unravel an unexpected role for the first residue of the ThDP&#8208;binding motif and unlock a family of lyases that can perform valuable carboligation reactions.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of the Structural Analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 in the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 establish a solid foundation for designing highly efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts and offer new insights into the mechanism of CO2 activity at the atomic level.







Abstract
Owing to the significant attention directed toward alloy metal nanoclusters, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their structures and their performance during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and discover potential synergistic effects for the design of novel functional nanoclusters. However, a lack of suitable analogs makes this investigation challenging. In this study, we synthesized a well&#8208;defined pair of structural analogs, [Au8Cu1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ and [Au8Ag1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ (Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1, respectively), and characterized them. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au8M1 (M=Cu/Ag) consists of a tetrahedral Au3M1 core capped by three (Dppm)Au staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, one lone SR ligand, and a terminal Cl ligand. Ag and Cu were doped at the same site in the Au8M1 nanoclusters, which has rarely been reported. Au8Cu1 exhibited a significantly higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO; ~82.2&#8201;%) during eCO2RR than that of Au8Ag1 (FECO; ~33.1&#8201;%). Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that *COOH is the key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The formation of *COOH on Au8Cu1 is more thermodynamically stable than on Au8Ag1, and Au8Cu1 shows a smaller *CO formation energy than that on Au8Ag1, which promotes the reduction of CO2. We believe that the structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 offer a suitable template for the in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;property correlations at the atomic level.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bltter&#8208;pyr radical/cobalt interface is investigated. We found that changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allows screening, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces in view of their potential applications in spintronics.







Abstract
In this work, we study the interface obtained by depositing a monolayer of a Blatter radical derivative on polycrystalline cobalt. By examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X&#8208;ray techniques, combined with electronic structure calculations, we could simultaneously determine the electronic structure of both the molecular and ferromagnetic sides of the interface, thus obtaining a full understanding of the interfacial magnetic properties. We found that the molecule is strongly hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allowed us to screen, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces given their potential applications in spintronics.

         <title>Pyridazine&#8208;Promoted Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Exceptional Capability of Stepwise Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two COFs with non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages were successfully constructed using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine in Knoevenagel condensation, with high crystallinity, large surface areas, and finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;channels decorated with substantial cis&#8208;azo moieties, which exhibited exceptionally stepwise water uptake capacity.







Abstract
In this study, we successfully developed two novel vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine through Knoevenagel condensation. These COFs featured finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;scale pore sizes, high surface areas and stable non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages. Finely resolved powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns demonstrated highly crystalline structures with a hexagonal lattice in the AA layer stacking. The resulting one&#8208;dimensional channels possess strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting sites arising from the decorated cis&#8208;azo/azine units with two pairs of fully exposed lone pair electrons, endowing the as&#8208;prepared COFs with exceptional water absorption properties. The g&#8208;DZPH&#8208;COF exhibited successive steep water uptake steps starting from low relative pressures (P/PSTA=0.1), with the remarkable water uptake capacity of 0.26&#8197;g/g at P/PSTA=0.2 (25&#8201;&#176;C), which is the optimal value recorded among the reported COFs. Dynamic vapour sorption measurements revealed the fast kinetics of these COFs, even in the cluster formation process. Water uptake and release cycling tests demonstrated their outstanding hydrolytic stability, durability, and adsorption&#8211;desorption retention ability.

         <title>Steering Geometric Reconstruction of Bismuth with Accelerated Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of elemental Cl into Bi19Cl3S27 significantly accelerates the electrochemical reconstruction process, inducing the formation of bismuth nanosheets with abundant vacancy defects. These Bi vacancies can aggregate electron density and enhance the adsorption of key intermediates *OCHO, thereby facilitating the production of formate.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy&#8208;rich defects (V&#8208;Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, experimental tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V&#8208;Bi NS exhibits up to 96&#8201;% HCOO&#8722; Faraday efficiency and 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 HCOO&#8722; partial current densities, and its electrochemical active surface area normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2&#8197;times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I&#8208;Bi NS). Density functional theory calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron&#8208;rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2&#8722; radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.

         <title>Structural Mapping of Protein Aggregates in Live Cells Modeling Huntington's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of live Mid&#8208;infrared Photothermal (MIP) Imaging to study protein aggregates in a S. cerevisiae model of Huntington's Disease. MIP enables to distinguish structurally different partitions of aggregates of the protein huntingtin, by scanning across the aggregate and analyzing their MIP amide I band. We revealed that huntingtin aggregates are organized in a &#946;&#8208;sheet rich amyloid core and a shell composed of &#945;&#8208;helical proteins.







Abstract
While protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, acquiring structural information on protein aggregates inside live cells remains challenging. Traditional microscopy does not provide structural information on protein systems. Routinely used fluorescent protein tags, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), might perturb native structures. Here, we report a counter&#8208;propagating mid&#8208;infrared photothermal imaging approach enabling mapping of secondary structure of protein aggregates in live cells modeling Huntington's disease. By comparing mid&#8208;infrared photothermal spectra of label&#8208;free and GFP&#8208;tagged huntingtin inclusions, we demonstrate that GFP fusions indeed perturb the secondary structure of aggregates. By implementing spectra with small spatial step for dissecting spectral features within sub&#8208;micrometer distances, we reveal that huntingtin inclusions partition into a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich core and a &#593;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich shell. We further demonstrate that this structural partition exists only in cells with the [RNQ+] prion state, while [rnq&#8722;] cells only carry smaller &#946;&#8208;rich non&#8208;toxic aggregates. Collectively, our methodology has the potential to unveil detailed structural information on protein assemblies in live cells, enabling high&#8208;throughput structural screenings of macromolecular assemblies.

         <title>Dynamics of the Boundary Layer in Pulsed CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While numerous experimental investigations underscore the efficacy of pulsed CO2 electrolysis in enhancing productivity, selectivity, and stability, elucidating the underlying mechanisms remains an intricate challenge. However, modeling the boundary layer, assuming steric ion effects and non&#8208;electroneutral conditions, allows us to illuminate dynamic reorganization within the electrode microenvironment.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the field, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today's limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy efficiency when pulsing between &#8722;1.85 and &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by diffusion and not from pH&#8208;induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83&#8201;% compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation.

     alt="Dynamics of the Boundary Layer in Pulsed CO2 Electrolysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While numerous experimental investigations underscore the efficacy of pulsed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis in enhancing productivity, selectivity, and stability, elucidating the underlying mechanisms remains an intricate challenge. However, modeling the boundary layer, assuming steric ion effects and non-electroneutral conditions, allows us to illuminate dynamic reorganization within the electrode microenvironment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the field, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis beyond today's limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy efficiency when pulsing between &#8722;1.85 and &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by diffusion and not from pH-induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83&#8201;% compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Hydrogen Atom Transfers for Assembly of Multi&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H Cyclopentanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H cyclopentanones. The strengths are multiple including green aspects (atom&#8208;economy, photocatalysis, continuous microflow synthesis). Each step of the reaction mechanism was deciphered by DFT calculations. This work expands the scope of possibilities, which means gaining access to novel fluorinated scaffolds for biological evaluation.







Abstract
A photocatalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed to construct original polysubstituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 cyclopentanones in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This building block approach leverages trifluoromethylthio alkynes and branched/linear aldehydes, as readily available reaction partners, in consecutive hydrogen atom transfers and C&#8722;C bond formations. Difluoromethylthio alkynes are also compatible substrates. Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale&#8208;up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to support a radical&#8208;mediated cascade process.

         <title>Ion Current Rectification Activity Induced by Boron Hydride Nanosheets to Enhance Magnesium Analgesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic MgB2 nanoparticles are found with potent analgesia, surpassing the efficacy of the clinical MgSO4 and morphine. In pathological environments, MgB2 undergoes hydrolysis, forming borohydride (BH). BH characterized by semimetallic properties and delocalized pi electrons, can alter the behaviors of Na+ and K+ around neurons via pi&#8208;cation interactions, significantly enhancing the magnesium analgesia.







Abstract
The limited analgesic efficiency of magnesium restricts its application in pain management. Here, we report boron hydride (BH) with ion currents rectification activity that can enhance the analgesic efficiency of magnesium without the risks of drug tolerance or addiction. We synthesize MgB2, comprising hexagonal boron sheets alternating with Mg2+. In pathological environment, Mg2+ is exchanged by H+, forming two&#8208;dimensional borophene&#8208;analogue BH sheets. BH interacts with the charged cations via cation&#8208;pi interaction, leading to dynamic modulation of sodium and potassium ion currents around neurons. Additionally, released Mg2+ competes Ca2+ to inhibit its influx and neuronal excitation. In vitro cultured dorsal root neurons show a remarkable increase in threshold potential from the normal &#8722;35.9&#8197;mV to &#8722;5.9&#8197;mV after the addition of MgB2, indicating potent analgesic effect. In three typical pain models, including CFA&#8208;induced inflammatory pain, CINP&#8208; or CCI&#8208;induced neuropathic pain, MgB2 exhibits analgesic efficiency approximately 2.23, 3.20, and 2.0&#8197;times higher than clinical MgSO4, respectively, and even about 1.04, 1.66, and 1.95&#8197;times higher than morphine, respectively. The development of magnesium based intermetallic compounds holds promise in addressing the non&#8208;opioid medical need for pain relief.

         <title>Modifying Proton Relay into Bioinspired Dye&#8208;Based Coordination Polymer for Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural PCET enzymes, proton&#8208;relay containing dye&#8208;based coordination polymer, H+@In&#8722;AQ, was constructed as potent photocatalytic PCET mediator for both oxidative and reductive PCET, exhibiting the elevated reactivities and special selectivity in photocatalytic PCET&#8208;activation of inert bonds to furnish the conversions with pharmaceutical interests. @ZhangTiexin







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) imparts an energetic advantage over single electron transfer in activating inert substances. Natural PCET enzyme catalysis generally requires tripartite preorganization of proton relay, substrate&#8208;bound active center, and redox mediator, making the processes efficient and precluding side reactions. Inspired by this, a heterogeneous photocatalytic PCET system was established to achieve higher PCET driving forces by modifying proton relays into anthraquinone&#8208;based anionic coordination polymers. The proximally separated proton relays and photoredox&#8208;mediating anthraquinone moiety allowed pre&#8208;assembly of inert substrate between them, merging proton and electron into unsaturated bonds by photoreductive PCET, which enhanced reaction kinetics compared with the counter catalyst without proton relay. This photocatalytic PCET method was applied to a broad&#8208;scoped reduction of aryl ketones, unsaturated carbonyls, and aromatic compounds. The distinctive regioselectivities for the reduction of isoquinoline derivatives were found to occur on the carbon&#8208;ring sides. PCET&#8208;generated radical intermediate of quinoline could be trapped by alkene for proton relay&#8208;assisted Minisci addition, forming the pharmaceutical aza&#8208;acenaphthene scaffold within one step. When using heteroatom(X)&#8722;H/C&#8722;H compounds as proton&#8208;electron donors, this protocol could activate these inert bonds through photooxidative PCET to afford radicals and trap them by electron&#8208;deficient unsaturated compounds, furnishing the direct X&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Prenylated Macrocyclic Peptide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo discovery platform for artificial prenylated macrocycles against a target protein of choice has been developed, based on in vitro selection of a library of prenylated peptides expressed by the one&#8208;pot in vitro biosynthesis system named FIT&#8208;KgpF system. The obtained pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides showed potent inhibitory activity, improved stability, and cellular internalization, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation.







Abstract
Prenylation of peptides is widely observed in the secondary metabolites of diverse organisms, granting peptides unique chemical properties distinct from proteinogenic amino acids. Discovery of prenylated peptide agents has largely relied on isolation or genome mining of naturally occurring molecules. To devise a platform technology for de novo discovery of artificial prenylated peptides targeting a protein of choice, here we have integrated the thioether&#8208;macrocyclic peptide (teMP) library construction/selection technology, so&#8208;called RaPID (Random nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery) system, with a Trp&#8208;C3&#8208;prenyltransferase KgpF involved in the biosynthesis of a prenylated natural product. This unique enzyme exhibited remarkably broad substrate tolerance, capable of modifying various Trp&#8208;containing teMPs to install a prenylated residue with tricyclic constrained structure. We constructed a vast library of prenylated teMPs and subjected it to in vitro selection against a phosphoglycerate mutase. This selection platform has led to the identification of a pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated teMP inhibiting the target enzyme with an IC50 of 30&#8197;nM. Importantly, the prenylation was essential for the inhibitory activity, enhanced serum stability, and cellular uptake of the peptide, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation. This work showcases the de novo discovery platform for pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides, which is readily applicable to other drug targets.

Pd on ceria, an important catalytic system for various oxidation reactions, is studied for CO oxidation in a Research Article (e202408511) by Jan&#8208;Dierk Grunwaldt et&#8197;al. The image depicts the new concept of bringing the noble metal in contact with a strongly interacting nano&#8208;island (i.e. ceria) on alumina to 1) facilitate the formation of the active clusters, 2) hinder their redispersion into single atoms, while 3) preventing strong sintering of Pd due to the spatial separation of the CeO2 islands.

         <title>Microtiter Plate Immobilization Screening for Prototyping Heterogeneous Enzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microliter plate screening method has been developed to determine the consensus immobilization protocol for the heterogenization of multi&#8208;enzymatic reaction cascades. The optimal immobilization strategy leading to the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts was determined through an activity and stability assay, as demonstrated for an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid.







Abstract
Immobilization is a key enabling technology in applied biocatalysis that facilitates the separation, recovery, and reuse of heterogeneous biocatalysts. However, finding a consensus immobilization protocol for several enzymes forming a multi&#8208;enzyme system is extremely difficult and relies on a combinatorial trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, we describe a protocol in which 17 different carriers functionalized with different reactive groups are tested in a 96&#8208;well microtiter plate to screen up to 21 immobilization protocols for up to 18 enzymes. This screening includes an activity and stability assay to select the optimal immobilization chemistry to achieve the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts. The information retrieved from the screening can be rationalized using a Python&#8208;based application CapiPy. Finally, through scoring the screening results, we find the consensus immobilization protocol to assemble an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid. This methodology opens a path to speed up the prototyping of immobilized multi&#8208;enzyme pathways for chemical manufacturing.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel upcycling process transforms waste PET plastics, including colored, colorless, and even fabric&#8208;containing pieces, into valuable lactic acid. This sustainable and cost&#8208;effective method leverages a combination of Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling for efficient conversion and bipolar membrane electrodialysis separation for product purification. This approach offers a promising pathway for plastic waste valorization and sustainable lactic acid production, as demonstrated by Young&#8197;Kyu Hwang, Hye&#8208;Young Jang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410003).

         <title>Unveiling Highly Sensitive Active Site in Atomically Dispersed Gold Catalysts for Enhanced Ethanol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au&#8208;oxygen vacancy&#8208;Zr3+ complex sites proved to be efficient and selective catalytic sites for ethanol dehydrogenation by facilitating ethanol dissociation/adsorption, ethoxy activation, and product desorption.







Abstract
Developing a desirable ethanol dehydrogenation process necessitates a highly efficient and selective catalyst with low cost. Herein, we show that the &#8220;complex active site&#8221; consisting of atomically dispersed Au atoms with the neighboring oxygen vacancies (Vo) and undercoordinated cation on oxide supports can be prepared and display unique catalytic properties for ethanol dehydrogenation. The &#8220;complex active site&#8221; Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Zr3+ on Au1/ZrO2 exhibits the highest H2 production rate, with above 37,964&#8197;mol H2 per mol Au per hour (385&#8197;g&#8201;H2&#8201;

&#8201;h&#8722;1) at 350&#8201;&#176;C, which is 3.32, 2.94 and 15.0&#8197;times higher than Au1/CeO2, Au1/TiO2, and Au1/Al2O3, respectively. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate the structural sensitivity of these complex sites by assessing their selectivity and activity in ethanol dehydrogenation. Our study sheds new light on the design and development of cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient catalysts for ethanol dehydrogenation. Fundamentally, atomic&#8208;level catalyst design by colocalizing catalytically active metal atoms forming a structure&#8208;sensitive &#8220;complex site&#8221;, is a crucial way to advance from heterogeneous catalysis to molecular catalysis. Our study advanced the understanding of the structure sensitivity of the active site in atomically dispersed catalysts.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast&#8208;Healing Glassy Hyperbranched Plastics Capable of Restoring 26.4&#8197;MPa Tensile Strength within One Minute at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) consists of hyperbranched acyclic heterochains and multiple hydrogen bond arrays is demonstrated. It exhibits high modulus up to 2.5&#8197;GPa, but can restore 26.4&#8197;MPa of tensile strength within 1&#8197;min at room temperature. This ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing is attribute to the high mobility of branched terminal moieties and &#8220;water bridge&#8221; effect.







Abstract
The growing concern regarding widespread plastic pollution has propelled the development of sustainable self&#8208;healing plastics. Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to fabricating self&#8208;healing plastics, achieving rapid healing at room temperature is extremely challenging. Herein, we have developed an ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) by designing a hyperbranched molecular structure with a high density of multiple hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) on compliant acyclic heterochains and introducing trace water to form water bridge across the fractured surfaces. The compliant acyclic heterochains allow the dense multiple hydrogen bonds to form a frozen network, enabling tensile strength of up to 70&#8197;MPa and storage modulus of 2.5&#8197;GPa. The hyperbranched structure can drive the reorganization of the H&#8208;bonding network through the high mobility of the branched chains and terminals, thereby leading to self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Intriguingly, the presence of trace water vapor facilitates the formation of activated layers and the rearrangement of networks across the fractured UGPU sections, thereby enabling ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;healing at room temperature. Consequently, the restored tensile strength after healing for 1 minute achieves a historic&#8208;record of 26.4&#8197;MPa. Furthermore, the high transparency (&gt;90&#8201;%) and ultra&#8208;fast healing property of UGPU make it an excellent candidate for advanced optical and structural materials.

         <title>Broad Protection against Invasive Fungal Disease from a Nanobody Targeting the Active Site of Fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;Glucanosyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanobodies show promise in treating invasive fungal diseases such as aspergillosis and cryptococcosis. By selectively targeting enzymes critical for fungal cell wall remodeling, these single&#8208;domain antibodies significantly enhanced survival rates in animal models. This approach opens up a promising new pathway for the development of antifungal therapies, potentially improving outcomes for immunocompromised patients.







Abstract
Invasive fungal disease accounts for about 3.8&#8197;million deaths annually, an unacceptable rate that urgently prompts the discovery of new knowledge&#8208;driven treatments. We report the use of camelid single&#8208;domain nanobodies (Nbs) against fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucanosyltransferases (Gel) involved in &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan transglycosylation. Crystal structures of two Nbs with Gel4 from Aspergillus fumigatus revealed binding to a dissimilar CBM43 domain and a highly conserved catalytic domain across fungal species, respectively. Anti&#8208;Gel4 active site Nb3 showed significant antifungal efficacy in vitro and in vivo prophylactically and therapeutically against different A. fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, reducing the fungal burden and disease severity, thus significantly improving immunocompromised animal survival. Notably, C. deneoformans (serotype&#8197;D) strains were more susceptible to Nb3 and genetic Gel deletion than C. neoformans (serotype A) strains, indicating a key role for &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan remodelling in C. deneoformans survival. These findings add new insight about the role of &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan in fungal biology and demonstrate the potential of nanobodies in targeting fungal enzymes to combat invasive fungal diseases.

         <title>Introducing a &#960;&#8208;Skeleton Perpendicular to the Central Methylene Carbon in Alkanediamides: Design of Supramolecular Polymers with an Offset &#960;&#8208;Stacking Arrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers with an offset &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement were formed by introducing a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton perpendicularly onto the central methylene carbon atom of heptanediamide derivatives. The introduction of chiral alkyl chains at both termini of the heptanediamide further enables supramolecular polymerization of a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton with offset &#960;&#8208;stacking and effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly behavior of a heptanediamide derivative that contains a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton on its central methylene carbon atom has been examined. This molecule, which also contains two octyl chains, gelated the nonpolar solvent methylcyclohexane through the formation of fibrous nanostructures with hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation process. The supramolecular polymerization is accompanied by bathochromic shifts of both the absorption and fluorescence bands while maintaining a fluorescence quantum yield comparable to that of the monomeric state. Theoretical calculations provided an energetically stable structure, in which the &#960;&#8208;skeletons are stacked with an offset of more than 8.0&#8197;&#197;, replicating the experimentally observed absorption change due to exciton coupling. Moreover, a slow transition with an inversion of the chiral arrangement of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moieties was induced by replacing the octyl chains with chiral alkyl chains. Our molecular&#8208;design strategy was further applied to a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which also forms an offset &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangement and exhibits more effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.

         <title>Superionic Conduction in K3SbS4 Enabled by Cl&#8208;Modified Anion Lattice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cl&#8208;modified anion lattice in K3SbS4 enhances K+ transport. The anion&#8208;diversified K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm at room temperature, with a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This achievement represents the highest reported conductivity among non&#8208;oxide&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion conductors to date.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries emerge as promising alternatives to lithium batteries, leveraging their high natural abundance and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Developing potassium solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity is critical for realizing efficient potassium batteries. In this study, we present the synthesis of K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47, showcasing a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm and a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This represents an increase of over two orders of magnitude compared to the parent compound K3SbS4, marking the highest reported ionic conductivity for non&#8208;oxide potassium SEs. Solid&#8208;state 39K magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance on K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 reveals an increased population of mobile K+ ions with fast dynamics. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations further confirm a delocalized K+ density and significantly enhanced K+ diffusion. This work demonstrates diversification of the anion sublattice as an effective approach to enhance ion transport and highlights K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 as a promising SE for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (XOFs) Based on N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N Bonds: Robust Organic Networks Constructed by Fragile Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks have been constructed based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The frameworks XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities and maintained their stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents as well as in aqueous environments across a wide pH range (3&#8211;12).







Abstract
Organic frameworks face a trade&#8208;off between the framework stability and the bond dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that can generate stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. Although iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. In this work, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf, based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The formation of XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf was monitored by 1H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR&#8208;TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br) displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. They exhibited stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8211;12), while the corresponding model compounds BrPy2BF4/OTf decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF4 with OTf, which improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as an efficient oxidizing reagent in aqueous environments, in contrast with the sensitivity of BrPy2BF4/OTf, which performed well only in organic media. This study not only deepens our fundamental understanding of organic frameworks but also opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.

         <title>Quantitative Kinetic Insights from Operando&#8208;UV/Vis Spectroscopy: An Application to NH3&#8722;SCR of NOx on Cu&#8208;CHA Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV/Vis spectroscopy is coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic data, simultaneously monitoring both the catalyst redox state and the gas&#8208;phase dynamics during the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx with NH3 over Cu&#8208;CHA. This work highlights the accessibility of kinetic studies directly from operando UV/Vis spectroscopy paving the way for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relation under kinetically relevant conditions.







Abstract
We employ UV/Vis Diffuse Reflectance spectroscopy directly coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic information. We use as a show&#8208;case the CuII/CuI redox dynamics during the reduction half cycle of the NH3&#8208;Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) on Cu&#8208;CHA catalysts. Our measurements enable quantification of the fraction of oxidized Cu, reconstructed by Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) together with monitoring of the gas&#8208;phase evolution during the reaction. These data both on the dynamics of the gas&#8208;phase and of the active site oxidation state have been used to assess the reduction half cycle rate equation and estimate the rate constant. Our results in terms of reaction orders and kinetic constant are in line with previous findings in the literature. Overall, our results demonstrate that the combined analysis of the UV spectra and of the gas&#8208;phase dynamics provides converging and unparalleled kinetic insight: this approach effectively resolves ambiguities concerning RHC kinetics and mechanism. More in general, this work provides evidence that operando spectroscopy can be used to extract quantitative kinetic information on catalytic cycles.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation on Perovskite Quantum Dots Based on Ce&#8208;Oxygen Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ce ion doping increases the density of the lowest exciton state (X1 in CBM) of perovskite quantum dots, and Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity induces the formation of midgap states (MSs) involving oxygen. Under light excitation, the relaxation process of excitons to oxygen molecules is accelerated, resulting in the formation of a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus drives the generation of high value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have shown attractive prospects in the field of visible photocatalysis, especially in the synthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals. However, under aerobic conditions, the stable operation of QD catalysts has been limited by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoexcitation, especially superoxide species O2&#8901;&#8722;. Here, we propose a strategy of Ce3+ doping in perovskite QDs to guide superoxide species for photocatalytic oxidation reactions. In C(sp3)&#8722;H bond oxidation of hydrocarbons, superoxide species were rapidly generated and efficiently utilized on the surface of perovskite QDs, which achieves the stable operation of the catalytic system and obtains a high product conversion rate (15.3&#8197;mmol/g/h for benzaldehydes). The mechanism studies show that the strong Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity accelerates the relaxation process of photoinduced exciton transfer to superoxide species and inhibits the radiative recombination pathway. This work provides a new idea of utilizing oxygen species on perovskite surface and broadens the design strategy of high&#8208;performance QD photocatalysts.

         <title>Fence&#8208;type Molecular Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the slow redox kinetics of sulfur species and shuttling issues of soluble intermediates induced from the multiphase sulfur redox reactions are crucial factors for developing the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, we successfully constructed a novel molecular electrocatalyst through in situ polymerization of bis(3,4&#8208;dibromobenzene)&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (BD18C6) with polysulfide anions on the cathode interface. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer acts as a spatial "fence" to precisely control the unique redox characteristics of sulfur species, which could confine sulfur substance within its interior and interact with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to optimize the reaction barrier of sulfur species. The "fence"&#160;structure and the double&#8208;sided Li+ penetrability of the CE molecule may also prevent the CE catalytic sites from being covered by sulfur during cycling. This new fence&#8208;type electrocatalyst mitigates the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, enhances the redox activity of sulfur species, and promotes the formation of three&#8208;dimensional stacked lithium sulfide (Li2S) simultaneously. It thus enables lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to exhibit superior rate performance and cycle stability, which may also inspire development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy&#8208;efficient conversion process.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate&#8208;Mediated Electroenzymatic Synthesis via Biological Cofactor NADH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature&#8217;s machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. Utilising a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2&#160;reduction to formate with approximately 90% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150 mA cm&#8722;2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilised redox enzymes&#8212;alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)&#8212;to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8&#215;106 to 3.1&#215;106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled supramolecular DNA tetrahedra composed of programmed sequence&#8208;engineered complementary base&#8208;paired strands represent elusive nanostructures having key contributions to the development and diverse applications of DNA nanotechnology. By appropriate engineering of the strands, DNA tetrahedra of tuneable sizes and chemical functionalities were designed. Programmed functionalities for diverse applications were integrated into tetrahedra structures including sequence&#8208;specific recognition strands (aptamers), catalytic DNAzymes, nanoparticles, proteins, or fluorophore. The article presents a comprehensive review addressing methods to assemble and characterize the DNA tetrahedra nanostructures, and diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra framework are discussed. Topics being addressed include the application of structurally functionalized DNA tetrahedra nanostructure for the assembly of diverse optical or electrochemical sensing platforms and functionalized intracellular sensing and imaging modules. In addition, the triggered reconfiguration of DNA tetrahedra nanostructures and dynamic networks and circuits emulating biological transformations are introduced. Moreover, the functionalization of DNA tetrahedra frameworks with nanoparticles provides building units for the assembly of optical devices and for the programmed crystallization of nanoparticle superlattices. Finally, diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra in the field of nanomedicine are addressed. These include the DNA tetrahedra assisted permeation of nanocarriers into cells for imaging, controlled drug release, active chemodynamic/photodynamic treatment of target tissues, and regenerative medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Single Crystals of A Three&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Covalent Framework Containing Te&#8208;O&#8208;B&#8208;O Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>Extending covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into crystalline carbon&#8208;free covalent backbones is an important strategy to endow these materials with more exotic functions. Integrating metal&#8208;free inorganic and organic components into one covalent framework is an effective way to address the issue of poor thermal/solvent stability in the field of nonlinear optics (NLO). However, constructing such structures is very challenging. Here, we linked 3&#8208;connected nods (BO3) and 2&#8208;connected organic building blocks (Te(Ph)2) together to produce colorless single crystals (size up to 400 &#181;m) of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral covalent framework (CityU&#8208;22). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that CityU&#8208;22 has a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8208;O&#8208;B&#8208;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. The chiral CityU&#8208;22 displays good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat (the decomposition temperature above 300 &#176;C). Due to its non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone (&#8208;Te&#8208;O&#8208;B&#8208;O&#8208;), CityU&#8208;22 shows an ultraviolet NLO behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4 (KDP).</dc:description>

Due to its non-&#960;-conjugated backbone (-Te-O-B-O-), CityU-22 shows an ultraviolet NLO behavior with a second-harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4 (KDP).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;surface Synthesis of Triaza[5]triangulene through Cyclodehydrogenation and its Magnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triangulenes as neutral radicals are becoming promising candidates for future applications such as spintronics and quantum technologies. To extend the potential of the advanced materials, it is of importance to control their electronic and magnetic properties by multiple graphitic nitrogen doping. Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C&#8211;N bonds. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the &#960; orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low&#8208;energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via formal single electron reduction of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes under photochemical conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp3)&#8208;rich heterocycles are privileged building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Therefore, synthetic methods that provide access to novel saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles are in high demand. Herein, we report a general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) via a formal cycloaddition of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) with styrenes under photochemical conditions. To overcome the challenging direct single electron reduction of ABBs, we designed a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy that leverages a fast acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening of ABBs to form bromoazetidines, which undergo efficient debrominative radical formation to initiate the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction is applicable to a broad range of ABB&#8208;ketones and we demonstrate the 1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH products can be further functionalised to access larger saturated, conformationally rigid heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Logical Computing on a Transistor for Cancer Molecular Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the high degree of variability and complexity of cancer, precise monitoring and logical analysis of different nucleic acid markers are crucial for improving diagnostic precision and patient survival rates. However, existing molecular diagnostic methods normally suffer from high cost, cumbersome procedures, dependence on specialized equipment and the requirement of in&#8208;depth expertise in data analysis, failing to analyze multiple cancer&#8208;associated nucleic acid markers and provide immediate results in a point&#8208;of&#8208;care manner. Herein, we demonstrate a transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing (TDMC) platform that enables simultaneous detection and logical analysis of multiple microRNA (miRNA) markers on a single transistor. TDMC can perform not only basic logical operations such as "AND" and "OR", but also complex cascading computing, opening up new dimensions for multi&#8208;index logical analysis. Owing to the high efficiency, sensing and computations of multi&#8208;analytes can be operated on a transistor at a concentration as low as 2&#215;10&#8722;16 M, reaching the lowest concentration for DNA molecular computing. Thus, TDMC achieves an accuracy of 98.4% in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from 62 serum samples. As a convenient and accurate platform, TDMC holds promise for applications in &#8220;one&#8208;stop&#8221; personalized medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Active and Robust Ir&#8208;Mn Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Radical Coupling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41 &#197;) than the Mn&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49 &#197;). The modulated Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O (&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2&#160;via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3&#160;exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100 A gIr&#8208;1 at 1.5 V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63 V at 1.0 A cm&#8208;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15 &#956;V h&#8208;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;based Electrolytes with Controllable Hydrogen Bonding Networks for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and&#160;rational design of electrode/electrolyte interfaces remains challenging for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;oxygen battery is developed based on the Li&#8208;ion&#8208;conducted hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (LHOF) electrolyte and the core&#8208;shell HOF&#8208;DAT@CNT cathode with a few layers of HOF&#8208;DAT on surface of&#160;carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from the abundant dynamic hydrogen bonding network in&#160;LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, fast Li+ ion transport (2.2 &#215; 10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1), a high Li+ transfer number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05 V are achieved. Symmetric batteries constructed with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs exhibit a stably cycled duration of over 1400 h, which mainly stems from the jumping sites that promote a uniformly high rate of Li+ flux and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network structure that can relieve the structural changes during Li+ transport. LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs&#8208;based Li&#8211;O2 batteries exhibit high specific capacity (10335 mAh g&#8722;1), and stable cycling life up to 150 cycles. Moreover, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs endow good rate capability (128.8 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 C), long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (210 cycles). The design of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs opens an avenue for the development of novel SSEs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.</dc:description>

aminations of functionalized aryl fluorosulfates&#160;in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8211;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with&#160;&#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and&#160;t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.</dc:description>
