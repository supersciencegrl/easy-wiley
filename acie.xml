         <title>Leveraging Torsional&#8208;cum&#8208;Steric Strains: A Pre&#8208;macrocyclization Strategy Enables Conformation&#8208;Specific Fullerene Binding in m&#8208;Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though the chemistry of resorcinarenes is half a century old, the conformationally&#8208;locked resorcinarene crowns are generally constructed using hydrogen bonds or covalent tethers. Often, covalent tethering involves extra post&#8208;macrocyclization steps involving upper&#8208;rim functionalities. We have leveraged the torsional&#8208;cum&#8208;steric strains through &#945;&#8208;substituents of the lower&#8208;rim C&#8208;alkyl chains and accomplished conformationally&#8208;rigid fluorescent m&#8208;cyclophane deep&#8208;crowns in a predetermined way. The strategy offers a pre&#8208;macrocyclization route conserving upper&#8208;rim functionalities, an aspect overlooked in resorcinarene chemistry. X&#8208;ray structural and computational analyses unveil the cause for conformational rigidity in&#160;m&#8208;cyclophanes due to &#945;&#8208;branching in C&#8208;alkyls (linear vs. &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;branched).&#160; The conformationally&#8208;locked fluorescent deep&#8208;crown with a preorganized cavity captures hydrophobic spherical guest C60 in both solution and solid states specifically, when compared to conformationally&#8208;dynamic boats, enabling conformation&#8208;specific binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones with Two Non&#8208;vicinal Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral heterocyclics with two or more carbon stereocenters are quite important in many fields. However, powerful strategies for the construction of such synthetically valuable heterocyclics, especially with two or more remote carbon stereocenters, have largely lagged behind. We report here a powerful method for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters from readily available chemical feedstocks under mild conditions. Both of the two diastereoisomers can be obtained with good to excellent enantioselectivities. Because the well&#8208;designed copper/PyBox catalytic system overrides the intrinsic stereoinduction of the close chirality center generated by the previous innocent radical addition step. Nevertheless, this work has the power to selectively provide only a single diastereoisomer of them by taking advantage of the epimerization effect and to synthesize all the four diastereoisomers with the pair of chiral ligands L2 and L2'&#160;that have opposite chirality. The obtained useful chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones can be synthetically transformed into acyclic or cyclic molecules with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical reaction follows a linear relationship and even can be well performed with a less loading amount of ligand compared to that of the copper catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheets Stabilized by Hydrogen Bond Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimics of protein secondary and tertiary structure offer rationally&#8208;designed inhibitors of biomolecular interactions. &#946;&#8208;Sheet mimics have a storied history in bioorganic chemistry and are typically designed with synthetic or natural turn segments. We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter&#8208;&#946;&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally&#8208;defined macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic &#946;&#8208;turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of protein &#946;&#8208;sheets. To access turn&#8208;less antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein &#946;&#8208;sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over&#8208;abundance of aromatic&#8211;aromatic, cation&#8208;&#960; and ionic interactions in &#946;&#8208;sheets. In correspondence with natural &#946;&#8208;sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust &#946;&#8208;sheet formation when a specific pairing is incorporated. In isolated &#946;&#8208;sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopies, along with high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystallography, support our design principles.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8210;Organic Framework Crystal&#8210;Glass Composite Membranes with Preferential Permeation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8210;organic framework (MOF) glass is an easy to process and self&#8208;supported amorphous material that is suitable for fabricating gas separation membranes. However, MOF glasses, such as ZIF&#8208;62 and ZIF&#8208;4 have low porosity, which makes it difficult to obtain membranes with high permeance. Here, a self&#8208;supported MOF crystal&#8210;glass composite (CGC) membrane was prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the membrane matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler. The conversion of ZIF&#8208;62 from crystal to glass and the simultaneous partial melting of ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated by the melt state of ZIF&#8208;62 make the CGC membrane monolithic, eliminating non&#8208;selective grain boundaries and improving selectivity. The thickness of CGC membrane can be adjusted to fabricate a membrane without the need of a support substrate. CGC membranes exhibit a C2H6 permeance of 41,569 gas permeation units (GPU) and a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 7.16. The CGC membrane has abundant pores from the glassy state of ZIF&#8208;62 and the crystalline ZIF&#8208;8, which enables high gas permeance. ZIF&#8208;8 has preferential adsorption for C2H6 and promotes C2H6 transport in the membrane, and thus the GCG membrane exhibits ultrahigh C2H6 permeance and good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclization of the bendable 2,7&#8208;dimethoxythianthrene with methylene linkages afforded a pair of homochiral macrocycles featuring a hex&#8208;nut&#8208;like geometry. Their structures were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their stable planar chirality facilitates efficient resolution of the pair of enantiomers which could be readily derivatized. Installing phenylethynyl groups on their rims leads to luminescent tubular macrocycles exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with a large dissymmetry value |glum| of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1&#8208;Azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By judicious development of acylimidazolinone as activating group and the use of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA) catalyst, the cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes with 2&#8208;naphthols was realized with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and stereoretentive conversions of products to other binaphthyl compounds were found viable.







Abstract
Atroposelective cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most appealing routes to construct axially chiral binaphthyl molecules due to the modular and succinct nature. Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings offer reliable synthetic means, alternative reaction modes that could be applied to broader substrate range without their pre&#8208;functionalization is highly desirable. Herein we show that the application of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst as organocatalyst could accomplish cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;naphthols with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity as well as excellent enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility. The identification of acylimidazolinone auxiliary for azo activating group, effective remote catalyst control and arene resonance effect synergistically play key roles in the development of this method. The utility is further demonstrated by transformations of the products into other binaphthyl compounds with perfectly retained axial chirality.

         <title>Simultaneous Ring Contraction and Expansion Reaction: Electrosynthesis of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Fulleroids and Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemically triggered simultaneous ring contraction and expansion reaction of fullerotetrahydropyridazines with electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen affords pyrazoline&#8208;fused fulleroids with unprecedented 1,1,2,6&#8208; or 1,1,4,6&#8208;addition patterns.







Abstract
Simultaneous electrochemical ring contraction and expansion reactions remain unexplored to date. Herein, the reductive electrosynthesis of heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids from fullerotetrahydropyridazines and electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen has been achieved with concurrent ring contraction and ring expansion. When trifluoroacetic acid and alkyl bromides are employed as electrophiles, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,2,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively formed. In contrast, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,4,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively produced as two separable stereoisomers if phthaloyl chloride is used as the electrophile. The reaction proceeds through multiple steps of electroreduction, heterocycle ring&#8208;opening, oxygen oxidation, heterocycle contraction, fullerene cage expansion, and nucleophilic addition. The structures of these fulleroids have been determined by spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The observed high regioselectivities have been rationalized by theoretical calculations. Representative fulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells as the third component and exhibit good performance.

         <title>A Quencher&#8208;Based Blood&#8208;Autofluorescence&#8208;Suppression Strategy Enables the Quantification of Trace Analytes in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a strategy for the suppression of blood autofluorescence to develop an activatable fluorescent probe for reliable quantification of trace analytes in whole blood. As a result of the efficient quenching the blood autofluorescence, this probe achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilutions of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood.







Abstract
Precise quantification of trace components in whole blood via fluorescence is of great significance. However, the applicability of current fluorescent probes in whole blood is largely hindered by the strong blood autofluorescence. Here, we proposed a blood autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy to develop an activable fluorescent probe for quantification of trace analyte in whole blood. Based on inner filter effect, by screening fluorophores whose absorption overlapped with the emission of blood, a redshift BODIPY quencher with an absorption wavelength ranging from 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm was selected for its superior quenching efficiency and high brightness. Two 7&#8208;nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5] oxadiazole ether groups were introduced onto the BODIPY skeleton for quenching its fluorescence and the response of H2S, a gas signal molecule that can hardly be quantified because of its low concentration in whole blood. Such detection system shows a pretty low background signal and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;back ratio, the probe thus achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilution of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood. Moreover, this autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy could be expanded to other trace analytes detection in whole blood, which may accelerate the application of fluorescent probes in clinical blood test.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;scan ultraselective heteronuclear polarization transfer (UHPT) NMR method is presented. When applied to chromopeptide pharmaceuticals and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide with highly complex NMR signals in both the 1H and 13C dimension, this method provided accurate 1H&#8208;13C correlation and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra of individual subunits, which enabled unambiguous structure assignment.







Abstract
Complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of organic compounds containing multiple analogous substructures or mixtures pose a significant challenge to structural identification, thus resulting in frequent misassignment of structures. The GEMSTONE method, a single&#8208;scan technique that selectively excites a specific proton signal among the crowded NMR signals, was recently proposed as a solution. However, its extension to the polarization transfer method for heteronuclear spin systems was unsuccessful. Herein, we present an extension method that addresses the altered heteronuclear polarization transfer efficiency and enables the acquisition of ultraselective 13C and 1H&#8208;13C correlation NMR subspectra with hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the structural analysis of a chromopeptide pharmaceutical and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide.

         <title>A Time&#8208;Resolved FRET Assay Identifies a Small Molecule that Inhibits the Essential Bacterial Cell Wall Polymerase FtsW</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsW is a newly discovered peptidoglycan polymerase essential for cell division. We developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay, which we used to screen a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a small molecule that inhibits FtsW in vitro. Using a fluorescently labeled, non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound displaces Lipid&#8197;II from FtsW.







Abstract
The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for bacterial survival. To form the cell wall, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs) polymerize Lipid&#8197;II to make glycan strands and then those strands are crosslinked by transpeptidases (TPs). Recently, the SEDS (for shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins were identified as a new class of PGTs. The SEDS protein FtsW, which produces septal peptidoglycan during cell division, is an attractive target for novel antibiotics because it is essential in virtually all bacteria. Here, we developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay to monitor PGT activity and screened a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a compound that inhibits S.&#8197;aureus FtsW in vitro. Using a non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound competes with Lipid&#8197;II for binding to FtsW. The assays described here will be useful for discovering and characterizing other PGT inhibitors.

&lt;p&gt;FtsW is a newly discovered peptidoglycan polymerase essential for cell division. We developed a time-resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay, which we used to screen a &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a small molecule that inhibits FtsW in vitro. Using a fluorescently labeled, non-polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound displaces Lipid&#8197;II from FtsW.

         <title>Access to Polysulfides through Photocatalyzed Dithiosulfonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a general photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane with dithiosulfonates. The resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is an excellent nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, which can react with a variety of electrophiles to access unsymmetric disulfides efficiently.







Abstract
In this study, we outline a general method for photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, a diene, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane using dithiosulfonate reagents (ArSO2&#8208;SSR) with improved atom economy. Both &#8220;ArSO2&#8208;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8208;SSR&#8221; on the dithiosulfonate are transferred under mild conditions with broad substrate scope, high stereoselectivity, and complete regioselectivity. Significantly, the resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is a general and practical nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, reacting with a variety of electrophiles efficiently. Both reactions can be conducted on gram scale, rendering the approach highly valuable.

         <title>Layered Zeolite for Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new layered zeolite (ECNU&#8208;28) with interlayer swollen structure is prepared hydrothermally using decamethonium bromide as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Its phase exfoliation is realized under mild conditions, giving high&#8208;quality suspensions containing flat and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. The resulting 2D zeolite membrane prepared by vacuum filtration gives high&#8208;performance sieving of H2 from CO2 or CH4.







Abstract
Membrane separation is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular sieving membranes featuring unique nanopores and low transport resistance have the potential to achieve highly permeable and selective mixture separation with low energy consumption. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio zeolite nanosheets with intrinsic molecular&#8208;sieving pores perpendicular to the layers are desirable building blocks for fabricating high&#8208;performance 2D zeolite membrane. However, a wider application of 2D zeolitic membranes is restricted by the limited number of recognized zeolite nanosheets. Herein, we report a swollen layered zeolite, ECNU&#8208;28, with SZR topology and eight&#8208;member ring (8&#8208;MR, 3.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;4.8&#8197;&#197;) pores normal to the nanosheets. It can be easily exfoliated to construct 2D membrane, which shows a high hydrogen selectivity up to 130 from natural gas and is promising for hydrogen purification and greenhouse gas capture.

         <title>Formal Insertion of Alkenes Into C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds Mediated by Fluorine&#8208;Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent a powerful approach to prepare complex fluorinated compounds, yet they are extremely scarce. Here we report a hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated system that allows for activation of activated alkyl fluorides without sequestering the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. This allows for formal insertion of fluorinated styrenes into the C&#8722;F bond affording gem&#8208;difluorinated products.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent an attractive approach to prepare valuable fluorinated compounds. The high strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the low reactivity of the fluoride released upon C&#8722;F bond cleavage, however, mean that examples of such processes are extremely scarce in the literature. Here we report a reaction system that overcomes these challenges using hydrogen bond donors that both activate C&#8722;F bonds and allow for downstream reactions with fluoride. In the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol, benzyl and propargyl fluorides undergo efficient formal C&#8722;F bond insertion across &#945;&#8208;fluorinated styrenes. This process, which does not require any additional fluorinating reagent, occurs under mild conditions and delivers products featuring the gem&#8208;difluoro motif, which is attracting increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, readily available organic bromides can be engaged directly in a one&#8208;pot process that avoids the isolation of organic fluorides.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole alkaloids are of great interest to organic and medicinal chemists and material scientists. This unique direct C&#8722;H functionalization has enabled efficient derivatization of commercially available carbazoles in a highly site&#8208;selective manner via a unique six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate. This reaction boasts good functional group compatibility and displays distinct reactivities based on C3&#8208;substituents of unsymmetrical substrates.







Abstract
Carbazole alkaloids hold great potential in pharmaceutical and material sciences. However, the current approaches for C1 functionalization of carbazoles rely on the use of a pre&#8208;installed directing group, severely limiting their applicability and hindering their overall efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time the development of direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and acylation of carbazoles assisted by norbornene (NBE) as a transient directing mediator. Notably, the involvement of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate was suggested in this case, representing the first example of such intermediacy within the extensively studied Pd/norbornene reactions realm.

         <title>1D Choline&#8208;PbI3&#8208;Based Heterostructure Boosts Efficiency and Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ChPbI3 was obtained by ChI treatment of the CsPbI3 surface to construct a 1D/3D heterostructure, which significantly improves the defect&#8208;assisted recombination and stability of CsPbI3. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion/certified efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%/17.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Defects in perovskite are key factors in limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Generally, choline halide (ChX) can effectively passivate defects by binding with charged point defects of perovskite. However, we verified that ChI can react with CsPbI3 to form a novel crystal phase of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) ChPbI3, which constructs 1D/3D heterostructure with 3D CsPbI3, passivating the defects of CsPbI3 more effectively and then resulting in significantly improved photoluminescence lifetime from 20.2&#8197;ns to 49.4&#8197;ns. Moreover, the outstanding chemical inertness of 1D ChPbI3 and the repair of undesired &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 deficiency during its formation process can significantly enhance the stability of CsPbI3 film. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, CsPbI3 carbon&#8208;based PSCs (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 18.05&#8201;% and a new certified record of 17.8&#8201;% in hole transport material (HTM)&#8208;free inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;ChPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained by ChI treatment of the CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface to construct a 1D/3D heterostructure, which significantly improves the defect-assisted recombination and stability of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, the assembled carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) delivered a champion/certified efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%/17.8&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defects in perovskite are key factors in limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Generally, choline halide (ChX) can effectively passivate defects by binding with charged point defects of perovskite. However, we verified that ChI can react with CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form a novel crystal phase of one-dimensional (1D) ChPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which constructs 1D/3D heterostructure with 3D CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, passivating the defects of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; more effectively and then resulting in significantly improved photoluminescence lifetime from 20.2&#8197;ns to 49.4&#8197;ns. Moreover, the outstanding chemical inertness of 1D ChPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the repair of undesired &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency during its formation process can significantly enhance the stability of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 18.05&#8201;% and a new certified record of 17.8&#8201;% in hole transport material (HTM)-free inorganic C-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Thiazoline&#8208;Containing Peptides by Cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;Thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;Mercaptoethylamine Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
The spontaneous cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamines to thiazolines and its application to the efficient and epimerization&#8208;free synthesis of thiazoline&#8208;containing peptides is described. The novel method features mild reaction conditions and short reaction times while tolerating reactive functional groups, providing rapid access to complex thiazoline&#8208;containing peptides including the natural product mollamide&#8197;F.







Abstract
Herein we report a mild, efficient, and epimerization&#8208;free method for the synthesis of peptide&#8208;derived 2&#8208;thiazolines and 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazines based on a cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamine or N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropylamine derivatives. The described reaction can be easily carried out in aqueous solutions at room temperature and it is triggered by change of the pH, leading to complex thiazoline or dihydrothiazine derivatives without epimerization in excellent to quantitative yields. The new method was applied in the total synthesis of the marine metabolite mollamide&#8197;F, resulting in the revision of its stereochemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective borylcupration of borylated skipped (Z)&#8208;dienes generates diborylated alkylcopper species that are involved in an intramolecular stereospecific B/Cu 1,3&#8208;rearrangement by migration of Bpin moiety from C(sp2) to C(sp3). DFT mechanistic studies showed that boryl migration occurs through the formation of 4&#8208;membered boracycle intermediate with a moderate free&#8208;energy barrier. Moreover, the use of KOMe forms stable Lewis base adducts with Bpin moieties that blocks the reaction. Subsequently to the 1,3&#8208;boron shift, the in situ electrophilic trapping allows selective C&#8208;H, C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X bonds, followed by intramolecular cross coupling giving access to cyclic functionalized alkylidenecyclohexanes or alkylidenecyclobutanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Formal (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with Ketenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design, synthesis and application of benzene bioisosteres have attracted a lot of attention in the past 20 years. Recently, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have emerged as highly attractive bioisosteres for ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted benzenes. Herein we report a mild, scalable and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones through Lewis acid catalysed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane ketones with disubstituted ketenes. The reaction shows high functional group tolerance as documented by the successful preparation of various 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl as well as 3,3&#8208;bisalkyl bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones (26 examples, up to 89% yield). Postfunctionalization of the exocyclic ketone moiety is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding MOF Flexibility: An Analysis Focused on Pillared Layer MOFs as a Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks respond to molecular or physical stimuli with spontaneous pore opening or closing, leading to applications in gas separation, storage, sensing, actuation etc. The review provides insights into decisive factors affecting switchability gained from combined simulations, in situ characterization methods and the dedicated design of pillared&#8208;layer MOF model materials varying in composition, structure, size, morphology, and disorder.







Abstract
Flexible porous frameworks are at the forefront of materials research. A unique feature is their ability to open and close their pores in an adaptive manner induced by chemical and physical stimuli. Such enzyme&#8208;like selective recognition offers a wide range of functions ranging from gas storage and separation to sensing, actuation, mechanical energy storage and catalysis. However, the factors affecting switchability are poorly understood. In particular, the role of building blocks, as well as secondary factors (crystal size, defects, cooperativity) and the role of host&#8211;guest interactions, profit from systematic investigations of an idealized model by advanced analytical techniques and simulations. The review describes an integrated approach targeting the deliberate design of pillared layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks as idealized model materials for the analysis of critical factors affecting framework dynamics and summarizes the resulting progress in their understanding and application.

         <title>Smart Materials Based on Synthetic Host Molecules: The Role of Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry in the Fabrication and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials that can respond to stimuli have the potential to revolutionize many fields such as the chemical and medical industries. This Minireview summarizes the recent development in smart materials based on synthetic host molecules (SHMs) and their associated host&#8211;guest chemistry. The role of the host&#8211;guest recognition in the material's fabrication and application is highlighted. Understanding the responsiveness of smart materials at the molecular level should empower researchers to design and prepare extremely intelligent systems that can complement the rising demands on automation and robotics.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive or smart materials have recently shown a significant impact on the frontier of material science and engineering. The exponential development of synthetic host molecules (SHMs) over the last decades and their corresponding host&#8211;guest chemistry, have empowered researchers with new opportunities to design and construct tailored or guest&#8208;specific smart materials. In this Minireview, we present the recent advancements in synthetic host based smart materials, ranging from the fabrication strategies to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications including adsorption, separation, luminescence, self&#8208;healing and actuation. The role that the host&#8211;guest chemistry plays in these systems is highlighted throughout to give a better prospective of the available possibilities for emerging materials of future economies.

         <title>Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;Enabled Cell&#8208;Surface Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling toward More Efficient Capture of Physically Interacting Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercellular proximity labeling has emerged as a promising approach to enable the study of cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs), but the efficiency of current platforms is limited. Here, we use Ru(bpy)32+ to construct an efficient photocatalytic proximity labeling (PPL) system on the cell surface that allows the highly discriminative CCI detection with spatiotemporal resolution. Through the mechanism study and quantitative characterization on living cells, we demonstrate that the singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mechanism is more efficient and specific than the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism in Ru&#8208;mediated PPL. Three Ru(bpy)32+ catalysts with different cell&#8208;anchoring moieties are prepared to facilitate the catalyst loading on different primary cells. Finally, based on this Ru&#8208;1O2&#8208;hydrazide system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR&#8208;T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis Strategies towards Tagged Homogeneous Catalysts to Improve Their Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recycling of homogeneous catalysts while keeping them in the homogeneous matrix is an ongoing challenge many reactions face if they are to take the step into industrial application. While a plethora of different synthetic approaches towards better, recyclable homogeneous catalysts exist, the literature shows a gap when one searches for a concise overview of the different catalyst modifications. This review is designed to close that gap by summarising the existing synthesis pathways towards polar, non&#8208;polar, fluorous, and molecular&#8208;weight&#8208;enlarged catalysts and examining their respective synthesis routes with a focus on modular and late&#8208;stage approaches. Furthermore, we map out the potential for a generally applicable tag library that allows straightforward catalyst modifications to tune them for each desired recycling strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Electrodes With Sensing Membranes Covalently Attached to Both the Inert Polymer Substrate and Conductive Carbon Contact</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) is of interest to many clinical, environmental, and industrial applications. However, upon extended exposure to samples and under thermal and mechanical stress, adhesion between these membranes and underlying substrates often weakens gradually. Eventually, this results in the formation of a water layer at the interface to the underlying electron conductor and in delamination of the membrane from the electrode body, both major limitations to long&#8208;term monitoring. To prevent these problems without increasing the complexity of design with a mechanical attachment, we use photo&#8208;induced graft polymerization to simultaneously attach ionophore&#8208;doped crosslinked poly(decyl methacrylate) sensing membranes covalently both to a high surface area carbon as ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transducer and to inert polymeric electrode body materials (i.e., polypropylene and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene)). The sensors provide high reproducibility (standard deviation of E0 of 0.2 mV), long&#8208;term stability (potential drift 7 &#181;V/h over 260 h), and resistance to sterilization in an autoclave (121 &#176;C, 2.0 atm for 30 min). For this work, a covalently attached H+ selective ionophore was used to prepare pH sensors with advantages over conventional pH glass electrodes, but similar use of other ionophores makes this approach suitable to the fabrication of ISEs for a variety of analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Water and Deep Eutectic Solvents in Organosodium Chemistry: Chemoselective Nucleophilic Functionalizations in Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing the development of perfecting the use of polar organometallics in bio&#8208;inspired solvents, we report on the effective generation in batch of organosodium compounds, by the oxidative addition of a C&#8211;Cl bond to sodium, a halogen/sodium exchange, or by direct sodiation, when using sodium bricks or neopentylsodium in hexane as sodium sources. C(sp3)&#8208;, C(sp2)&#8208;, and C(sp)&#8208;hybridized alkyl and (hetero)aryl sodiated species have been chemoselectively trapped (in competition with protonolysis), with a variety of electrophiles when working &#8220;on water&#8221;, or in biodegradable choline chloride/urea or L&#8208;proline/glycerol eutectic mixtures, under hydrous conditions and at room temperature. Additional benefits include a very short reaction time (20 s), a wide substrate scope, and good to excellent yields (up to 98%) of the desired adducts. The practicality of the proposed protocol was demonstrated by setting up a sodium&#8208;mediated multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the anticholinergic drug orphenadrine.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Rh on High&#8208;Index CeO2 Facet for Highly Enhanced Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducible oxide&#8208;supported noble metal nanoparticles exhibit high activity in catalyzing many important oxidation reactions. However, atom migration under harsh reaction conditions leads to deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, single&#8208;atom catalysts demonstrate enhanced stability, but often suffer from poor catalytic activity owing to the ionized surface state. In this work, we address the poor activity and stability issues simultaneously by synthesizing highly active and durable rhodium (Rh) single&#8208;atom catalysts through a &#8220;wrap&#8208;bake&#8208;peel&#8221; process. The pre&#8208;coated SiO2 layer during synthesis of catalyst plays a crucial role in not only protecting CeO2 support against sintering, but also donating electron to weaken the Ce&#8208;O bond, producing highly loaded Rh single atoms on the CeO2 support exposed with high&#8208;index&#160;{420}. Benefiting from the unique electronic structure of CeO2&#160;facets, more oxygen vacancies are generated along with the deposition of more electropositive Rh single atoms, leading to remarkably improved catalytic performance in CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Volatile Dual&#8208;Solvent Assisted Intermediate Phase Regulation for Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedented development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) makes them one of the most promising candidates for terawatt&#8208;scale green energy production with low cost. However, the high boiling point solvents during the solution&#8208;processed film deposition cause anisotropic crystal growth and toxic solvent vapor during high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. Here, a dual&#8208;component green solvent consisting of isopropyl acetate and acetonitrile is proposed to form a volatile perovskite precursor, which can realize the high&#8208;quality perovskite thin film deposition by intermediate phase regulation. A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate phase is constructed with the engagement of isopropyl acetate as co&#8208;solvent, which suppresses the exploding nucleation rate in volatile perovskite precursor, providing a fine grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition. The corresponding PSCs fabricated by blade coating without anti&#8208;solvents or gas quenching achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.37% and 15.29% for the areas of 14.08 cm2 and 37.83 cm2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Conjugated Dienes with Tertiary Silanes Controlled by Hemilabile Hybrid P,O Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, were synthesized and utilized in Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation involving tertiary silanes, unactivated alkenes, and conjugated dienes. The ligand displayed a remarkable level of reactivity for alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes and its use resulted in a significant improvement in the regioselectivity of diene hydrosilylation towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the bidentate nature of the ligand, with coordination of phosphorus and oxygen. Control experiments provided evidence for the formation of Pd(0) species and the reversibility of Pd&#8208;H insertion in the reaction mechanism.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) computations supported the importance of the hemilabile P,O ligand in stabilizing both the rate&#8208;determining transition state of Pd&#8208;H insertion and the transition state of reductive elimination that determines the regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Tetra&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Enamido Phosphorus Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of&#160;enamido phosphorus derivatives is one of the most efficient methods for the construction of chiral amino phosphorus products, among which the congested tetra&#8208;substituted substrates remains an unaddressed challenge. In this study, we utilize a commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos system for the efficient and stereoselective hydrogenation of a wide set of tetra&#8208;substituted cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphonates/phosphine oxides, thus enabling access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphorus compounds featuring two vicinal stereocenters. This protocol was broadly applicable to different ring systems possessing various phosphonate/phosphine oxide&#160;groups and further applied in the preparation of amino&#8208;phosphine ligands. DFT mechanistic explorations indicate that the C=C migratory insertion into Rh(III)&#8208;H bond could be the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step. The origins of stereoselectivity are revealed through distortion/interaction analysis, which is primarily regulated by distinguished dispersion interactions and steric repulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Effect of Chiral Small Molecules in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Vaccine&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although numerous chiral small molecules have been discovered and synthesized, the investigation on their enantioselective immunological effects remains limited. In this study, we designed and synthesized a pair of small molecule enantiomers (R/S&#8208;ResP) by covalently bonding two immunostimulators (resiquimod/Res) onto a planar chiral framework (paracyclophane/P). Notably, we found that S&#8208;ResP exhibits a 4.05&#8208;fold higher affinity for toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) than R&#8208;ResP, thereby more effectively enhancing the functions of dendritic cells and macrophages in cytokine secretion and antigen internalization. Furthermore, we observed that S&#8208;ResP significantly enhances RBD antigen&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains compared to R&#8208;ResP. These findings demonstrate the enantioselective effects of small molecules on regulating vaccine&#8208;induced immune responses and emphasize the significance of chirality in designing small molecular adjuvants.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Strapped Zwitterionic NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes for Bioconjugation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye ZW800&#8208;1 have been tested in humans. However, long&#8208;term imaging protocols using ZW800&#8208;1 conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of ZW800&#8208;1, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface. The fluorescent antibody conjugates show excellent tumor&#8208;targeting specificity in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The enhanced stability provided by doubly strapped molecular design will enable new classes of in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging experiments with possible translation to humans.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx Cocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting by Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ photo&#8208;deposition of both Pt and CoOx cocatalysts on the facets of poly triazine imide (PTI) crystals has been developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. However, undesired backward reaction (i.e., water formation) on the noble Pt surface is a spontaneously down&#8208;hill process, which restricts their efficiency to run overall water splitting reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that the efficiency for photocatalytic overall water splitting could be largely promoted by the decoration of Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively. Results reveal that the dual cocatalysts greatly extract charges from bulk to surface, while Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst dramatically restrains the backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 20.2% for photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only NIR&#8208;dye approved for clinical use. Despite its versatility in photonic applications and potential for photothermal therapy, its photobleaching hinders its application. Here we discovered a nanostructure of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG) generated by using ICG to stabilize nanoemulsion, after which ICG enabled complete dimerization on the nanoemulsion shell, followed by J&#8208;aggregation of ICG&#8208;dimer, resulting in a narrow, red&#8208;shifted (780nm &#8594; 894nm) and intense (~2&#8208;fold) absorbance. Compared to ICG, Nano&#8208;dICG demonstrated superior photothermal conversion (2&#8208;fold higher), significantly reduced photodegradation (&#8208;9.6% vs. &#8208;46.3%), and undiminished photothermal effect (7 vs. 2 cycles) under repeated irradiations, in addition to excellent colloidal and structural stabilities. Following intravenous injection, Nano&#8208;dICG enabled real&#8208;time tracking of its delivery to mouse tumor within 24h by photoacoustic imaging at a NIR wavelength (890nm) distinct from the endogenous signal to guide effective photothermal therapy. The unprecedented finding of nanostructure&#8208;driven ICG dimerization leads to ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Monomer Design Synergizing Property Trade&#8208;offs in Developing Polymers for Circularity and Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid monomer design can unify desired but conflicting properties in a single monomer that in turn leads to intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties that can be radically different than those of the parent homopolymers or copolymers.







Abstract
Current search for more sustainable plastics seeks to redesign polymers possessing both chemical recyclability to monomer for a circular plastics economy and desirable performance that can rival or even exceed today's non&#8208;recyclable or hard&#8208;to&#8208;recycle petroleum&#8208;based incumbents. However, within a traditional monomer framework it is challenging to optimize, concurrently, contrasting polymerizability/depolymerizability and recyclability/performance properties. Here, we highlight the emerging hybrid monomer design strategy to develop intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties, aiming to unify desired, but otherwise conflicting, properties in a single monomer. Conceptually, this design hybridizes parent monomer pairs of contrasting, mismatching, or matching properties into offspring monomers that not only unify the above&#8208;described conflicting properties but also radically alter the resultant polymer properties far beyond the limits of what either parent homopolymers or their copolymers can achieve.

         <title>Chasing the Elusive &#8220;In&#8208;Between&#8221; State of the Copper&#8208;Amyloid &#946; Complex by X&#8208;ray Absorption through Partial Thermal Relaxation after Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction and thermal relaxation unravels the structure of an intermediate of the CuII/CuI A&#946;1&#8211;16 redox cycling. The X&#8208;ray beam promotes CuII reduction to CuI at 10&#8197;K, then the sample undergoes partial structural relaxation at 200&#8197;K and a spectrum measured at 10&#8197;K is compatible with a possible &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; structure featuring an imidazole ring and a bi&#8208;dentate Asp residue in the Cu coordination site.







Abstract
The redox activity of Cu ions bound to the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide is implicated as a source of oxidative stress in the context of Alzheimer's disease. In order to explain the efficient redox cycling between CuII&#8208;A&#946; (distorted square&#8208;pyramidal) and CuI&#8208;A&#946; (digonal) resting states, the existence of a low&#8208;populated &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; state, prone to bind Cu in both oxidation states, has been postulated. Here, we exploited the partial X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction at 10&#8197;K, followed by a thermal relaxation at 200&#8197;K, to trap and characterize by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) a partially reduced Cu&#8208;A&#946;1&#8211;16 species different from the resting states. Remarkably, the XAS spectrum is well&#8208;fitted by a previously proposed model of the &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; state, hence providing the first direct spectroscopic characterization of an intermediate state. The present approach could be used to explore and identify the catalytic intermediates of other relevant metal complexes.

         <title>Near IR Bandgap Semiconducting 2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Rhombic Lattice and High Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rhombic 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) single crystal (named Cu2(OHPTP)) is achieved based on a novel octahydroxyphenanthro[9,10:b]triphenylene ligand. Cu2(OHPTP) is an intrinsic p&#8208;type semiconductor with a band gap of 0.5&#8197;eV and charge carrier mobility as high as &#8776;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique class of electronic materials. However, 2D c&#8208;MOFs with band gaps in the Vis&#8208;NIR and high charge carrier mobility are rare. Most of the reported conducting 2D c&#8208;MOFs are metallic (i.e. gapless), which largely limits their use in logic devices. Herein, we design a phenanthrotriphenylene&#8208;based, D2h&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;extended ligand (OHPTP), and synthesize the first rhombic 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystals (Cu2(OHPTP)). The continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) analysis unveils the orthorhombic crystal structure at the atomic level with a unique slipped AA stacking. The Cu2(OHPTP) is a p&#8208;type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of &#8776;0.50&#8197;eV and exhibits high electrical conductivity of 0.10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and high charge carrier mobility of &#8776;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations underline the predominant role of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport in this semiquinone&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF.

         <title>Ionic Nickel Embedded in Ceria with High Specific CO2 Methanation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized and tested for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 showing high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations identified ionic Ni species embedded in ceria as the catalytically active centers. Installation of highly dispersed ionic Ni species in the oxide matrix achieved a heterogeneous catalyst with high performance.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methane is gaining increasing interest as one of the most promising ways to store intermittent renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. Ni particles supported on CeO2 represent a highly efficient, stable and inexpensive catalyst for this reaction. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were tested for CO2 methanation showing an extremely high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando characterization reveals that this performance is tightly associated with ionic &#925;i and Ce3+ surface sites, while formation of metallic Ni does not seem to considerably promote the reaction. Theoretical calculations confirmed the stability of interstitial ionic Ni sites on ceria surfaces and highlighted the role of Ce&#8208;O frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), Ni&#8208;O classical Lewis pair (CLP) and Ni&#8208;Ce pair sites to the activation of H2 and CO2 molecules. To a large extent, the theoretical predictions were validated by in situ spectroscopy under H2 and CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2 gaseous environments.

Theoretical calculations confirmed the stability of interstitial ionic Ni sites on ceria surfaces and highlighted the role of Ce-O frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), Ni-O classical Lewis pair (CLP) and Ni-Ce pair sites to the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. To a large extent, the theoretical predictions were validated by in situ spectroscopy under H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gaseous environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Multi&#8208;Cationic Molecular Chains for Gate Mechanism Controlled Superionic Conduction in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A COF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (MCMCs) was developed for gate&#8208;mechanism controlled ion transport, achieving a high Li+ conductivity of 4.91&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transference number of 0.71 simultaneously. The ultra&#8208;light COF&#8208;MCMC SSE enables a solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) with a high specific energy density of up to 403.4&#8197;Wh&#8722;1&#8201;kg&#8722;1 under a low N/P ratio and high cathode loading.







Abstract
Although solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are high potential in achieving better safety and higher energy density, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) cannot fully satisfy the complicated requirements of SSBs. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (COF&#8208;MCMC) was developed as an efficient SSE. The MCMCs chemically anchored on COF channels were generated by nano&#8208;confined copolymerization of cationic ionic liquid monomers, which can function as Li+ selective gates. The coulombic interaction between MCMCs and anions leads to easier dissociation of Li+ from coordinated states, and thus Li+ transport is accelerated. While the movement of anions is restrained due to the charge interaction, resulting in a high Li+ conductivity of 4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transference number of 0.71 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The SSBs with COF&#8208;MCMC demonstrate an excellent specific energy density of 403.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with high cathode loading and limited Li metal source.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Zinc Adeninate Framework (ZAF) for Immobilization of Catalytic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic dynamic framework, ZAF, can be readily constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of zinc adeninate macrocycles through H&#8208;bonding interactions. ZAF features high biocompatibility, structural flexibility, pH responsivity, and open base pairing sites, where it can load catalytic ssDNA with 96&#8201;% loading efficiency.







Abstract
Effective immobilization and delivery of genetic materials is at the forefront of biological and medical research directed toward tackling scientific challenges such as gene therapy and cancer treatment. Herein we present a biologically inspired hydrogen&#8208;bonded zinc adeninate framework (ZAF) consisting of zinc adeninate macrocycles that self&#8208;assemble into a 3D framework through adenine&#8208;adenine interactions. ZAF can efficiently immobilize DNAzyme with full protection against enzyme degradation and physiological conditions until it is successfully delivered into the nucleus. As compared to zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZAFs are twofold more biocompatible with a significant loading efficiency of 96&#8201;%. Overall, our design paves the way for expanding functional hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based systems as potential platforms for the loading and delivery of biologics.

         <title>Reactive Superhydrophobic Surfaces for Interlayer Electrical Connectivity in Three&#8208;dimensional Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous polymer film with amine reactivity and inherent superhydrophobicity (RSH film) is developed for effortless coating onto a variety of substrates and further amine funcationalizations. Significantly, this photopatterned and insulated film enables the in situ generation of PEDOT vertical circuits, providing a novel means to create interlayer electrical connectivity with anti&#8208;fouling property and air&#8208;permeability for 3D electronic devices.







Abstract
This study describes the development of a new type of amine&#8208;reactive superhydrophobic (RSH) film that is facilely coated on various substrates using a single&#8208;step process, while the versatility of this RSH film offers a reliable solution for efficient formation of complex and robust interlayer electrical connectivity (IEC) in 3D electronic systems. The excellent spatial controllability of surface amine modification enables the generation of vertical circuits in situ, providing a distinct way to connect circuits located on different layers. Moreover, the inherent superhydrophobicity and porosity exhibit the required anti&#8208;fouling and breathability properties, making the RSH&#8208;based IEC well&#8208;suited for applications where exposure to environmental gas and liquid contaminants is likely. This approach provides another avenue towards the development of IEC in 3D flexible integrated electronics, opening up new possibilities for the advancement of this field.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Magnesiophilic Coordination Layer Stabilizes Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg0 atoms are exposed to electrolyte solvents, impurities, and anions, leading to side reactions on the anode surface and further passivation. In this work, aniline with magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg0 forms a benign coordination layer to protect the Mg anode from these side reactions.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are seriously plagued by the direct exposure of the Mg anode to the electrolyte components, leading to spontaneous and electrochemical side reactions and interfacial passivation. Herein, a benign coordination layer is constructed at the Mg/electrolyte interface where aniline with a strong magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg is chosen as representative, which has higher adsorption energy than DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane) and trace water. This Mg coordination environment mitigates side reactions, forming a non&#8208;passivating interface consisting of aniline and much fewer by&#8208;products after several cycles. Therefore, the Mg symmetrical cell operates with a low overpotential and uniform Mg0 deposition. This interfacial coordination can also be adopted for Mg anode protection in various electrolyte cases of Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte systems.

         <title>Minor Actinides Can Replace Essential Lanthanides in Bacterial Life
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylotrophic bacteria utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their metabolism: Studies with two bacterial lanthanide&#8208;using strains demonstrate that the trivalent radioactive 5&#8201;f elements americium and curium can support growth. Also, catalytic activity of the lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenases with actinides is shown. For the first time it is established that actinides can play a beneficial role in biological metabolism.







Abstract
Certain f&#8208;block elements&#8212;the lanthanides&#8212;have biological relevance in the context of methylotrophic bacteria. The respective strains incorporate these 4&#8201;f elements into the active site of one of their key metabolic enzymes, a lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase. In this study, we investigated whether actinides, the radioactive 5&#8201;f elements, can replace the essential 4&#8201;f elements in lanthanide&#8208;dependent bacterial metabolism. Growth studies with Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV and the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 &#916;mxaF mutant demonstrate that americium and curium support growth in the absence of lanthanides. Moreover, strain SolV favors these actinides over late lanthanides when presented with a mixture of equal amounts of lanthanides together with americium and curium. Our combined in vivo and in vitro results establish that methylotrophic bacteria can utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their one&#8208;carbon metabolism if they possess the correct size and a +III oxidation state.

Moreover, strain SolV favors these actinides over late lanthanides when presented with a mixture of equal amounts of lanthanides together with americium and curium. Our combined &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results establish that methylotrophic bacteria can utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their one-carbon metabolism if they possess the correct size and a +III oxidation state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Pore Polarization to Boost Ethane/Ethylene Separation Performance in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pore polarity tuning strategy has been realized through the solid&#8208;state transformation of graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, which significantly improves the performance of one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixture.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) show great potential in energy&#8208;saving C2H6/C2H4 separation, but there are few examples of one&#8208;step acquisition of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 because it is still difficult to achieve the reverse&#8208;order adsorption of C2H6 and C2H4. In this work, we boost the C2H6/C2H4 separation performance in two graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like HOFs by tuning pore polarization. Upon heating, an in situ solid phase transformation can be observed from HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (DMA=dimethylamine cation) to HOF&#8208;NBDA, accompanied with transformation of the electronegative skeleton into neutral one. As a result, the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA has become nonpolar, which is beneficial to selectively adsorbing C2H6. The difference in the capacities for C2H6 and C2H4 is 23.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 for HOF&#8208;NBDA, and the C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio is 136&#8201;%, which are much higher than those for HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.0&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 108&#8201;% respectively). Practical breakthrough experiments demonstrate HOF&#8208;NBDA could produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) mixture with a high productivity of 29.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, which is about five times as high as HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.4&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1). In addition, in situ breakthrough experiments and theoretical calculations indicate the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA is beneficial to preferentially capture C2H6 and thus boosts selective separation of C2H6/C2H4.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Enantioconvergence and Kinetic Resolution in the Coupling of Tertiary Cyclobutenols with Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable transformation including an enantioconvergent or a kinetic resolution step was used in the reaction of tertiary cyclobutenols with arylboroxines under a Ni/modified SPINOL catalytic system. This reaction allows the direct use of free hydroxyl groups as leaving groups while the strained ring remains untouched and provides enantioenriched cyclobutenes having a tertiary hydroxyl or an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
We report that a nickel catalyst system with a modified 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol&#8208;phosphoramidite (SPINOL) as the chiral ligand can enable the coupling of tertiary cyclobutenols and arylboroxines in an enantioconvergent manner, providing cyclobutenes with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in good yields (up to 84&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the catalytic system can be applied in the kinetic resolution of cyclobutenols under slightly modified conditions, giving enantioenriched tertiary cyclobutenols with an s factor of up to &gt;200. The reaction uses free hydroxyl groups as the leaving group without additional activation while the strained ring remains untouched. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the inherent discrepant reactivity of the two enantiomers is the key to the controllable enantioconvergent and kinetic resolution process.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Channel Lanthanide Nanocomposites for Customized Synergistic Treatment of Orthotopic Multi&#8208;Tumor Cases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a multichannel lanthanide&#8208;based nanocomposite, the tumor ablation efficiency can be predicted through fluorescence imaging for customized synergistic ablation of multiple orthotopic breast tumors simultaneously under a non&#8208;uniform light field. With a customized irradiation prescription, it shows better therapeutic efficiency and recovery rate than traditional therapeutic methods.







Abstract
Simultaneous photothermal ablation of multiple tumors is limited by unpredictable photo&#8208;induced apoptosis, caused by individual intratumoral differences. Here, a multi&#8208;channel lanthanide nanocomposite was used to achieve tailored synergistic treatment of multiple subcutaneous orthotopic tumors under non&#8208;uniform whole&#8208;body infrared irradiation prescription. The nanocomposite reduces intratumoral glutathione by simultaneously activating the fluorescence and photothermal channels. The fluorescence provides individual information on different tumors, allowing customized prescriptions to be made. This enables optimal induction of hyperthermia and dosage of chemo drugs, to ensure treatment efficacy, while avoiding overtherapy. With an accessional therapeutic laser system, customized synergistic treatment of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer cases with multiple tumors is possible with both high efficacy and minimized side effects.

         <title>A Simple, Selective, and General Catalyst for Ring Closing Depolymerization of Polyesters and Polycarbonates for Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters and polycarbonates are depolymerized using the combination of zinc dichloride and polyethylene glycol as a catalyst under reactive distillation conditions carried out at temperatures significantly below the ceiling temperature of the polymers evaluated. Selective polyester depolymerization occurred in the presence of other polymer classes, thereby demonstrating the promise for using the chemistry for the chemical recycling of plastics.







Abstract
The ability to efficiently and selectively process mixed polymer waste is important to address the growing plastic waste problem. Herein, we report that the combination of ZnCl2 and an additive amount of poly(ethylene glycol) under vacuum can readily and selectively depolymerize polyesters and polycarbonates with high ceiling temperatures (Tc&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) back to their constitute monomers. Mechanistic experiments implicate a random chain scission mechanism and a catalyst structure containing one equivalent of ZnCl2 per ethylene glycol repeat unit in the poly(ethylene glycol).

     alt="A Simple, Selective, and General Catalyst for Ring Closing Depolymerization of Polyesters and Polycarbonates for Chemical Recycling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyesters and polycarbonates are depolymerized using the combination of zinc dichloride and polyethylene glycol as a catalyst under reactive distillation conditions carried out at temperatures significantly below the ceiling temperature of the polymers evaluated. Selective polyester depolymerization occurred in the presence of other polymer classes, thereby demonstrating the promise for using the chemistry for the chemical recycling of plastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to efficiently and selectively process mixed polymer waste is important to address the growing plastic waste problem. Herein, we report that the combination of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and an additive amount of poly(ethylene glycol) under vacuum can readily and selectively depolymerize polyesters and polycarbonates with high ceiling temperatures (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) back to their constitute monomers. Mechanistic experiments implicate a random chain scission mechanism and a catalyst structure containing one equivalent of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per ethylene glycol repeat unit in the poly(ethylene glycol). In addition to being general for a wide variety of polyesters and polycarbonates, the catalyst system could selectively depolymerize a polyester in the presence of other commodity plastics, demonstrating how reactive distillation using the ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PEG600 catalyst system can be used to separate mixed plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversing Free&#8208;Electron Transfer of MoS2+x Cocatalyst for Optimizing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Enables High Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To create a beneficial transfer direction for cultivating moderate hydrogen&#8208;atom adsorption/desorption on a co&#8208;catalyst, an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed that optimizes the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. The embedded Au can reverse the free&#8208;electron transfer to MoS2+x to form electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722;, which causes an increased antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy, thus weakening S&#8722;Hads bonds for photocatalytic H2 evolution.







Abstract
The interaction between a co&#8208;catalyst and photocatalyst usually induces spontaneous free&#8208;electron transfer between them, but the effect and regulation of the transfer direction on the hydrogen&#8208;adsorption energy of the active sites have not received attention. Herein, to steer the free&#8208;electron transfer in a favorable direction for weakening S&#8722;Hads bonds of sulfur&#8208;rich MoS2+x, an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed for the first time. The core&#8211;shell Au@MoS2+x cocatalyst was constructed on TiO2 to optimize the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. Research results reveal that the embedded Au can reverse the electron transfer to MoS2+x to generate electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722; active sites, thus increasing the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of S&#8722;Hads in the Au@MoS2+x cocatalyst. Consequently, the increase in the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy effectively destabilizes the H&#8197;1s&#8208;p antibonding orbital and weakens the S&#8722;Hads bond, realizing the expedited desorption of Hads to rapidly generate a lot of visible H2 bubbles. This work delves deep into the latent effect of the photocatalyst carrier on cocatalytic activity.

         <title>Phosphorothioated DNA Engineered Liposomes as a General Platform for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Cell&#8208;Specific Intracellular Delivery and Genome Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;specific and stimuli&#8208;responsive cytosolic protein delivery was achieved through a macromolecular fusion machine composed of protein&#8208;loading liposomes and fusogenic phosphorothioated DNA coatings, which mimic the recognition and stimuli&#8208;responsive conformational changes of viral hemagglutinin. This fusion machine provides a versatile platform for various cell type&#8208;dependent biomacromolecules delivery both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Intracellular protein delivery is highly desirable for protein drug&#8208;based cell therapy. Established technologies suffer from poor cell&#8208;specific cytosolic protein delivery, which hampers the targeting therapy of specific cell populations. A fusogenic liposome system enables cytosolic delivery, but its ability of cell&#8208;specific and controllable delivery is quite limited. Inspired by the kinetics of viral fusion, we designed a phosphorothioated DNA coatings&#8208;modified fusogenic liposome to mimic the function of viral hemagglutinin. The macromolecular fusion machine docks cargo&#8208;loaded liposomes at the membrane of target cells, triggers membrane fusion upon pH or UV light stimuli, and facilitates cytosolic protein delivery. Our results showed efficient cell&#8208;targeted delivery of proteins of various sizes and charges, indicating the phosphorothioated DNA plug&#8208;in unit on liposomes could be a general strategy for spatial&#8208;temporally controllable protein delivery both in vitro and in vivo.

A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion battery prepared by low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate exhibits extraordinary electrochemical stability, as reported by Lei Tian, Caizhen Zhu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302767). The cellulose part in cellulose acetate is like a mountain forest. The esterified side groups are like the Great Wall built between the mountain forest, providing high&#8208;speed and stable transport channels for lithium ions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scrambled but selective polycondensation reaction introduced the simplest route to generate porous poly(aryl thioether)s. Through a multi&#8208;para nucleophilic substitution of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide, temperature&#8208;dependent formation of thioether linkages leads to stepwise transition of the polymers into network structures with controllable porosity and bandgap, as reported by Jeehye Byun, Sheng Li, Cafer&#8197;T. Yavuz et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202304378).

         <title>Methylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Engineered Methyltransferases To Generate Non&#8208;natural Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methyltransferase from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was identified and engineered for late&#8208;stage modifications of the carbon skeleton of terpenes. A variant with three changes in the amino acid sequence was able to produce methylated derivatives of linear terpenoids with high selectivity by C&#8208;methylation of an unactivated alkene. This opens new avenues for the modification of carbon scaffolds in various applications, as demonstrated by Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. In their Communication (e202301601). The artwork was designed by Verena Resch, Graz.

&lt;p&gt;A methyltransferase from the green alga &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; was identified and engineered for late-stage modifications of the carbon skeleton of terpenes. A variant with three changes in the amino acid sequence was able to produce methylated derivatives of linear terpenoids with high selectivity by C-methylation of an unactivated alkene. This opens new avenues for the modification of carbon scaffolds in various applications, as demonstrated by Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. In their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202301601"&gt;e202301601&lt;/a&gt;). The artwork was designed by Verena Resch, Graz.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymerization Accompanying Chirality Transfer in Heterostructures via Living Chain Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of tetraphenylethylene containing glycine (TPE&#8208;G) and/or D&#8208;/L&#8208;alanine moieties leads to the formation of supramolecular multi&#8208;blocks copolymers, such as B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C patterns (BCPs; tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;blocks) by a chain&#8208;growth process. The chirality of the supramolecular BCPs was not only successfully controlled by the chiral seed, but it also transferred to an achiral component during the chain&#8208;growth polymerization, as reported Sung&#8197;Ho Jung, Jong&#8197;Hwa Jung et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202300913).

         <title>Appealing sheath&#8208;core spun high&#8208;performance composite carbon molecular sieve membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are attractive candidates meet energy demands for challenging gas separations. The added ability to maintain such intrinsic properties in an asymmetric morphology with a structure that we term a &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+ Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; asymmetric form offers new opportunities. &#160;For CMS membrane, specifically, the structure provides both selective layer support and low flow resistance even for high feed pressures and fluxes in CO2 removal from natural gas. This capability is unavailable to even rigid glassy polymers due to the much higher modulus of CMS materials. Combining precursor asymmetric hollow fiber formation and optimized pyrolysis creates a defect free CMS proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept membrane for this application. Facile formation of the sheath&#8208;core spun precursor with a 6FDA&#8208;DAM sheath and Matrimid&#174; core also avoids the need to seal defects before or after the carbonization of the precursors. The composite CMS membranes shows CO2/CH4 (50:50) mixed gas feed with an attractive CO2/CH4 selectivity of 64.3 and CO2 permeance of 232 GPU at 35&#8239;&#176;C. A key additional benefit of the approach is reduction in use of the more costly high performance 6FDA&#8208;DAM in a composite sheath&#8208;core CMS membrane with the &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+ Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts, featuring atomically dispersed metals on solid carriers, offer limitless possibilities for new, sustainable transformations in the chemical sector. These materials bridge the gap between organometallic and nanoparticle catalysis and are opening exciting avenues for mimicking metalloenzymes. This Review summarizes the impressive progress and potential knowledge gaps in the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts hold the potential to significantly impact the chemical sector, pushing the boundaries of catalysis in new, uncharted directions. These materials, featuring isolated metal species ligated on solid supports, can exist in many coordination environments, all of which have shown important functions in specific transformations. Their emergence has also provided exciting opportunities for mimicking metalloenzymes and bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This Review outlines the impressive progress made in recent years regarding the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic synthesis. We also illustrate potential knowledge gaps in the search for more sustainable, earth&#8208;abundant single&#8208;atom catalysts for synthetic applications.

         <dc:description>Construction of metal&#8208;organic cages with unique architecture and guest binding abilities is highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of a distorted trigonal cage 1 from a twisted tetratopic ligand (L) and a Pd(II) acceptor. Surprisingly, 1 exhibited a complete structural reorganization of its building units in presence of C70 and C60 to form guest&#8208;encapsulated tetragonal cages, (C70)2@2 and (C60)2@2, respectively. These guest&#8208;bound cages were found to be potential 1O2 generators and the former effectively catalyzed two different varieties of 1O2&#8208;mediated oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of gem&#8208;Dihaloalkanes and Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral cyclopropane derivatives are essential in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery. Their synthesis commonly relies on asymmetric cyclopropanation of diazo compounds, potentially explosive and needing stabilizing substituents. Thus, asymmetric catalytic transformations of non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping, non&#8208;linear effect, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is limited by harsh issues such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, low Coulombic efficiency, and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a unique design strategy using &#947;&#8208;valerolactone electrolyte and nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate was reported to solve the above problems. The &#947;&#8208;valerolactone electrolyte with extremely low freezing point and high thermal stability enables the symmetric cells with long cycle life over a wide temperature range (&#8722;50 &#176;C to 80 &#176;C) due to its ability to regulate zinc nucleation and preferential epitaxial growth. Besides, the nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate can also promote a higher Coulombic efficiency over a wide temperature range in contrast to the low Coulombic efficiency of copper substrates with significant irreversible alloying reactions because this unique substrate with excellent chemical stabilization can homogenize the interfacial electron/ion distribution. The optimized zinc metal batteries can operate stably under various temperature conditions (2000 cycles at 30 &#176;C with 66% depth of discharge and 1200 cycles at 80 &#176;C with 50% depth of discharge). This unique electrolyte and substrate design strategy achieves a robust zinc metal battery over a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Supramolecular Framework Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals could modulate the polarization of light and are widely used as polarizers, waveplates, optical isolators, etc. To date, commercial birefringent crystals have been exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds such as &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4 with birefringence of about 0.12. Herein, we report a new hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework, namely, Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#183;8H2O, which exhibits exceptionally large birefringence up to about 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, the birefringence of Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#183;8H2O is significantly larger than those of all commercial birefringent crystals and is the largest among hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework crystals. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that the exceptional birefringence is mainly ascribed to strong covalent interactions within (H2C6N7O3)&#8208; organic ligands and the perfect coplanarity between them. Given the rich structural diversity and tunability, hydrogen bonded supramolecular frameworks would offer unprecedented opportunities beyond the traditional purely inorganic oxides for birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Cyclization by the Use of Acylammonium Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although cyclic peptides have become increasingly important as drugs, the most conventional peptide cyclization using moderately active coupling agents suffers from a lot of waste, high cost as well as long reaction times and burdensome purification. Here, we report an unconventional approach to peptide cyclization that uses acylammonium species generated from inexpensive and less wasteful Me2NBn and ClCO2i&#8208;Pr. Using this approach, we observed a desired rapid activation of C&#8208;terminal of cyclization precursors by acylammonium species, and achieved a rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides, which included a difficult cyclization via N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The ease of purification, productivities, and reaction mass efficiencies of our approach were significantly superior to those in previous reports. We synthesized a previously reported versicotide D analogue and our data indicated that its stereochemistry should be revised.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photoresponsive materials offer excellent spatiotemporal control over biological processes and the emerging phototherapeutic methods are expected to have significant effects on targeted cancer therapies. Recent examples show that combination of photoactivatable approaches with bioorthogonal chemistry enhances the precision of targeted phototherapies and profound implications are anticipated particularly in the treatment of disperse/diffuse tumors. The extra level of on&#8208;target selectivity and improved spatial/temporal control considerably intensified related bioorthogonally assisted phototherapy research.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Radical&#8208;mediated Photocatalysis for Lignocellulosic Biomass Conversion into Value&#8208;added Chemicals and Hydrogen: Facts, Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic biomass conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels is considered one of the hottest ongoing research and industrial topics toward sustainable development. In short, this process can cleave C&#946;&#8208;O/C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; bonds in lignin to aromatic platform chemicals, and further conversion of the polysaccharides to other platform chemicals and H2. From the chemistry point of view, the optimization of the unique cooperative interplay of radical oxidation species (which are activated via molecular oxygen species, ROSs) and substrate&#8208;derived radical intermediates by appropriate control of their type and/or yield is key to the selective production of desired products. Technically, several challenges have been raised that face successful real&#8208;world applications. This review aims to discuss the recently reported mechanistic pathways toward selective biomass conversion through the optimization of ROSs behavior and materials/system design. On top of that, through a SWOT analysis, we critically discussed this technology from both chemistry and technological viewpoints to help the scientists and engineers bridge the gap between lab&#8208;scale and large&#8208;scale production.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#160;the gas phase, thermal activation of supramolecular assemblies such as host&#8208;guest complexes leads commonly to noncovalent dissociation into the individual components. Chemical reactions, for example of encapsulated guest molecules, are only found in exceptional cases. As observed by mass spectrometry, when 1&#8208;amino&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;2&#8208;ene (DBOA) is complexed by the macrocycle&#160;b&#8208;cyclodextrin, its protonated complex undergoes collision&#8208;induced dissociation into its components, the conventional reaction pathway. Inside the macrocyclic cavity of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), a competitive chemical reaction of monoprotonated DBOA takes place upon thermal activation, namely a stepwise homolytic covalent bond cleavage with the elimination of N2, while the doubly protonated CB7&#8226;DBOA complex undergoes an inner&#8208;phase elimination of ethylene, a concerted, electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction. These chemical reaction pathways stand in contrast to the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of uncomplexed monoprotonated DBOA, for which an elimination of NH3&#160;predominates upon collision&#8208;induced activation, as a heterolytic bond cleavage reaction. The combined results, which can be rationalized in terms of organic&#8208;chemical reaction mechanisms and density&#8208;function theoretical calculations, demonstrate that chemical reactions in the gas phase can be steered chemoselectively through noncovalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Triggered Pore Size Tuning in Photoswitching Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Low Energy CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, photo switching porous materials have been widely reported for low energy costed CO2 capture and release via simply remoted light controlling method. However, most reported photo responsive CO2 adsorbents relied on metal organic framework (MOFs) functionalisation with photochromic moieties, and MOF adsorbents still suffered from chemically and thermally unstable issues. Thus, further metal free and highly stable organic photoresponsive adsorbents are necessary to be developed. Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), because of their high porosity and stability, have attracted great attention for CO2 capture. Considering the high CO2 uptake capacity and structural tunability of CTFs, it suggests high potential to fabricate the photoswitching CTF materials by the same functionalisation method as MOFs. Herein, the first series of photo switching CTFs were developed for low energy CO2 capture and release. Apart from that, the CO2 switching efficiency could be doubled either through the azobenzene numbers adjusting method or through the previously reported structural alleviation strategy. Furthermore, the pore size distribution of azobenzene functionalised PCTFs also could be tuned under UV exposure, which may contribute to the UV light induced decrease of CO2 uptake capacity. These photoswitching CTFs represented a new kind of porous polymers for low energy costed CO2 capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers based on riboswitch architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) such as Spinach or Mango can bind small fluorogens and activate their fluorescence. Here, we adopt a switching mechanism otherwise found in riboswitches and use it to engineer switchable FLAPs that can be activated or repressed by trigger oligonucleotides or small metabolites. The fluorophore binding pocket of the FLAPs comprises guanine (G) quadruplexes, whose critical nucleotides can be sequestered by corresponding anti&#8208;FLAP sequences, leading to an inactive conformation and thus preventing association with the fluorophore. We modified the FLAPs with designed toehold hairpins that carry either an anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence within the loop region. The addition of an input RNA molecule triggers a toehold&#8208;mediated strand invasion process that refolds the FLAP into an active or inactive configuration. Several of our designs display close&#8208;to&#8208;zero leak signals and correspondingly high ON/OFF fluorescence ratios. We also modified purine aptamers to sequester a partial anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence to control the formation of the fluorogen&#8208;binding conformation, resulting in FLAPs whose fluorescence is activated or deactivated in the presence of guanine or adenine. We demonstrate that switching modules can be easily combined to generate FLAPs whose fluorescence depends on several inputs with different types of input logic.</dc:description>

         <title>Darobactin B Stabilises a Lateral&#8208;Closed Conformation of the BAM Complex in E. coli Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM complex) is essential for outer membrane protein (OMP) folding in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, and represents a promising antimicrobial target. Several conformational states of BAM have been reported, but all have been obtained under conditions which lack the unique features and complexity of the outer membrane (OM). Here, we use Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR, or DEER) spectroscopy distance measurements to interrogate the conformational ensemble of the BAM complex in E. coli cells. We show that BAM adopts a broad ensemble of conformations in the OM, while in the presence of the antibiotic darobactin B (DAR&#8208;B), BAM's conformational equilibrium shifts to a restricted ensemble consistent with the lateral closed state. Our in&#8208;cell PELDOR findings are supported by new cryoEM structures of BAM in the presence and absence of DAR&#8208;B. This work demonstrates the utility of PELDOR to map conformational changes in BAM within its native cellular environment.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable Van der Waals Heterostructures through Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (2D vdWHs) have recently gained widespread attention because of their abundant and exotic properties, which open up many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, practical applications remain challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput techniques for fabricating high&#8208;quality vdWHs. Here, we demonstrate a general electrochemical strategy to prepare solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;quality vdWHs, in which electrostatic forces drive the stacking of electrochemically exfoliated individual assemblies with intact structures and clean interfaces into vdWHs with strong interlayer interactions. Thanks to the excellent combination of strong light absorption, interfacial charge transfer, and decent charge transport properties in individual layers, thin&#8208;film photodetectors based on graphene/In2Se3 vdWHs exhibit great promise for NIR photodetection, owing to a high responsivity (267 mA W&#8208;1), fast rise (72 ms) and decay (426 ms) times under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. This approach enables various hybrid systems, including graphene/In2Se3, graphene/MoS2 and graphene/MoSe2 vdWHs, providing a broad avenue for exploring emerging electronic, photonic, and exotic quantum phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Interfaces in High&#8208;Temperature NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries via Tuning Terminal Alkyl Chains of Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether electrolytes are promising for lithium metal batteries. Despite the intensive research in recent years, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ether electrolytes still cannot form reliable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in NCM811&#8208;Li batteries at diluted concentrations, especially in those operating at elevated temperatures. We report a simple but effective strategy to break this bottleneck and stabilize interfaces in high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li batteries in ether electrolytes. We propose that by gradually extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to n&#8208;butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes is improved. An anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is realized at a concentration of 1 M. Accordingly, the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208; /cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface is achieved. Additionally, the phase transition and structural degradation of NCM811 cathode are alleviated. Consequently, in the ethylene glycol dibutyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte, the Coulombic efficiency for Li&#8208;Cu cells working at 60 &#176;C is boosted to 99.41% with a cycling life of over 200 cycles. The lifespan of high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li cells is prolonged by more than 400% with a stable average Coulombic efficiency of 99.77% at quasi&#8208;practical conditions of 50 &#181;m Li, lean electrolyte of 10 &#181;L mAh&#8722;1, and medium&#8208;high cathode loading of &gt;2.2 mAh cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Modulating the Interfacial Hydrogen&#8722;Bond Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly efficient and stable electrode&#8722;electrolyte interface for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis remains highly challenging. Inhibition of the side reaction of competitive 4e&#8211; oxygen reduction to H2O is essential to obtain highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis. Instead of catalyst modification to hinder excessive hydrogenation of H2O2, we propose that the addition of a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the KOH electrolyte enables the improvement of the selectivity and activity of H2O2 electrosynthesis simultaneously. Spectral characterization and molecular simulation confirm that the formation of hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules at the electrode&#8722;electrolyte interface can reduce the activity of water dissociation into active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment hinders excessive hydrogenation for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thus improving the selectivity of 2e&#8211; ORR and achieving over 90% selectivity of H2O2. This work highlights the importance of regulating the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bond environment by organic molecules as a means of boosting electrochemical performance in aqueous electrosynthesis and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyethylene Incorporating Diels&#8208;Alder Comonomers: A &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; Strategy for Chemically Recyclable Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefins with periodic unsaturation in the backbone chain are sought after for synthesizing chemically recyclable polymers or telechelic polyolefin macromonomers. Here we introduce a bottomup synthesis of unsaturated high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) via copolymerization of ethylene with dimethyl 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208; 2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylate followed by post&#8208;polymerization retro&#8208; Diels&#8208;Alder to unveil hidden double bonds in the polymer backbone. The incorporation of this &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; comonomer was varied and a series of unsaturated HDPE polymers with block lengths of 1.2, 1.9, and 3.5 kDa between double bonds was synthesized. Crossmetathesis of unsaturated HDPE samples with 2&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylate yielded telechelic ester terminated PE macromonomers suitable for the preparation of ester&#8208;linked PE. These materials were depolymerized and repolymerized, making them suitable candidates for chemical recycling. The ester&#8208;linked PE displayed thermal and mechanical properties comparable to commercial HDPE.</dc:description>

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOFs Confining Zwitterionic Sulfamic Acid as Proton Source and Conducting Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A few metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), which typically use strong acids as proton sources, display superprotonic conductivity (~10&#8722;1 S cm&#8722;1); however, they are rare due to the instability of MOFs in highly acidic conditions. For the first time, we report superprotonic conductivity using a moderately acidic guest, zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA), which is encapsulated in MOF&#8208;808 and MIL&#8208;101. HSA acts not only as a proton source but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium due to its extensive hydrogen bonding ability and zwitterion effect. A new sustained concentration gradient method results in higher HSA encapsulation compared to conventional methods, producing 10HSA@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(bSA)2 and 8HSA@MIL&#8208;101. These MOFs show impressive superprotonic conductivity of 2.47 &#215; 10&#8722;1 and 3.06 &#215; 10&#8722;1 S cm&#8722;1, respectively, at 85 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity, and maintain stability for 7 days.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;enriched scaffolds have demonstrated unique features and promising performance in the field of catalysis towards the activation of small gas molecules. However, there is still a lack of facile approaches capable of achieving high B doping and abundant porous channels. Herein, construction of boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;enriched nanoporous &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks (BN&#8208;NCNs) was achieved via a facile ionothermal polymerization procedure of hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile [HAT(CN)6] catalyzed by sodium borohydride. The as&#8208;produced BN&#8208;NCN scaffolds were featured by high heteroatoms doping (B: up to 23 wt%, N: up to 17 wt%) and permanent porosity (surface area up to 759 m2 g&#8208;1). With the B species acting as the active Lewis acid sites and N species acting as the active Lewis base sites, those BN&#8208;NCNs delivered attractive catalytic efficiency towards H2 activation/dissociation in both gaseous and liquid phase, performing as efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysts in hydrogenation procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Fluorogenic RNA Nanozipper Enables Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Single Viral mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a genetically encoded RNA nanozipper that allows real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs by in situ self&#8208;assembly in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translation elongation rates of viral mRNAs. This can provide an effective method to monitor the translation activity of individual viral mRNAs in live cells.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of individual viral mRNA translation activities in live cells is essential to obtain critical details of viral mRNA dynamics and to detect its transient responses to environmental stress. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are powerful tools for real&#8208;time imaging of mRNA in live cells, but monitoring the translation activity of individual mRNAs remains a challenge due to their intrinsic photophysical properties. Here, we develop a genetically encoded turn&#8208;on 3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI)&#8208;binding RNA nanozipper with superior brightness and high photostability by in situ self&#8208;assembly of multiple nanozippers along single mRNAs. The nanozipper enables real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translational elongation rate of viral mRNAs.

         <title>Tuning the Crystal Phase to Form MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel for Highly Efficient Syngas to Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MnGaOx exhibits a strongly crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;dependent activity. The syngas to light olefins activity is significantly enhanced by forming a spinel crystal phase (MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel) when compared to the activity over a solid solution oxide (MnGaOx&#8208;SS) within the catalyst concept of metal oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO). Key: Hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP), Face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC).







Abstract
The oxide&#8211;zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept has been demonstrated in an increasing number of studies as an alternative avenue for direct syngas conversion to light olefins. We report that face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel gives 40&#8201;% CO conversion, 81&#8201;% light olefins selectivity, and a 0.17&#8197;g&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 space&#8208;time yield of light olefins in combination with SAPO&#8208;18. In comparison, solid solution MnGaOx (characterized by Mn&#8208;doped hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) Ga2O3) with a similar chemical composition gives a much inferior activity, i.e., the specific surface activity is one order of magnitude lower than the spinel oxide. Photoluminescence (PL), in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superior activity of MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel can be attributed to its higher reducibility (higher concentration of oxygen vacancies) and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, which facilitates the dissociation of the C&#8722;O bond via a more efficient ketene&#8211;acetate pathway to light olefins.

         <title>A Universal Molten Salt Method for Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;rich Cathode towards Single&#8208;crystalline Li&#8208;rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct upcycling of a spent Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.88Co0.095Al0.025O2, NCA) to a single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich cathode is achieved for Li&#8208;ion batteries in a binary LiOH&#8208;Na2SO4 system. The regenerated NCA exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of long&#8208;term cyclability, high rate performance and low polarization. This strategy can be extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied Li compositions.







Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing pursuit for high&#8208;value output in recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), traditional recycling methods of cathodes tend to be obsolete because of the complicated procedures.

&lt;p&gt;With ever-increasing pursuit for high-value output in recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), traditional recycling methods of cathodes tend to be obsolete because of the complicated procedures. Herein, we first upcycle spent polycrystal LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.095&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.025&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (S-NCA) to high value-added single-crystalline and Li-rich cathode materials through a simple but feasible LiOH-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; eutectic molten salt strategy.

         <title>Technological Pathways to Produce Compressed and Highly Pure Hydrogen from Solar Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review gives an overview of the technological pathways for direct and indirect production of H2 from solar power within the frame of the Innovation Pool project &#8220; Solar H2: Highly Pure and Compressed &#8221;. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal and plasma reactors are described in terms of their principle of operation and specifics regarding to the quality (purity, pressure) of produced H2.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) produced from renewables will have a growing impact on the global energy dynamics towards sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral standards. The share of green H2 is still too low to meet the net&#8208;zero target, while the demand for high&#8208;quality hydrogen continues to rise. These factors amplify the need for economically viable H2 generation technologies. The present article aims at evaluating the existing technologies for high&#8208;quality H2 production based on solar energy. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal reactors and plasma conversion utilize solar power directly or indirectly (as carbon&#8208;neutral electrons) and are reviewed from the perspective of their current development level, technical limitations and future potential.

         <title>Genetic Fusion of Thermoresponsive Polypeptides with UCST&#8208;type Behavior Mediates 1D Assembly of Coiled&#8208;Coil Bundlemers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides were functionalized with thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths and produced via biosynthetic methods in bacterial expression hosts. Interactions between RLPs upon cooling below their upper critical solution temperature (UCST) resulted in nanofibrillar assembly.







Abstract
Thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths were genetically fused to two different computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides with distinct thermal stability, to develop new strategies to assemble coiled coil peptides via temperature&#8208;triggered phase separation of the RLP units. Their successful production in bacterial expression hosts was verified via gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) turbidimetry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements confirmed the stability of the coiled coils and showed that the thermosensitive phase behavior of the RLPs was preserved in the genetically fused hybrid polypeptides. Cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and coarse&#8208;grained modeling revealed that functionalizing the coiled coils with thermoresponsive RLPs leads to their thermally triggered noncovalent assembly into nanofibrillar assemblies.

         <title>Antioxidant and Prooxidant Nanozymes: From Cellular Redox Regulation to Next&#8208;Generation Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review offers an overview of the recent development of redox&#8208;active nanozymes, primarily highlighting antioxidant and prooxidant nanozymes and their therapeutic significance in oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;mediated disorders with an outlook on the current challenges and future trends. The insight provided should aid the development of next&#8208;generation therapeutic nanozymes for translation into clinical settings.







Abstract
Nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity, have attracted tremendous interest in recent years owing to their ability to replace natural enzymes in various biomedical applications, such as biosensing, therapeutics, drug delivery, and bioimaging. In particular, the nanozymes capable of regulating the cellular redox status by mimicking the antioxidant enzymes in mammalian cells are of great therapeutic significance in oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;mediated disorders. As the distinction of physiological oxidative stress (oxidative eustress) and pathological oxidative stress (oxidative distress) occurs at a fine borderline, it is a great challenge to design nanozymes that can differentially sense the two extremes in cells, tissues and organs and mediate appropriate redox chemical reactions. In this Review, we summarize the advances in the development of redox&#8208;active nanozymes and their biomedical applications. We primarily highlight the therapeutic significance of the antioxidant and prooxidant nanozymes in various disease model systems, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. The future perspectives of this emerging area of research and the challenges associated with the biomedical applications of nanozymes are described.

         <title>Elucidation of a Dearomatization Route in the Biosynthesis of Oxysporidinone Involving a TenA&#8208;like Cytochrome P450 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dearomative biosynthetic route from sambutoxin to oxysporidinone in Fusarium oxysporum, in which two enzymes act sequentially and repeatedly on the phenol moiety of the substrate, was elucidated. OsdM, a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 enzyme, oxidizes the phenol ring and forms a [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN then catalyzes two successive ene reduction steps, which are followed by another hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by OsdM.







Abstract
Oxidative dearomatization of phenols is an important transformation for synthesis of complex molecules. Oxysporidinone and related 2&#8208;pyridones feature a hydroxy&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone ring, which has been proposed to form by phenol dearomatization, although the details of the biochemical process are still unknown. In this study, we identified the oxysporidinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum by regulator activation and gene knockout studies. Through in vivo and in vitro studies, we confirmed that the phenol dearomatization process involves two enzymes. OsdM, a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 with expected ring&#8208;expansion activity, converts the phenol ring and the 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone core into an unexpected fused [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN, on the other hand, catalyzes two successive ene reduction reactions, followed by hydroxylation by OsdM. This new route enriches current knowledge on enzymatic phenol dearomatization and the mechanism of TenA&#8208;like P450s.

         <title>Dual Photochemical H&#8208;Atom Transfer and Cobalt Catalysis for the Desaturative Synthesis of Phenols from Cyclohexanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic photocatalytic H&#8208;atom transfer and cobalt dual catalysis enables the desaturative synthesis of phenols from cyclohexanone derivatives by formal removal of four H&#8208;atoms.







Abstract
Phenols are integral aromatic molecules widely encountered in the structure of natural products and routinely utilised for the synthesis of high&#8208;value materials. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult, especially when their functionalization pattern does not match the intrinsic reactivity leveraged by electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Here, we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach for phenol synthesis using saturated cyclohexanone precursors. This process operates at ambient temperature, under simple purple light irradiation, and features a dual catalytic manifold carrying four sequential H&#8208;atom transfer processes.

         <title>Outstanding Quadratic to Septic Optical Nonlinearity at Dipolar Alkynylmetal&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Alkynylruthenium&#8208;15&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;functionalized nickel porphyrins exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearities and outstanding two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections. The key optical transitions have been analyzed and their impact on the quadratic to septic nonlinearities has been suggested.







Abstract
Porphyrins are important macrocycles with applications in several areas including therapy, catalysis, and sensing. Strong nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are the key to fully exploiting the potential of these biocompatible molecules. We herein report that certain metal&#8208;alkynyl donor/nitro acceptor&#8208;functionalized porphyrins are attractive candidates for NLO applications. We show that specific examples exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearity, exceptional two&#8208;photon absorption, and outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption, and we report the first porphyrins that exhibit four&#8208;photon absorption. The two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption maxima are found at the corresponding multiples of linear absorption bands that time&#8208;dependent density functional theory assigns as admixtures of porphyrin&#8208;localized &#960;*&#8592;&#960; and donor&#8208;porphyrin to porphyrin&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer transitions.

         <title>A Widespread Glycosidase Confers Lobophorin Resistance and Host&#8208;Dependent Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural diversification of lobophorins (LOBs) in S.&#8197;coelicolor M1154/pCSG5560 through glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation was unexpectedly found to be correlated with cross&#8208;talk between the endogenous glycosidase KijX and the products encoded by the exogenous lob BGC. KijX homologues are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs as a resistance mechanism to detoxify LOBs.







Abstract
Identifying new environmental resistance determinants is significant to combat rising antibiotic resistance. Herein we report the unexpected correlation of a lobophorin (LOB) resistance&#8208;related glycosidase KijX with the host&#8208;dependent chemical diversity of LOBs, by a process of glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation. KijX homologues are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs. The crystal structure of AcvX (a KijX homologue) shows a similar fold to that of the glycoside hydrolase family 113 and a special negatively charged groove to accommodate and deglycosylate LOBs. Antagonistic assays indicate kijX as a defense weapon of actinomycetes to combat LOB producers in environment, reflecting an elegant coevolution relationship. Our study provides insight into the KijX&#8208;related glycosidases as preexisting resistance determinants and represents an example of resistance genes accidentally integrated into natural product assembly.

         <title>Chemical Solutions to the Current Polycrisis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 2019, IUPAC started the &#8220;Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry&#8221; initiative. This article reviews the impact of the initiative and how it contributes to different areas, including sustainability, technology transfer, and education.







Abstract
In the past 15&#8197;years, we've experienced an unprecedented series of crises, including financial (2008), health (2020), and most recently the supply chain disruptions and the energy emergency in Europe, caused by the war in Ukraine (2022). On top of that, climate change still poses a serious threat to our lives and our planet. These interconnected challenges create tremendous societal problems and compromise the viability of the chemical industry in an environment of price volatility and high inflation. Thus, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has launched a series of actions to tackle this and raise awareness of the role of chemistry in solving our major threats. Since 2019, IUPAC has identified the &#8220;Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry&#8221; to connect chemical researchers with industry, bridging the gap between science and innovation, maintaining the current competitiveness of the chemical industry, as well as tackling our most pressing global challenges.

         <title>C64 Nanographene Tetraimide&#8212;A Receptor for Phthalocyanines with Subnanomolar Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted phthalocyanines are insoluble and thus challenging to dissolve as monomers in solution. Here a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy is described to solubilize phthalocyanines in organic solvents by complexation with a C64 nanographene tetraimide. A subnanomolar binding affinity of C64 nanographene&#8211;phthalocyanine complex allowed the capture of phthalocyanines into the solution phase.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are extensively used by the dye and pigment industry and in photovoltaic and photodynamic therapy research due to their intense absorption of visible light, outstanding stability, and versatility. As pigments, the unsubstituted phthalocyanines are insoluble owing to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions, which causes limitations for the solution chemistry for both free base and metalated phthalocyanines. Here we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to dissolve phthalocyanines into solution. C64 nanographene tetraimide (1) binds two free base/zinc/copper phthalocyanines in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry to solubilize phthalocyanines as evidenced by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis absorption and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Binding studies using a tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted soluble phthalocyanine revealed binding affinities of up to 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 in tetrachloromethane, relating to a Gibbs free energy of &#8722;52&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Energy decomposition analysis revealed that complexes between 1 and phthalocyanines are stabilized by dispersion interactions followed by electrostatics as well as significant charge&#8208;transfer interactions.

         <title>Electrode Materials for Desalination of Water via Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers a detailed overview of the porous electrode materials utilized in CDI and mCDI for water desalination. While being an efficient and energy economical process, CDI and mCDI face certain challenges concerning their relatively low salt removal capacity and parasitic reactions. To address these issues, this review discusses various cell architectures, electrode materials, and the use of standard experimental parameters that aim to enhance desalination performance.







Abstract
Recent years have seen the emergence of capacitive deionization (CDI) as a promising desalination technique for converting sea and wastewater into potable water, due to its energy efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, its low salt removal capacity and parasitic reactions have limited its effectiveness. As a result, the development of porous carbon nanomaterials as electrode materials have been explored, while taking into account of material characteristics such as morphology, wettability, high conductivity, chemical robustness, cyclic stability, specific surface area, and ease of production. To tackle the parasitic reaction issue, membrane capacitive deionization (mCDI) was proposed which utilizes ion&#8208;exchange membranes coupled to the electrode. Fabrication techniques along with the experimental parameters used to evaluate the desalination performance of different materials are discussed in this review to provide an overview of improvements made for CDI and mCDI desalination purposes

However, its low salt removal capacity and parasitic reactions have limited its effectiveness. As a result, the development of porous carbon nanomaterials as electrode materials have been explored, while taking into account of material characteristics such as morphology, wettability, high conductivity, chemical robustness, cyclic stability, specific surface area, and ease of production. To tackle the parasitic reaction issue, membrane capacitive deionization (mCDI) was proposed which utilizes ion-exchange membranes coupled to the electrode. Fabrication techniques along with the experimental parameters used to evaluate the desalination performance of different materials are discussed in this review to provide an overview of improvements made for CDI and mCDI desalination purposes&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence Control in Asymmetric Terpolymerizations of meso&#8208;Epoxides, CO2, and Phthalic Anhydride: Unprecedented Statistical Ester&#8211;Carbonate Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The statistical terpolymerization of epoxides, CO2 and cyclic anhydrides remains challenging, mainly because epoxide/CO2 and epoxide/anhydride copolymerizations typically proceed at considerably different rates. Herein, we report the syntheses of novel chiral terpolymers with unprecedented statistical distributions of carbonate and ester units (up to 50% junction units) via the one&#8208;pot reaction of cyclohexene oxide, phthalic anhydride, and CO2 under mild conditions using enantiopure bimetallic aluminum&#8208;complex&#8208;based catalyst systems. Notably, all resulting terpolymers exhibited excellent enantioselectivities (&#8805;96% ee) that were independent of the carbonate&#8211;ester distribution. The statistical compositions of the carbonate and ester units in the resulting terpolymers were determined via  1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. Furthermore, thermal properties were tuned by altering the ester content of the chiral terpolymer without influencing the enantioselective ring&#8208;opening step involving the meso&#8208;epoxide. This asymmetric terpolymerization methodology is also compatible with a variety of meso&#8208;epoxides to afford the corresponding terpolymers with 17%&#8211;25% junction units and excellent enantioselectivities (94%&#8211;99% ee). The present study is expected to provide new guidelines for preparing a broad range of biodegradable polymers with excellent enantioselectivities and adjustable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Poisoning and Self&#8208;Recovery of Single&#8208;Site Rh1/Porous Organic Polymer Catalysts for Olefin Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur poisoning and regeneration are global deadly challenges for metal catalysts even at the ppm level. Fewer light was shed on the sulfur poisoning of single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts and their regeneration. Herein, sulfur poisoning but self&#8208;recovery are first presented on an industrialized single&#8208;Rh&#8208;site catalyst (Rh1/POPs). A decreased turnover frequency of Rh1/POPs from 4317 h&#8208;1 to 318 h&#8208;1 was observed in a 1000 ppm H2S co&#8208;feed for ethylene hydroformylation, but it self&#8208;recovered to 4527 h&#8208;1 after withdrawal of H2S, while the rhodium nanoparticles demonstrated poor activity and self&#8208;recovery ability. H2S reduced the charge density of the single Rh atom and lowered its Gibbs free energy with the formation of inactive (SH)Rh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2, which could be regenerated to active HRh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2 after withdrawing H2S. The mechanism and the sulfur&#8208;related structure&#8208;activity relationship were highlighted. This work provides a forward understanding of the heterogeneous ethylene hydroformylation and the sulfur&#8208;poisoned regeneration in the catalysis science of single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Using a Fluorescence Nanoprobe for the Detection and Imaging of Phosphorylation and Glucose Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence assay to analyze the progression of atherosclerosis by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF PCN&#8208;224 with I3&#8722;&#8208;RhB associate. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was used to observe changes in protein phosphorylation and glucose levels in early atherosclerosis mice models.







Abstract
Monitoring the early stage of atherosclerosis (AS) without plaque formation is of great significance. Herein, we developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence nanoprobe to analyze the progression of AS by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF with iodine (I3&#8722;)&#8208;rhodamine B (RhB) associate, which realizes the specific recognition of target object through the metal joint ZrIV and I3&#8722;&#8208;RhB, respectively. We investigated different stages of target object changes in the early non&#8208;plaque stage of AS in blood. It was found that the levels of phosphate and glucose in the blood were higher than those of the normal mice. The results of two&#8208;photon images showed that early AS mice had higher levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a suitable fluorescence tool for further revealing the pathogenesis and progression of AS.

         <title>Layered Monophosphate Tungsten Bronzes [Ba(PO4)2]WmO3m&#8722;3: 2D Metals with Locked Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Instabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the novel MPTB series, thick insulating spacers lock a trigonal symmetry and disrupt tungsten&#8208;oxide blocks. Contrarily to related bronzes, the 2D metallicity is steady down to 1.8&#8197;K, in absence of a charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) instability through Peirls&#8208;like W shifts. However, the 2D Fermi surfaces display the characteristics of hidden nesting, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable 2D metals and CDW order.







Abstract
Phosphate tungsten and molybenum bronzes represent an outstanding class of materials displaying textbook examples of charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) physics among other fundamental properties. Here we report on the existence of a novel structural branch with the general formula [Ba(PO4)2][WmO3m&#8722;3] (m=3, 4 and 5) denominated &#8242;layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes&#8242; (L&#8208;MPTB). It results from thick [Ba(PO4)2]4&#8722; spacer layers disrupting the cationic metal&#8208;oxide 2D units and enforcing an overall trigonal structure. Their symmetries are preserved down to 1.8&#8197;K and the compounds show metallic behaviour with no clear anomaly as a function of temperature. However, their electronic structure displays the characteristic Fermi surface of previous bronzes derived from 5d W states with hidden nesting properties. By analogy with previous bronzes, such a Fermi surface should result into CDW order. Evidence of CDW order was only indirectly observed in the low&#8208;temperature specific heat, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable 2D metals and CDW order.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Single&#8208;Entity Electrochemistry Enables Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry has been shown to be superior to conventional ensemble electrochemistry for studies of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis. This is due to differences in the relative positions of the Fermi levels of the plasmonic particles and the working electrode between the conventional ensemble and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry setups.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC), based on a combination of localized surface plasmon resonance excitation and an electrochemical bias applied to a plasmonic material, can result in improved electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion compared to conventional electrocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry (SEE) for investigating the intrinsic activity of plasmonic catalysts at the single&#8208;particle level using glucose electrooxidation and oxygen reduction on gold nanoparticles as model reactions. We show that in conventional ensemble measurements, plasmonic effects have minimal impact on photocurrents. We suggest that this is due to the continuous equilibration of the Fermi level (EF) of the deposited gold nanoparticles with the EF of the working electrode, leading to fast neutralization of hot carriers by the measuring circuit. The photocurrents detected in the ensemble measurements are primarily caused by photo&#8208;induced heating of the supporting electrode material. In SEE, the EF of suspended gold nanoparticles is unaffected by the working electrode potential. As a result, plasmonic effects are the dominant source of photocurrents under SEE experimental conditions.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Absorbing B,N&#8208;Heteroarene as Photosensitizer for High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first B,N&#8208;heteroarene&#8208;based NIR photosensitizer with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) characters has been designed and synthesized, which enables heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion with a high upconversion quantum yield (2.9&#8201;%, upper limit 50&#8201;%) and the record&#8208;large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (1.03&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers is highly desirable for a variety of emerging applications. However, the development of NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC with a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift is extremely challenging because of the energy loss during the intersystem crossing (ISC). Here, we develop the first NIR&#8208;absorbing B,N&#8208;heteroarene&#8208;based sensitizer (BNS) with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) characters to achieve efficient NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC. The small energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states (0.14&#8197;eV) of BNS suppresses the ISC energy loss, and its long&#8208;delayed fluorescence lifetime (115&#8197;&#956;s) contributes to efficient triplet energy transfer. As a result, the largest anti&#8208;Stokes shift (1.03&#8197;eV) among all heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;activatable TTA&#8208;UC systems is obtained with a high TTA&#8208;UC quantum yield of 2.9&#8201;% (upper limit 50&#8201;%).

         <title>Design of a Bilateral Disulfurating Reagent for Unsymmetrical Polysulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilateral disulfurating reagent is designed, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8722;S bonds. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride, natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8208;linked with S&#8722;S bonds. Some products of this work showed good antibacterial activities.







Abstract
In this study, we designed a bilateral disulfurating reagent via S&#8722;S motif &#8220;snip and stitch&#8221; processes, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8722;S bonds. The reagent is readily synthesized in high yield using a one&#8208;step reaction from easily available starting materials and is air&#8208;stable. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride were sequentially installed on either side of the S&#8722;S motif. Natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8208;linked with S&#8722;S bonds. Notably, the disulfurating reagent can be used in cyclic disulfide synthesis. At last, some desired products of this work showed good antibacterial activities, which could be employed as novel candidates to control plant pathogenic bacteria.

         <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Lipid Nanoparticles for Improved Messenger RNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticle containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II Cy&#8208;lipid was developed for potentiating mRNA translation efficiency through a stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.







Abstract
Endosomal escape remains a central issue limiting the high protein expression of mRNA therapeutics. Here, we present second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II dye conjugated lipid (Cy&#8208;lipid) for potentiating mRNA delivery efficiency via a stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy. In acidic endosomal microenvironment, Cy&#8208;lipid is protonated and turns on NIR&#8208;II absorption for light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transduction mediated by 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Then, the heat&#8208;promoted LNPs morphology change triggers rapid escape of NIR&#8208;II LNPs from the endosome, allowing about 3&#8208;fold enhancement of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding mRNA translation capacity compared to the NIR&#8208;II light free group. In addition, the bioluminescence intensity induced by delivered luciferase encoding mRNA in the mouse liver region shows positive correlation with incremental radiation dose, indicating the validity of the SPEED strategy.

         <title>Sulfenate Anion Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using sulfenate anion organocatalysts, 33 trans&#8208;aziridines were synthesized with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity. This method starts with the readily accessible imines and tolerates broad substrate scope. Further functionalization of the synthesized aziridines yielded 12 novel amino&#8208;containing compounds. This work fills a gap in the synthetic and medicinal chemistry literature by providing facile access to trans&#8208;aziridines.







Abstract
Aziridines are highly valued synthetic targets in organic and medicinal chemistry. The organocatalytic synthesis of such structures with broad substrate scope and good diastereoselectivity, however, is rare. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and diastereoselective synthetic method for the synthesis of trans&#8208;aziridines from imines and benzylic or alkyl halides utilizing sulfenate anions (PhSO&#8211;) as the catalyst. Substrates bearing heterocyclic aromatic groups, alkyl, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aryl groups were shown to be compatible with this method (33&#8197;examples), giving good yields and high diastereoselectivities (trans : cis &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Further functionalization of aziridines containing cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl groups was achieved through ring&#8208;opening reactions, with a cyclobutyl&#8208;substituted norephedrine derivative obtained through a four&#8208;step synthesis. We offer a mechanistic proposal involving reversible addition of the deprotonated benzyl sulfoxide to the imine to explain the high trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoparticles with Universal Dispersibility through Crown Ether Surface Coordination for Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis and Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crown ether surface coordination (CESC) approach enables the preparation of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles with universal dispersibility, enhanced colloidal stability, recyclability, and preserved porosity. The MOF&#8208;CEC particles can be instantaneously suspended in immiscible two&#8208;phase solvents as an effective phase&#8208;transfer catalyst and can be used to prepare various uniform membranes with enhanced adsorption and separation performance.







Abstract
Dispersing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) solids in stable colloids is crucial for their availability and processibility. Herein, we report a crown ether surface coordination approach for functionalizing the surface&#8208;exposed metal sites of MOF particles with amphiphilic carboxylated crown ether (CEC). The surface&#8208;bound crown ethers significantly improve MOF solvation without compromising the accessible voids. We demonstrate that CEC&#8208;coated MOFs exhibit exceptional colloidal dispersibility and stability in 11 distinct solvents and six polymer matrices with a wide range of polarities. The MOF&#8208;CEC can be instantaneously suspended in immiscible two&#8208;phase solvents as an effective phase&#8208;transfer catalyst and can form various uniform membranes with enhanced adsorption and separation performance, which highlights the effectiveness of crown ether coating.

The surface-bound crown ethers significantly improve MOF solvation without compromising the accessible voids. We demonstrate that CE&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;-coated MOFs exhibit exceptional colloidal dispersibility and stability in 11 distinct solvents and six polymer matrices with a wide range of polarities. The MOF-CE&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; can be instantaneously suspended in immiscible two-phase solvents as an effective phase-transfer catalyst and can form various uniform membranes with enhanced adsorption and separation performance, which highlights the effectiveness of crown ether coating.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordinating the Edge Defects of Bismuth with Sulfur for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi nanosheets with the edge defect sites coordinated with S via electrochemical reconstruction of Bi19Br3S27 nanowires (BBS), and the edge&#8208;sulfur modulated Bi catalyst demonstrates enhanced formate production and suppressed hydrogen evolution. In an alkaline electrolyte, the edge&#8208;sulfur modulated Bi nanosheets exhibit high current density (&#8776;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE of HCOO&#8722; (&gt;90&#8201;%) and very low FE of H2 (&lt;5&#8201;%) over a wide potential range.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;based materials have been recognized as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, they show poor selectivity due to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we have developed an edge defect modulation strategy for Bi by coordinating the edge defects of bismuth (Bi) with sulfur, to promote ECO2RR selectivity and inhibit the competing HER. The prepared catalysts demonstrate excellent product selectivity, with a high HCOO&#8722; Faraday efficiency of &#8776;95&#8201;% and an HCOO&#8722; partial current of &#8776;250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under alkaline electrolytes. Density function theory calculations reveal that sulfur tends to bind to the Bi edge defects, reducing the coordination&#8208;unsaturated Bi sites (*H adsorption sites), and regulating the charge states of neighboring Bi sites to improve *OCHO adsorption. This work deepens our understanding of ECO2RR mechanism on bismuth&#8208;based catalysts, guiding for the design of advanced ECO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Preserving Macroporosity in Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macropore&#8208;containing Type III porous liquid (PL) is prepared through a hierarchical filler design strategy. The 4&#8197;&#197; micropores in the hollow metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), function as a perfect size&#8208;exclusion barrier to prevent PDMS from occupying the inner cavities. Thus, it can reversibly host and release up to 27&#8197;wt&#8201;% water which enables its thermal conductivity to be tuned, making it a rare example of liquid thermal switch.







Abstract
Preserving large permanent pore structures in a fluid may endow conventional liquids with emergent physical properties. However, such materials are challenging to make because of the tendency of the pores to be filled and occupied by the solvent molecules. Here, we report the design and synthesis of the first Type III porous liquid (PL) containing uniform yet stable 480&#8197;nm cavities. This was achieved by first constructing a single crystalline hollow metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, through chemical etching. The thin yet defect&#8208;free MOF shell effectively excludes the bulky poly(dimethylsiloxane) solvent molecules from entering the cavity through its 4&#8197;&#197; aperture, resulting in the preservation of both micro&#8208; and macroporosity in the PL. These enormous void spaces allow the PL to reversibly host and release up to 27&#8197;wt&#8201;% water for up to 10&#8197;cycles. The switching between the &#8220;dry&#8221; state and the &#8220;wet&#8221; state led to a large changes of the thermal conductivity of the PL from 0.140 to 0.256&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, affording a guest&#8208;responsive liquid thermal switch with a switching ratio of 1.8.

         <title>Unlocking the Interfacial Adsorption&#8208;Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Storage Limit to Enabling All&#8208;Climate, High Energy/Power Density and Durable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish storage kinetics and insufficient performance are the major challenges that restrict the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) applied for zinc ion storage, especially at the extreme temperature conditions. Herein, a multiscale interface structure&#8208;integrated modulation concept was presented, to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics&#8208;enhanced porous VSe2&#8208;x&#183;nH2O host. Theory research indicated that the co&#8208;modulation of H2O intercalation and selenium vacancy enables enhancing the interfacial zinc ion capture ability and decreasing the zinc ion diffusion barrier. Moreover, an interfacial adsorption&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was uncovered. Such cathode displayed remarkable storage performance at the wide temperature range (&#8208;40~60oC) in aqueous and solid electrolytes. In particular, it can retain a high specific capacity of 173 mAh g&#8208;1 after 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1, as well as a high energy density of 290 Wh kg&#8208;1 and a power density of 15.8 kW kg&#8208;1 at room temperature. Unexpectedly, a remarkably energy density of 465 Wh kg&#8208;1 and power density of 21.26 kW kg&#8208;1 at 60oC also can be achieved, as well as 258 Wh kg&#8208;1 and 10.8 kW kg&#8208;1 at &#8208;20oC. This work realizes a conceptual breakthrough for extending the interfacial storage limit of layered TMDs to construct all&#8208;climate high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of the Axle End Structure and Number of Through&#8208;Space Bonds on the Properties of Rotaxane Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rotaxane crosslinker (RC) is known to toughen the resulting rotaxane crosslinked polymer (RCP) via a stress dispersion effect that is attributed to the movable nature of the crosslinking structure. To evaluate this toughening mechanism in detail, a series of structure&#8208;definite RCs equipped with different axle end structures or different numbers of wheel components were synthesized, and subjected to free radical polymerization with a vinyl monomer to obtain RCPs. Analyses of the obtained RCPs revealed that the size of the axle end structure should be well&#8208;balanced to produce a strong toughening effect, and a [3]rotaxane crosslinker works more effectively than [2]rotaxane to toughen RCPs. The mobility of the crosslinking points, in terms of rotational and flipping movements, was more crucial to toughening the RCP than that of translational movement along the axle. The first observation of above crucial findings proved the utility of the systematic molecular design used in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia in Strong Acid Conditions with Fe2M&#8208;Trinuclear&#8208;Cluster Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate&#8208;containing industrial wastewater poses a serious threat to the global food security and public health safety. As compared to the traditional microbial denitrification, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction shows better sustainability with ultrahigh energy efficiency and the production of high&#8208;value ammonia (NH3). However, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater from most industrial processes, such as mining, metallurgy, and petrochemical engineering, is generally acidic, which contradicts the typical neutral/alkaline working conditions for both denitrifying bacteria and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inorganic electrocatalysts, leading to the demand for pre&#8208;neutralization and the problematic hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) competition and catalyst dissolution. Here, we report a series of FeM2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) trinuclear cluster metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that enable the highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonium under strong acidic conditions with excellent stability. In pH=1 electrolyte, the Fe2Co&#8208;MOF demonstrates the NH3 yield rate of 20653.5 &#956;g&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mg&#8722;1site with 90.55% NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency (FE), 98.5% NH3&#8208;selectivity and up to 75 hr of electrocatalytic stability. Additionally, successful nitrate reduction in high&#8208;acidic conditions directly produce the ammonium sulfate as nitrogen fertilizer, avoiding the subsequent aqueous ammonia extraction and preventing the ammonia spillage loss. This cluster&#8208;based MOF structure provide new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance nitrate reduction catalysts under environmentally&#8208;relevant wastewater conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemically Bonded Ultraconformal Layer between the Elastic Solid Electrolyte and Lithium anode for High&#8208;performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although high ionic conductivities have been achieved in most solid&#8208;state electrolytes used in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport between solid&#8208;state electrolytes and lithium anodes remains a great challenge due to the high interfacial impedances and infinite volume changes of metallic lithium. In this work, a chemical vapor&#8208;phase fluorination approach is developed to establish a lithiophilic surface on rubber&#8208;derived electrolytes, which results in the formation of a resilient, ultrathin, and mechanically integral LiF&#8208;rich layer after electrochemical cycling. The resulting ultraconformal layer chemically connects the electrolyte and lithium anode and maintains dynamic contact during operation, thus facilitating rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport across interfaces, as well as promoting uniform lithium deposition and inhibiting side reactions between electrolyte components and metallic lithium. LMBs containing the novel electrolyte have an ultralong cycling life of 2500 h and deliver a high critical current density of 1.1 mA cm&#8208;2 in lithium symmetric cells as well as showing good stability over 300 cycles in a full cell.</dc:description>

         <title>When weak is strong: a plea for low affinity binders for optical microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of low&#8208;affinity molecular interactions in protein labeling is an emerging topic in optical microscopy. Such non&#8208;covalent and low&#8208;affinity interactions can be realized with various concepts from chemistry and for different molecule classes, and lead to a constant renewal of fluorescence signals at target sites. Further benefits are a versatile use across microscopy methods, in 3D, live and many&#8208;target applications. In recent years, several classes of low&#8208;affinity labels were developed and a variety of powerful applications demonstrated. Still, this research field is underdeveloped, while the potential is huge.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled grafting expansion microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expansion microscopy (ExM) is a recently developed technique that allows for the resolution of structures below the diffraction limit by physically enlarging a hydrogel&#8208;embedded facsimile of the biological sample. The target structure is labeled and this label must be retained in a relative position true to the original, smaller state before expansion by linking it into the gel. However, gel formation and digestion lead to a significant loss in target&#8208;delivered label, resulting in weak signal. To overcome this problem, we have here developed an agent combining targeting, fluorescent labeling and gel linkage in a single small molecule. Similar approaches in the past have still suffered from significant loss of label. Here we show that this loss is due to insufficient surface grafting of fluorophores into the hydrogel and develop a solution by increasing the amount of target&#8208;bound monomers. Overall, we obtain a significant improvement in fluorescence signal retention and our new dye allows the resolution of nuclear pores as ring&#8208;like structures, similar to STED microscopy. We furthermore provide mechanistic insight into dye retention in ExM.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Imine Condensation Chemistry with [3,3] Diaza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement for One&#8208;Step Formation of Hydrolytically Stable Chiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC) has provided in recent years valuable tools to synthesize molecular architectures of increasing complexity. We also took advantage of imine DCC chemistry to prepare TPMA&#8208;based supramolecular cages for molecular recognition applications. However, the versatility of this approach has as major drawback the intrinsic hydrolytic lability of imines that hampers some applications. We present herein a synthetic strategy that combines the advantages of a thermodynamic driven formation of a supramolecular structure using imine chemistry, together with the possibility to synthetize chiral hydrolytically stable structures with a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A preliminary mechanistic analysis of this one&#8208;pot synthesis and the scope of the reaction are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrimination of the Enantiotopic Faces of Structurally Unbiased Carbenium Ions Employing a Cyclohexadiene&#8208;Based Chiral Hydride Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective reduction of simple carbenium ions with cyclohexadienes containing a hydridic C&#8211;H bond at an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom is disclosed. The net reaction is a transfer hydrogenation of alkenes (styrenes) only employing chiral cyclohexadienes as dihydrogen surrogates. The trityl cation is used to initiate a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted process, in which a delicate intermolecular capture of a carbenium&#8208;ion intermediate by the aforementioned chiral hydride source is enantioselectivity determining. Exclusively non&#8208;covalent interactions are rendering one of the transition states energetically more favored, giving the reduction products in good enantiomeric ratios. The computed reaction mechanism supports the present findings as well as previous results obtained from studies on other transfer&#8208;hydrogenation methods involving the cyclohexadiene platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Multistate Aggregation&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Properties of Enantiopure Disulfide&#8208;Mediated BisPyrene Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral bispyrene macrocycle designed for exclusive intermolecular excimer fluorescence upon aggregation was synthesized by a double hydrothiolation of a bis enol ether macrocycle followed by intramolecular oxidation of free thiols. Unusually high stereoselectivity was achieved for the thiol&#8208;ene additions under templated conditions and Et3B/O2 radical initiation. After enantiomer separation (chiral stationary phase HPLC), aqueous conditions provoked aggregation. Detailed structural evolution was afforded by ECD/CPL monitoring. Three regimes can be observed and characterized by strong modifications in chiroptical patterns under, at, or above a 70% H2O:THF threshold. In luminescence, high glum dissymmetry factors values were obtained, up to 0.022, as well as a double sign inversion of CPL signals during the aggregation, a behavior rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Langmuir layers of enantiopure disulfide macrocycles were formed at the air&#8208;water interface and transferred onto solid substrates to afford Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett films, which were then studied by AFM and UV/ECD/fluorescence/CPL.</dc:description>

         <title>An&#160;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Mediates Disulfide Migration in the Biosynthesis of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transannular disulfide functions as a key structural element imparting diverse biological activities of epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs). Although previous studies proposed mechanisms, &#945;, &#946;'&#8208;disulfide formation in ETPs is not well determined owing to the lack of identification for the hypothetical intermediate. Here, we characterize the key ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM) intermediate and prove its involvement in the carbon&#8208;sulfur migration from &#945;, &#945;'&#8208; to &#945;, &#946;'&#8208;disulfide by elucidating pretrichodermamide A biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by a FAD&#8208;dependent thioredoxin oxygenase TdaE harboring a noncanonical CXXQ motif. Biochemical investigations of recombinant TdaE and mutants demonstrated that the construction of &#945;, &#946;'&#8208;disulfide was initiated by Gln140&#8208;triggering proton abstraction for generation of the essential o&#8208;QM intermediate, accompanied by &#946;'&#8208;acetoxy elimination. Subsequent attack on &#945;, &#945;'&#8208;disulfide by Cys137 led to disulfide migration and spiro&#8208;furan formation. This study expands the biocatalytic toolbox for transannular disulfide formation and set the stage for targeted discovery of bioactive ETPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Catalyst Enables Synthesis of Colorless CO2&#8208;Polyols with Ultra&#8208;Low Molecular Weight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight (ULMW) CO2&#8208;polyols with well&#8208;defined hydroxyl end groups represent useful soft segments for the preparation of high&#8208;performance polyurethane foams. However, owing to the poor proton tolerance of catalysts towards CO2/epoxide telomerization, it remains challenging to synthesize ULMW yet colorless CO2&#8208;polyols. Herein, we propose an immobilization strategy of constructing supported catalysts by chemical anchoring of aluminum porphyrin on Merrifield resin. The resulting supported catalyst displays both extremely high proton tolerance (~8000 times than equivalent of metal center) and independence of cocatalyst, affording CO2&#8208;polyols with ULMW (580 g mol&#8208;1) and high polymer selectivity (&gt; 99%). Moreover, the ULMW CO2&#8208;polyols with various architectures (tri&#8208;, quadra&#8208;, and hexa&#8208;arm) can be obtained, suggesting the wide proton universality of supported catalysts. Notably, benefiting from the heterogeneous nature of the supported catalyst, colorless products can be facilely achieved by simple filtration. The present strategy provides a platform for the synthesis of colorless ULMW polyols derived from not only CO2/epoxides, but also lactone, anhydrides et al. or their combinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced CO Adsorption by Modulating the Electron Density Distribution of Graphite&#8208;Copper Porphyrin Sorbents with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photo&#8208;responsive adsorption has emerged as a vibrant area, but its current methodology is limited by the well&#8208;defined photochromic units and their molecular deformation driven by photo&#8208;stimuli. Herein, a methodology of nondeforming photo&#8208;responsiveness is successfully exploited. With the exploiting agent of Cu&#8208;TCPP framework assembled on the graphite and strongly interacted with it, the sorbent generates two kinds of adsorption sites, over which the electron density distribution of the graphite layer can be modulated at the c&#8208;axis direction, which can further evolve due to photo&#8208;stimulated excited states. The excited states are stable enough to meet the timescale of microscopic adsorption equilibrium. Independent of the ultra&#8208;low specific surface area of the sorbent (20 m2 g&#8208;1), the CO adsorption capability can be improved from 0.50 mmol g&#8208;1 at the ground state to 1.24 mmol g&#8208;1 (0 oC, 1 bar) with the visible light radiation, rather than the photothermal desorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycation&#8208;Regulated Electrolyte and Interfacial Electric Fields for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries but suffers from disreputable dendrite growth, grievous hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a polycation additive, polydiallyl dimethylammonium chloride (PDD), is introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, the PDD can simultaneously regulate the electric fields of electrolyte and Zn/electrolyte interface to improve Zn2+ migration behaviors and guide dominant Zn (002) deposition, which is veritably detected by Zeta potential, Kelvin probe force microscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy. Moreover, PDD also creates a positive charge&#8208;rich protective outer layer and a N&#8208;rich hybrid inner layer, which accelerates the Zn2+ desolvation during plating process and blocks the direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode. Thereby, the reversibility and long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes are substantially improved, as certified by a higher average coulombic efficiency of 99.7% for Zn//Cu cells and 22 times longer life for Zn//Zn cells compared with that of PDD&#8208;free electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl halides with ammonia offers a rapid avenue to chiral unnatural &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids. However, the construction of chiral C&#8211;N bonds between tertiary&#8208;carbon electrophiles and nitrogen nucleophiles presented a great challenge owing to steric congestion. We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl halides with sulfoximines (as ammonia surrogates) under mild conditions by employing a chiral anionic N,N,N&#8208;ligand with a long spreading side arm. An array of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives were obtained with good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the strategy has been showcased by the elaboration of the coupling products into different chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary amine building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Modulated Metal Tetrathiafulvalene Octacarboxylate Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation of the ligands and coordination environment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been an effective and relatively unexplored avenue for improving the anode performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). In this study, three MOFs are synthesized, namely, M4(o&#8208;TTFOB)(bpm)2(H2O)2 (where M is Mn, Zn, and Cd; o&#8208;H8TTFOB is ortho&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene octabenzoate; and bpm is 2,2'&#8208;bipyrimidine), based on a new ligand o&#8208;H8TTFOB with two adjacent carboxylates on one phenyl, which allows us to establish the impact of metal coordination on the performance of these MOFs as anode materials in LIBs. Mn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB and Zn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB, with two more uncoordinated oxygen atoms from o&#8208;TTFOB8&#8722;, show higher reversible specific capacities of 1249 mAh g&#8722;1 and 1288 mAh g&#8722;1 under 200 mA g&#8722;1 after full activation. In contrast, Cd&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB shows a reversible capacity of 448 mAh g&#8722;1 under the same condition due to the lack of uncoordinated oxygen atoms. Crystal structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry measurements of the half&#8208;cell configurations, and density functional theory calculations have been performed to explain the lithium storage mechanism, diffusion kinetics, and structure&#8208;function relationship. This study demonstrates the advantages of MOFs with high designability in the fabrication of LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluid Multivalent Magnetic Interface for High&#8208;Performance Isolation and Proteomic Profiling of Tumor&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluid multivalent magnetic interface was engineered in a microfluidic chip to improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition for efficient isolation of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs). With the assistance of magnetic and flow fields, this interface balanced affinity, selectivity, reversibility, and extendibility, enabling high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for protein profiling.







Abstract
Isolation and analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs) are important for clinical cancer management. Here, we develop a fluid multivalent magnetic interface (FluidmagFace) in a microfluidic chip for high&#8208;performance isolation, release, and protein profiling of T&#8208;EVs. The FluidmagFace increases affinity by 105&#8208;fold with fluidity&#8208;enhanced multivalent binding to improve isolation efficiency by 13.9&#8201;% compared with a non&#8208;fluid interface. Its anti&#8208;adsorption property and microfluidic hydrodynamic shear minimize contamination, increasing detection sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its reversibility and expandability allow high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for mass spectrometric protein analysis. With the chip, T&#8208;EVs were detected in all tested cancer samples with identification of differentially expressed proteins compared with healthy controls. The FluidmagFace opens a new avenue to isolation and release of targets for cancer diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Monitoring the Reversibility of GPCR Signaling by Combining Photochromic Ligands with Label&#8208;free Impedance Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>

Combining photochromic agonists of GPCR receptors with label&#8208;free impedance analysis of cells expressing this receptor allows monitoring and controlling dynamics and reversibility of intracellular signaling cascades in real time.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled cell surface receptors (GPCR) trigger complex intracellular signaling cascades upon agonist binding. Classic pharmacological assays provide information about binding affinities, activation or blockade at different stages of the signaling cascade, but real time dynamics and reversibility of these processes remain often disguised. We show that combining photochromic NPY receptor ligands, which can be toggled in their receptor activation ability by irradiation with light of different wavelengths, with whole cell label&#8208;free impedance assays allows observing the cell response to receptor activation and its reversibility over time. The concept demonstrated on NPY receptors may be well applicable to many other GPCRs providing a deeper insight into the time course of intracellular signaling processes.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Introduction of Bioorthogonal Handles to Nanopores by Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the genetic code expansion strategy, an azido amino acid was site&#8208;specifically incorporated into a biological nanopore and served as a &#8220;chemical clasp&#8221;, enabling bioorthogonal conjugation of DNA or proteins to generate nanopore sensors with novel sensing capacities. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific functionalization of natural amino acid&#8208;containing biological nanopores is pivotal in single molecule sensing. However, pore engineering methodologies are restricted to a limited choice and introduction of unnatural chemical components is extremely difficult. Herein we report the genetic code expansion (GCE) strategy to introduce unnatural amino acid (UAA) to an octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. GCE allows for rapid and efficient introduction of bioorthogonal reactive site (i.e., azide) to the pore rim, and conjugation of single stranded DNA or lysozyme was demonstrated. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further used for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides, demonstrating a sensing capacity that a bare MspA nanopore does not possess. GCE with bioorthogonal handles, which has never been previously applied in the preparation of nanopores, is a versatile strategy for pore engineering and may further expand the application scenarios of nanopores.

         <title>Tailoring Active Cu2O/Copper Interface Sites for N&#8208;Formylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines with CO2/H2</title>

N&#8208;formylation of aliphatic primary amines with CO2/H2 to formamide is achieved with a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal Cu&#8208;based catalyst containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites.







Abstract
Heterogeneously catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamide with CO2/H2 is highly attractive for the valorization of CO2. However, the relationship of the catalytic performance with the catalyst structure is still elusive. Herein, mixed valence catalysts containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites were constructed for this transformation. Both aliphatic primary and secondary amines with diverse structures were efficiently converted into the desired formamides with good to excellent yields. Combined ex and in situ catalyst characterization revealed that the presence of Cu2O/Cu interface sites was vital for the excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that better catalytic activity of Cu2O/Cu(111) than Cu(111) is attributed to the assistance of oxygen at the Cu2O/Cu interface (Ointer) in formation of Ointer&#8208;H moieties, which not only reduce the apparent barrier of HCOOH formation but also benefit the desorption of the desired N&#8208;formylated amine, leading to high activity and selectivity.

         <title>Stable Immobilization of Nickel Ions on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Panchromatic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking a stacked layered structure of a two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) is achieved by solvothermal conditions to enable stable coordination with Ni(II) ions via the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine moiety. This COF&#8208;Ni(II) complex exhibits an improved light absorption ability and boosts photocatalytic H2 generation (51,300 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) in a total visible spectrum, even under 700&#8208;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Post&#8208;coordination design on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an efficient strategy for elevating the photocatalytic activity of organic moiety. However, the rigid skeletons and densely layered stacking of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs cannot be flexibly adapted for specific conformations of metal complexes, thereby impairing the metal&#8208;COF cooperation. Here, we adopt a solvothermal method to immobilize nickel(II) ions into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;containing 2D COF, forming a stable coordination motif. Such the complex remarkably enhances the photocatalytic performance, giving an optimized H2 evolution rate of as high as 51&#8201;300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, 2.5&#8197;times higher than the pristine COF. The evolved hydrogen gas can also be detected upon 700&#8208;nm light irradiation, while its analog synthesized by the traditional coordination method is photo&#8208;catalytically inert. This work provides a strategy for optimizing the metal&#8208;COF coordination system and strengthening a synergy for electronic regulation in photocatalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;Mediated Regenerable FeII Active Sites for Efficient Uranium Extraction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work coupled electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox with uranium extraction and realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2. The findings also provide inspiration for other metal resource recovery applications.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;reduced iron (NRI) is a promising uranium adsorbent due to its strong reducibility and good selectivity, but it still faces the challenges of slow kinetics, limited and non&#8208;renewable active sites. In this work, we realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2 solution by coupling electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox and uranium extraction. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency of NRI after electrochemical uranium extraction (EUE) could reach 452&#8197;mg/g and 99.1&#8201;%, respectively. Combined with quasi&#8208;operando/operando characterization technologies, we clarified the mechanism of EUE and revealed that continuously regenerating FeII active sites by electroreduction could significantly enhance the property of EUE. This work here provides a new electrochemical mediated and low energy consumption uranium extraction strategy which also provides a reference for other metal resource recovery.

         <title>Mechanochemical Approach for Air&#8208;Tolerant and Extremely Fast Lithium&#8208;Based Birch Reductions in Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Birch reduction is reported for the first time. The newly developed ball&#8208;milling method does not require an inert atmosphere or other special precautions. Notably, the reaction reached completion within one minute for most of the investigated substrates. The present study thus provides a novel, operationally simple, rapid, and scalable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based Birch reduction.







Abstract
Birch reduction has been widely used in organic synthesis for over half a century as a powerful method to dearomatize arenes into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives. However, the conventional Birch reduction reaction using liquid ammonia requires laborious procedures to ensure inert conditions and low temperatures. Although several ammonia&#8208;free modifications have been reported, the development of an operationally simple, efficient, and scalable protocol remains a challenge. Herein, we report an ammonia&#8208;free lithium&#8208;based Birch reduction in air without special operating conditions using a ball&#8208;milling technique. This method is characterized by its operational simplicity and an extremely short reaction time (within 1&#8197;min), probably owing to the in situ mechanical activation of lithium metal, broad substrate scope, and no requirement for dry bulk solvents. The potential of our flash Birch reaction is also demonstrated by the efficient reduction of bioactive target molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Origin of Surface Reconstruction in Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism Based&#8208;Transition Metal Oxides: A Spontaneous Chemical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface reconstruction of Lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based metal oxides in alkaline medium was unveiled to be triggered by a spontaneous chemical reaction, instead of an electrochemical reaction. During the chemical process, the activated lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules firstly, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;). Then, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface.







Abstract
A fundamental understanding of surface reconstruction process is pivotal to developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is believed as an irreversible oxygen redox behavior, due to the much slower rate of OH&#8722; refilling than that of oxygen vacancy formation. Here, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;). Subsequently, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface. This work also suggests that the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity could accelerate the surface reconstruction process. Hence, such a finding could add a new layer for the understanding of surface reconstruction mechanism.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;N Atropisomers by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N indole&#8208;pyrrole and bisindole atropisomers was achieved by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed TDG&#8208;enabled C&#8722;H functionalization. A wide variety of the N&#8722;N atropisomers were produced in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities by C&#8722;H alkenylation, alkynylation, allylation or arylation reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric construction of N&#8722;N atropisomeric biaryls remains a formidable challenge. Studies of them lag far behind studies of the more classical carbon&#8208;carbon biaryl atropisomers, hampering meaningful development. Herein, the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation of pyrroles for the synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were produced with good yields and high enantioselectivities by alkenylation, alkynylation, allylation, or arylation reactions. Furthermore, the kinetic resolution of trisubstituted N&#8722;N heterobiaryls with more sterically demanding substituents was also achieved. Importantly, this versatile C&#8722;H functionalization strategy enables iterative functionalization of pyrroles with exquisite selectivity, expediting the formation of valuable, complex, N&#8722;N atropisomers.

         <title>Giving Gold Wings: Ultrabright and Fragmentation Free Mass Spectrometry Reporters for Barcoding, Bioconjugation Monitoring, and Data Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are highly tunable and bright mass spectrometry reporters. NHC ligands fragment less and achieve higher ion yield than conventional thiol systems, which enables bioconjugation monitoring, mass spectrometry imaging, and data storage applications.







Abstract
The widespread application of laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) highlights the need for a bright and multiplexable labeling platform. While ligand&#8208;capped Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as a promising LDI&#8208;MS contrast agent, the predominant thiol ligands suffer from low ion yields and extensive fragmentation. In this work, we develop a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand platform that enhances AuNP LDI&#8208;MS performance. NHC scaffolds are tuned to generate barcoded AuNPs which, when benchmarked against thiol&#8208;AuNPs, are bright mass tags and form unfragmented ions in high yield. To illustrate the transformative potential of NHC ligands, the mass tags were employed in three orthogonal applications: monitoring a bioconjugation reaction, performing multiplexed imaging, and storing and reading encoded information. These results demonstrate that NHC&#8208;nanoparticle systems are an ideal platform for LDI&#8208;MS and greatly broaden the scope of nanoparticle contrast agents.

In this work, we develop a N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand platform that enhances AuNP LDI-MS performance. NHC scaffolds are tuned to generate barcoded AuNPs which, when benchmarked against thiol-AuNPs, are bright mass tags and form unfragmented ions in high yield. To illustrate the transformative potential of NHC ligands, the mass tags were employed in three orthogonal applications: monitoring a bioconjugation reaction, performing multiplexed imaging, and storing and reading encoded information. These results demonstrate that NHC-nanoparticle systems are an ideal platform for LDI-MS and greatly broaden the scope of nanoparticle contrast agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Regulation to Restrain Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination for Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite LEDs with EQE Exceeding 15&#8201;%</title>

The high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with peak external quantum efficiency exceeding 15&#8201;% are attained by the use of a synergetic modulation strategy, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, via the incorporation of a bifunctional molecular additive.







Abstract
Achieving efficient blue electroluminescence (EL) remains the fundamental challenge that impedes perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) towards commercial applications. The bottleneck accounting for the inefficient blue PeLEDs is broadly attributed to the poor&#8208;emissive blue perovskite emitters based on either mixed halide engineering or reduced&#8208;dimensional strategy. Herein, we report the high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (490&#8197;nm) with the maximum EQE exceeding 15&#8201;% by incorporating a molecular modifier, namely 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Difluorophenone, for significantly suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and tuning of the low&#8208;dimensional phase distribution of quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskites, which represents a remarkable paradigm for developing the new generation of blue lighting sources.

         <title>Achieving High Single&#8208;Pass Carbon Conversion Efficiencies in Durable CO2 Electroreduction in Strong Acids via Electrode Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode&#8208;structure&#8208;engineering strategy is developed to achieve efficient, selective, and stable CO2 reduction (CO2R) with high CO2 utilization. This strategy creates a near&#8208;neutral pH and enriches K+ near catalyst surfaces during CO2R in strong acids. A stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode consistently produces formic acid with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lasting over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.







Abstract
Acidic CO2 reduction (CO2R) holds promise for the synthesis of low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint chemicals using renewable electricity. However, the corrosion of catalysts in strong acids causes severe hydrogen evolution and rapid deterioration of CO2R performance. Here, by coating catalysts with an electrically nonconductive nanoporous SiC&#8208;NafionTM layer, a near&#8208;neutral pH was stabilized on catalyst surfaces, thereby protecting the catalysts against corrosion for durable CO2R in strong acids. Electrode microstructures played a critical role in regulating ion diffusion and stabilizing electrohydrodynamic flows near catalyst surfaces. This surface&#8208;coating strategy was applied to three catalysts, SnBi, Ag, and Cu, and they exhibited high activity over extended CO2R operation in strong acids. Using a stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode, constant production of formic acid was achieved with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Copper Photoredox Catalysts for Iminyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binap&#8208;ligated copper dimer has been heterogenized on a pillar&#8208;layered MOF surface for the first time using a hydroxamic acid linker. This MOF&#8208;supported dimeric copper photocatalyst demonstrates much higher activity and recyclability than its homogeneous counterparts in intra&#8208; and intermolecular radical reactions of N&#8208;acyloxy imidates and O&#8208;acyl oximes.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light copper photocatalysis has recently emerged as a viable technology for building sustainable synthetic processes. To broaden the applications of phosphine&#8208;ligated copper(I) complexes, we describe herein an effective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported copper(I) photocatalyst for multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions. Due to site isolation, the heterogenized copper photosensitizer has a significantly higher catalytic activity than its homogeneous counterpart. Using a hydroxamic acid linker to immobilize copper species on MOF supports affords the heterogeneous catalysts with high recyclability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification sequence on MOF surfaces allows for the preparation of previously unavailable monomeric copper species. Our findings highlight the potential of using MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalytic systems to address fundamental challenges in the development of synthetic methodologies and mechanistic investigations of transition&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Surfactant Directed Synthesis of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanostructures and Precise Tuning of their Optical Activity through Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile protocol is demonstrated for the synthesis of intrinsically chiral dog&#8208;bone shaped gold nanostructures that displayed optical activity in the visible and NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The controlled assembly of the nanostructures resulted in the enhancement and precise tuning of plasmonic chirality offering potential for application in the fields of enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and spintronics.







Abstract
Fabrication and transmission of plasmonic chirality is a rapidly developing area of research. While nanoscale chirality is reasonably well explored, research on intrinsically chiral nanostructures, that has ramifications to origin of homochirality, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the synthesis of dog&#8208;bone shaped chiral gold nanostructures using a chiral cationic surfactant with excess ascorbic acid. Chiral growth is attributed to the specific binding and structure breaking ability of chiral surfactant and ascorbic acid. The controlled assembly of particles facilitated tuning and enhancement of chiral signals. Experimental observations were validated with theoretical simulations modelled in frequency domain with a surface integral&#8208;equation parameterization. Work highlighting the generation and tuning of plasmonic chirality provides new insights into the understanding of intrinsic chirality and paves way for their application in enantioselective catalysis and biosensing.

We proposed a facile approach for the direct production of H2O2, relying on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis between Polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water without any other traditional catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an indispensable basic reagent in various industries, such as textile bleach, chemical synthesis, and environmental protection. However, it is challenging to prepare H2O2 in a green, safe, simple and efficient way under ambient conditions. Here, we found that H2O2 could be synthesized using a catalytic pathway only by contact charging a two&#8208;phase interface at room temperature and normal pressure. Particularly, under the action of mechanical force, electron transfer occurs during physical contact between polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water/O2 interfaces, inducing the generation of reactive free radicals (&#8901;OH and &#8901;O2&#8722; ), and the free radicals could react to form H2O2, yielding as high as 313&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. In addition, the new reaction device could show long&#8208;term stable H2O2 production. This work provides a novel method for the efficient preparation of H2O2, which may also stimulate further explorations on contact&#8208;electrification&#8208;induced chemistry process.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for the Development of Recyclable Multifunctional Liquid Crystal Polymers via Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification and Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new synthetic strategy to combine the post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) for designing multifunctional linear liquid crystal polymers (LLCPs). A photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive LLCP is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to offer broader opportunities to structurally diversify LCPs.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) offers a versatile approach for engineering multifunctional polymers, but this advantage has not been fully exploited to fabricate multifunctional liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). Here, we design a facile synthetic approach towards multifunctional LCP by combining the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with PPM, in which ROMP helps to prepare a reactive LCP precursor with high molecular weight, and PPM provides a facilitation to introduce functional groups into the precursor. Consequently, a photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive linear LCP (LLCP) is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to diversify functions of the LCPs. Under light irradiation and humidity changes, the deformation modes of the LLCP films are converted to complex shapes (bending, twisting, and curling). The obtained dual&#8208;responsive LLCP with high molecular weight possesses excellent processability and recyclability, making it possible to construct 3D shape actuators with programmable deformation behaviors under light/humidity.

         <title>Cyclopentylmethyl Ether, a Non&#8208;Fluorinated, Weakly Solvating and Wide Temperature Solvent for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original molecular design is reported to tailor the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvents. Eliminating one O atom and increasing steric hinderance in DME leads to cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) with significantly weakened solvating power and well extended temperature range of liquid phase from &#8722;140&#8201;&#176;C and 106&#8201;&#176;C, showing a great prospect for wide temperature lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
While recent work demonstrates the advantages of weakly solvating solvents in enhancing the cyclability of LMBs, both new designs and design strategies for high performance weakly solvating solvent, especially physicochemical properties, are still lacking. Here, we propose a molecular design to tune the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvent. The resulting cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) have a weak solvating power and wide liquid&#8208;phase temperature range. By optimizing the salt concentration, the CE is further promoted to 99.4&#8201;%. Besides, the improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S battery in CPME&#8208;based electrolytes is obtained at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The Li||LFP (17.6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) battery with developed electrolyte maintains &gt;90&#8201;% of the original capacity over 400 cycles. Our design concept for solvent molecule provides a promising pathway to non&#8208;fluorinated electrolytes with weakly solvating power and wide temperature window for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric and Regiodivergent N1&#8208; and C3&#8208;Allenylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first direct catalytic asymmetric N1&#8208;functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles via an allenylic alkylation strategy. This transformation produces N&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. We also introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.







Abstract
Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic alkylation strategy for the direct functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles by employing P&#8208;chiral BIBOP&#8208;type ligands. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. Using Cs2CO3 at elevated temperatures in MeCN, N1&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen are produced in good yields with high enantioselectivity and complete N1&#8208;regioselectivity regardless of the electronic properties and substitution patterns of diverse indoles. Using K2CO3 at room temperature in CH2Cl2, chiral C3&#8208;alkylated indoles can also be obtained. Notably, we introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles that proceeded through different pathways from di&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.

         <title>Mobile Molecules: Reactivity Profiling Guides Faster Movement on a Cysteine Track</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical stepping of biopolymers within a protein nanopore suggests an enzymeless means of sequence characterization. Using a nanoreactor approach, we elucidated the reactivity profile of cysteine footholds along a protein track. Faster chemical stepping was achieved by rational mutagenesis and optimization of reaction conditions. In the future, the system has the potential for directional molecular motion at milliseconds per step.







Abstract
We previously reported a molecular hopper, which makes sub&#8208;nanometer steps by thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange along a track with cysteine footholds within a protein nanopore. Here we optimize the hopping rate (ca. 0.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the previous work) with a view towards rapid enzymeless biopolymer characterization during translocation within nanopores. We first took a single&#8208;molecule approach to obtain the reactivity profiles of individual footholds. The pKa values of cysteine thiols within a pore ranged from 9.17 to 9.85, and the pH&#8208;independent rate constants of the thiolates with a small&#8208;molecule disulfide varied by up to 20&#8208;fold. Through site&#8208;specific mutagenesis and a pH increase from 8.5 to 9.5, the overall hopping rate of a DNA cargo along a five&#8208;cysteine track was accelerated 4&#8208;fold, and the rate&#8208;limiting step 21&#8208;fold.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Induced Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Copper Nanoclusters Using DNA Nanoribbon Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of self&#8208;assembly induced enhanced electrochemiluminescence (SIEECL) using programmable DNA nanoribbon was proposed for the first time. This novel concept is confirmed in various ECL emitters, such as copper nanoclusters, gold nanoclusters and Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Accelerated electron transfer reaction and reduced energy gap contribute to the enhancement of ECL.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are attractive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters as Cu is comparatively inexpensive, nontoxic, and highly abundant. However, their ECL yield is relatively low. Herein, we report that orderly self&#8208;assembly of CuNCs using DNA nanoribbon as the template (DNR/CuNCs) conferred the CuNCs with improved ECL properties compared with individual CuNCs in both annihilation and co&#8208;reactant processes. The DNR/CuNCs resulted in a high ECL yield of 46.8&#8201;% in K2S2O8, which was &#8776;68 times higher than that of individual CuNCs. This strategy was successfully extended to other ECL emitters, such as gold nanoclusters and the Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Furthermore, as an application of DNR/CuNCs, a DNR/CuNC&#8208;based ECL biosensor with higher sensitivity was constructed for dopamine determination (two orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported), showing that DNR/CuNCs have a potential for application in ECL bioanalysis as a new type of superior luminophore candidate.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Manipulated p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Synergy Enables Efficient Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; synergy is realized by combining phosphine and carbazole groups in three hybrid molecules (xCzTPP). The harmonized p&#8208;electronic feature and steric effect of the phosphine group result in RTP efficiency and lifetime of para&#8208;substituted pCzTPP up to 13.8&#8201;% and 645&#8197;ms, respectively, owing to its sequential and complementary triplet p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; components in intersystem crossing and triplet energy&#8208;transfer processes.







Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) attracts extensive attentions, but still faces the challenge of achieving both high RTP efficiencies (&#951;RTP) and long lifetimes (&#964;RTP), due to the intrinsic contradiction between triplet radiation and stabilization. In this work, we developed three carbazole&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrids named xCzTPP, in which phosphine groups provide nonbonding electrons and steric hindrance to modulate intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. With the rational orientations and spatial positions of functional groups, para&#8208;substituted pCzTPP achieves high &#951;RTP over 10&#8201;% and more than twofold increased &#964;RTP (&gt;600&#8197;ms), compared to ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208; isomers. Theoretical simulation and photophysical investigation indicate that the strongest intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic interplays of pCzTPP harmonize high transition probability of 3p&#960; state and triplet stability of 3&#960;&#960; state, reflecting the p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; synergy in RTP process.

         <title>A Universal Synthesis Strategy for Tunable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanohybrids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we show a versatile, general synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells (ZIF&#8208;zni, ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;67, FJU&#8208;30, MIL&#8208;88(Fe), HKUST&#8208;1, and MOF&#8208;74(Co)) and six cores (Ag, Au, NaYF4, &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, Fe2O3 and Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2) that are fine&#8208;tuned such that from single to hundreds of cores are incorporated in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) enjoy a vastly expanded application potential in catalysis, filtration, and sensing. The selection of particular modified core&#8208;NPs has yielded partial successes in overcoming lattice mismatch. However, restrictions on the choice of NPs not only limit the diversity, but also affect the properties of the hybrid materials. Here, we show a versatile synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells and six NP&#8208;cores that are fine&#8208;tuned to incorporate from single to hundreds of cores in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites. This method does not require the presence of any specific surface structures or functionalities on the pre&#8208;formed cores. Our key point is to regulate the diffusion rate of alkaline vapors that deprotonate organic linkers and trigger the controlled MOF&#8208;growth and encapsulation of NPs. This strategy is expected to pave the way for the exploration of more sophisticated MOF&#8208;nanohybrids.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement from Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diads Decorated with Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as an Electrochemical Protector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of electrochemical protectors was demonstrated with a classical Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, which was mounted on donor&#8208;acceptor emitters to greatly stabilize electrogenerated radicals and enhance the Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Electrochemical doping in segregated emitter&#8208;B(C6F5)3 co&#8208;assemblies afforded a crystalline film showing ECL through singlet exciton delocalization derived from columnar &#960;&#8208;stacks.







Abstract
This study reports an effective peripheral decoration of organic donor&#8208;acceptor diads with B(C6F5)3 for stabilizing electrogenerated radical ions. By employing a common p&#8208;type organic semiconductor benzothienobenzothiophene (BTBT) as the donor, tetracoordinate boron complexes showed improved solution electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity, reaching a 156&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the parent diad. The unprecedented Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement is attributed to the multiple roles of B(C6F5)3: 1)&#8197;redistributing frontier orbitals, 2)&#8197;facilitating electrochemical excitation, and 3)&#8197;restricting molecular motions. Furthermore, B(C6F5)3 converted the molecular arrangement of BTBT from conventional 2D herringbones into 1D &#960;&#8208;stacks. This robust, highly ordered columnar nanostructure allowed red&#8208;shifting of the crystalline film ECL with electrochemical doping through the electronic coupling pathways of BTBT. Our approach will facilitate the development of elaborate metal&#8208;free ECL systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Orderly Assembly of Ir&#8208;atomic Chains to Integrate a Dynamic Reaction Pathway for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we propose an intriguing light&#8208;driven orderly assembly strategy for implanting Ir&#8208;chains and clusters onto catalyst surfaces with different order degrees. Interestingly, the dynamic orbital interaction between orderly Ir&#8208;atomic chains and clusters can be regulated by balancing the dissolution and redisposition rate. As a result, the activation energy in acidic OER can be effectively reduced by integrating a dynamic reaction pathway. 







Abstract
This work suggests an intriguing light&#8208;driven atomic assembly proposal to orderly configure the distribution of reactive sites to optimize the spin&#8208;entropy&#8208;related orbital interaction and charge transfer from electrocatalysts to intermediates. Herein, the introduced fluorine (F) atoms acting as photo&#8208;corrosion centres in MnO1.9F0.1 effectively soften the bonding interaction of Mn&#8722;O bonds in the IrCl3 solution. Therefore, partial Mn atoms can be successively replaced to form orderly atomic&#8208;hybridized catalysts with a spin&#8208;related low entropy due to the coexistence of Ir&#8208;atomic chains and clusters. The time&#8208;related elemental analysis demonstrates that the dynamic dissolution/redeposition of Ir clusters in acidic oxygen evolution leads to a reintegration of the reaction pathway to seek the switchable rate&#8208;limiting step with a lower activation energy.

         <title>Precise Epitope Organization with Self&#8208;adjuvant Framework Nucleic Acid for Efficient COVID&#8208;19 Peptide Vaccine Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs)&#8208;based peptide vaccines with different structures and sizes were constructed to understand the effect of peptide spacing and carrier rigidity on B&#8197;cell activation, and reveal the significance of precise peptide organization. Epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were assembled on the preferred FNA to construct a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine prototype which effectively triggered humoral immune responses in mice.







Abstract
Peptide vaccines have advantages in easy fabrication and high safety, but their effectiveness is hampered by the poor immunogenicity of the epitopes themselves. Herein, we constructed a series of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) with regulated rigidity and size to precisely organize epitopes in order to reveal the influence of epitope spacing and carrier rigidity on the efficiency of peptide vaccines. We found that assembling epitopes on rigid tetrahedral FNAs (tFNAs) with the appropriate size could efficiently enhance their immunogenicity. Further, by integrating epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on preferred tFNAs, we constructed a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine which could induce high titers of IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and increase the ratio of memory B and T cells in mice. Considering the good biocompatibility of tFNAs, our research provides a new idea for developing efficient peptide vaccines against viruses and possibly other diseases.

         <title>Practical Access to meta&#8208;Substituted Anilines by Amination of Quinone Imine Ketals Derived from Anisidines: Efficient Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Psychotic Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;amination of arylamines with aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic amines is reported based on a one&#8208;pot procedure. The strategy is based on direct C&#8722;N bond formation for the practical synthesis of meta&#8208;substituted anilines, thus reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity. A concise and efficient synthesis of anti&#8208;psychotics and in particular of anti&#8208;schizophrenic drugs is shown.







Abstract
Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C&#8722;H activation provides efficient retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds. Described herein is the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction that selectively performs meta&#8208;amination of anisidines with aliphatic&#8208;, heterocyclic&#8208; and aromatic amines in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In addition to dramatically simplifying the synthesis of meta&#8208;substituted anilines, our approach has the advantage of the scalability and remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds and natural products. The control experiments and detailed computational analysis provide insight into the reaction mechanism and the origin of meta&#8208;selectivity. The protocol extended to the synthesis of challenging tri&#8208;aminated arenes and successfully applied for the efficient synthesis of 5&#8208;HT6 receptor antagonists, the anti&#8208;psychotic drugs viz.. SB&#8208;214111, SB&#8208;258510, and specifically, anti&#8208;schizophrenic drug SB&#8208;271046.

         <title>Vinyl Halide&#8208;Modified Unsaturated Cyclitols are Mechanism&#8208;Based Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclohexene&#8208;based carbohydrate mimics have been shown to react with glycoside hydrolases via positively charged, allylic cation&#8208;like transition states. By incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing halogens at the vinyl position of the allyl ethers of these sugar mimics, potent inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases were prepared. This approach is orthogonal to existing strategies and offers a new tool to probe glycosidase active sites.







Abstract
Suitably configured allyl ethers of unsaturated cyclitols act as substrates of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases, reacting via allylic cation transition states. Incorporation of halogens at the vinylic position of these carbasugars, along with an activated leaving group, generates potent inactivators of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases. Enzymatic turnover of these halogenated cyclitols (F, Cl, Br) displayed a counter&#8208;intuitive trend wherein the most electronegative substituents yielded the most labile pseudo&#8208;glycosidic linkages. Structures of complexes with the Sulfolobus &#946;&#8208;glucosidase revealed similar enzyme&#8208;ligand interactions to those seen in complexes with a 2&#8208;fluorosugar inhibitor, the lone exception being displacement of tyrosine 322 from the active site by the halogen. Mutation of Y322 to Y322F largely abolished glycosidase activity, consistent with lost interactions at O5, but minimally affected (7&#8208;fold) rates of carbasugar hydrolysis, yielding a more selective enzyme for unsaturated cyclitol ether hydrolysis.

         <title>An Electron&#8208;Deficient CpE Iridium(III) Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application to Ether&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complex was developed ([CpEIrI2]2). This complex effectively catalyzed weakly coordinating ether&#8208;directed C&#8722;H amidation reactions under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicated that the high catalytic activity of the [CpEIrI2]2 complex is attributed to its highly electron&#8208;deficient nature.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of an iridium(III) catalyst with an electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadienyl ligand ([CpEIrI2]2) are reported. The [CpEIrI2]2 catalyst was synthesized by complexation of a precursor of the CpE ligand with [Ir(cod)OAc]2, followed by oxidation, desilylation, and removal of the COD ligand. The electron&#8208;deficient [CpEIrI2]2 catalyst enabled C&#8722;H amidation reactions assisted by a weakly coordinating ether directing group. Experimental mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggested that the high catalytic performance of [CpEIrI2]2 is due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature, which accelerates both C&#8722;H activation and IrV&#8208;nitrenoid formation.

Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicated that the high catalytic activity of the [Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;IrI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex is attributed to its highly electron-deficient nature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of an iridium(III) catalyst with an electron-deficient cyclopentadienyl ligand ([Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;IrI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are reported. The [Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;IrI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst was synthesized by complexation of a precursor of the Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; ligand with [Ir(cod)OAc]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by oxidation, desilylation, and removal of the COD ligand. The electron-deficient [Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;IrI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst enabled C&#8722;H amidation reactions assisted by a weakly coordinating ether directing group. Experimental mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggested that the high catalytic performance of [Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;IrI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is due to its electron-deficient nature, which accelerates both C&#8722;H activation and Ir&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;-nitrenoid formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interaction between Divalent Copper Fluoride and Carboxamide Group Enabling Stereoretentive Fluorination of Tertiary Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination reaction allowed to achieve the synthesis of molecules bearing F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Based on the use of enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;halocarboxamides and inexpensive CsF, the reaction could be controlled by efficient divalent&#8208;Cu/carboxamide interactions. This new methodology enables to generate the tert&#8208;alkyl fluorides in a stereoretentive manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination involving CsF and &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as tertiary alkyl sources that, unlike traditional stereospecific routes involving stereoinversive SN2 reactions, proceeds with retention of stereochemistry. The developed stereospecific Cu&#8208;catalyzed reaction is among the most efficient methods for synthesizing fluorinated molecules that possess highly congested stereogenic carbon centers. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combined reactivity of CuF2 and Cs salt is essential for completing the catalytic cycle. Our catalytic system underwent fluorination exclusively with tertiary alkyl bromides and did not react with primary alkyl bromides, indicating that this stereospecific fluorination methodology is suitable for synthesizing fluorinated building blocks possessing stereo&#8208;defined F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center.

         <title>Heptagon&#8208;Containing Nanographene Embedded into [10]Cycloparaphenylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A saddle&#8208;shaped heptagon&#8208;containing nanographene and a [10]cycloparaphenylene are merged into a single nanohoop. The intrinsic curvature of the nanographene diminishes the strain energy of the hoop, increases the binding constant and enables a fast electron transfer toward fullerenes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a novel type of nanohoop, consisting of a cycloparaphenylene derivative incorporating a curved heptagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) unit. We demonstrate that this new macrocycle behaves as a supramolecular receptor of curved &#960;&#8208;systems such as fullerenes C60 and C70, with remarkably large binding constants (ca. 107&#8197;M&#8722;1), as estimated by fluorescence measurements. Nanosecond and femtosecond spectroscopic analysis show that these host&#8208;guest complexes are capable of quasi&#8208;instantaneous charge separation upon photoexcitation, due to the ultrafast charge transfer from the macrocycle to the complexed fullerene. These results demonstrate saddle&#8208;shaped PAHs with dibenzocycloheptatrienone motifs as structural components for new macrocycles displaying molecular receptor abilities and versatile photochemical responses with promising electron&#8208;donor properties in host&#8208;guest complexes.

         <title>Approaching Theoretical Performances of Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation by Cobalt&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts were studied through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic methods. When cathodically biased, a reconstruction in the symmetry of Co&#8722;Nx active sites is discovered, which leads to a shift in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction selectivity from producing water to hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been intensively studied for environmentally benign applications. However, insufficient understanding of ORR 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway mechanism at the atomic level inhibits rational design of catalysts with both high activity and selectivity, causing concerns including catalyst degradation due to Fenton reaction or poor efficiency of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Herein we show that the generally accepted ORR electrocatalyst design based on a Sabatier volcano plot argument optimises activity but is unable to account for the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway selectivity. Through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic studies on a series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids, a construction&#8208;driven approach based on an extended &#8220;dynamic active site saturation&#8221; model that aims to create the maximum number of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR sites by directing the secondary ORR electron transfer towards the 2&#8201;e&#8722; intermediate is proven to be attainable by manipulating O2 hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in a Supported Copper/ZnO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of formation of alcohol&#8208;induced strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) on the surface of a Cu/ZnO catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in metal catalysts is a promising strategy to improve their catalytic performance. In this article, we systematically investigated the influences of different alcohol/water mixtures on the evolution of the interfacial structure of Cu/ZnO catalysts in the reduction stage. A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of alcohol induced SMSI. It was found that when methanol/water is added to H2 during the reduction pretreatment, more oxygen vacancies are formed on the ZnO support, which facilitates the dissociation of H2O and the hydroxylation of ZnO species. Such promotion eventually favors the SMSI between Cu and ZnO and increases the catalytic activity for the methanol steam reforming reaction. In contrast, the addition of ethanol/water and 1&#8208;propanol/water during reduction leads to a physical blockage of the catalyst by alcohol molecules, poisoning the active Cu sites and limiting the migration of ZnO species.

         <dc:description>
Three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzoxazinones with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides were developed under transition metal catalysis. Pharmaceutically significant bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, benzimidazolines and dibenzodiazepines, were produced with high efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, detailed mechanism studies were carried out to explain the proposed mechanism and reaction selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs) are a unique and efficient handle for azaheterocycle synthesis. Despite great achievements, the potential of these reactive intermediates has not yet been fully exploited, especially the new reaction modes. Herein, we disclosed an unprecedented dearomatization process of metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs, affording transient dearomatized spiroaziridine intermediates. Based on this serendipity, we accomplished three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzimidazolines with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides, enabling the divergent synthesis of bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles with high efficiency and flexibility. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to explain the proposed mechanisms and observed selectivity. Further cellular evaluation of the dibenzodiazepine products identified a hit compound for new antitumor drugs.

         <title>Hemin as a General Static Dark Quencher for Constructing Heme Oxygenase&#8208;1 Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemin was identified as a broad&#8208;spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) and highly efficient (quenching efficiency &gt;97&#8201;%) dark quencher for designing &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probes. Based on this initial discovery, the first live cell&#8208;applicable fluorescent probe of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) was disclosed and a convenient fluoroassay was developed for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in biological samples.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule probes suitable for live&#8208;cell applications remains challenging yet highly desirable. We report the first fluorescent probe, RBH, for imaging the heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) activity in live cells after discovering hemin as a universal dark quencher. Hemin works via a static quenching mechanism and shows high quenching efficiency (&gt;97&#8201;%) with fluorophores across a broad spectrum (&#955;ex=400&#8211;700&#8197;nm). The favorable properties of RBH (e.g. long excitation/emission wavelengths, fast response rate and high magnitude of signal increase) enable its use for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in complex biological samples. As HO&#8208;1 is involved in regulating antioxidant defence, iron homeostasis and gasotransmitter carbon monoxide production, we expect RBH to be a powerful tool for dissecting its functions. Also, the discovery of hemin as a general static dark quencher provides a straightforward strategy for constructing novel fluorescent probes for diverse biological species.

         <title>A Hydrogel Microneedle Assay Combined with Nucleic Acid Probes for On&#8208;Site Detection of Small Molecules and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed a versatile microneedle (MN) biosensor applicable for detecting various clinical biomarkers, present in interstitial fluid, on&#8208;site and near a patient's point of care. Our MN&#8208;based biosensor has displayed accurate and reliable results at in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo settings when compared to benchmark assays. The developed MN paves the way for better health management and timely treatment.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of clinical biomarkers is critical to health monitoring and timely treatment, yet biosensing assays capable of detecting biomarkers without the need for costly external equipment and reagents are limited. Blood&#8208;based assays are, specifically, challenging as blood collection is invasive and follow&#8208;upprocessing is required. Here, we report a versatile assay that employs hydrogel microneedles (HMNs) to extract interstitial fluid (ISF), in a minimally invasive manner integrated with graphene oxide&#8208;nucleic acid (GO.NA)&#8208;based fluorescence biosensor to sense the biomarkers of interest in situ. The HMN&#8208;GO.NA assay is supplemented with a portable detector, enabling a complete POCT procedure. Our system could successfully measure four clinically important biomarkers (glucose, uric acid (UA), insulin, and serotonin) ex vivo, in addition, to accurately detecting glucose and UA in vivo.

         <title>Detachable Porous Organic Polymers Responsive to Light and Heat</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material was prepared based on the detachment mechanism. The detachable porous polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, was fabriated by the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer with 365&#8197;nm UV light and it can detach into the monomer upon irradiation with 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. The detachment results in a large difference in porosity and adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials have captured much attention due to the on&#8208;demand tunable properties. Most reported stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials are based on molecule isomerism or host&#8208;guest interaction, and it is highly desired to develop new types based on different responsive mechanism. Herein, inspired by natural cells which have the ability to fuse and divide induced by external stimulation, we report a new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material based on detachment mechanism. A detachable porous organic polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, is fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer (AnMon) when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light. DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1 can detach into the monomer AnMon when irradiated with 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. Such polymerization/detachment is reversible. The detachment results in a big difference in porosity and adsorption capacity, making the present detachable porous polymer highly promising in adsorptive separation and drug delivery.

         <title>Revealing the Interfacial Chemistry of Fluoride Alkyl Magnesium Salts in Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>

Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts reconstructing the solvation structure of Mg2+ not only improve the high voltage tolerance of the electrolyte, but also facilitate the in situ generation of a robust solid electrolyte interface enabling a steady Mg metal anode.







Abstract
Exploring promising electrolyte&#8208;system with high reversible Mg plating/stripping and excellent stability is essential for rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs). Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts (Mg(ORF)2) not only possess high solubility in ether solvents but also compatible with Mg metal anode, thus holding a vast application prospect. Herein, a series of diverse Mg(ORF)2 were synthesized, among them, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol magnesium (Mg(PFTB)2)/AlCl3/MgCl2 based electrolyte demonstrates highest oxidation stability, and promotes the in situ formation of robust solid electrolyte interface. Consequently, the fabricated symmetric cell sustains a long&#8208;term cycling over 2000&#8197;h, and the asymmetric cell exhibits a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% over 3000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the Mg||Mo6S8 full cell maintains a stable cycling over 500&#8197;cycles. This work presents guidance for understanding structure&#8211;property relationships and electrolyte applications of fluoride alkyl magnesium salts.

         <title>Nickel(II) Nitrate Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Single&#8208;Junction Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with a Record 19.02&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

A facile strategy was developed to improve the film quality of a solution processed nickel(II) nitrate hole transporting layer, which realized a record efficiency of 19.02&#8201;% for the binary blend bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.







Abstract
A facile strategy was developed here to improve the film quality of nickel&#8208;based hole transporting layer (HTL) for efficient organic solar cell (OSC) applications. To prevent the agglomeration of Ni(NO3)2 during film deposition, acetylacetonate was added into the precursor solution, which led to the formation of an amorphous and glass&#8208;like state. After thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the film&#8208;forming ability could be further improved. The additional UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatment continuously improved the film quality and increased the work function and conductivity of such HTL. The resulting TA &amp; UVO modified Ni(NO3)2 &amp; Hacac HTL produced highly efficient organic solar cells with exciting power conversion efficiencies of 18.42&#8201;% and 19.02&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Th devices, respectively, much higher than the control PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS devices.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Pure Isotropic Proton Solid State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;learning on three&#8208;dimensional variable spinning rate datasets provides a powerful method to obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H two&#8208;dimensional NMR spectra in rigid organic solids by removing broadening due to dipolar interactions.







Abstract
One key bottleneck of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is that 1H NMR spectra of organic solids are often very broad due to the presence of a strong network of dipolar couplings. We have recently suggested a new approach to tackle this problem. More specifically, we parametrically mapped errors leading to residual dipolar broadening into a second dimension and removed them in a correlation experiment. In this way pure isotropic proton (PIP) spectra were obtained that contain only isotropic shifts and provide the highest 1H NMR resolution available today in rigid solids. Here, using a deep&#8208;learning method, we extend the PIP approach to a second dimension, and for samples of L&#8208;tyrosine hydrochloride and ampicillin we obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H double&#8208;quantum/single&#8208;quantum dipolar correlation and spin&#8208;diffusion spectra with significantly higher resolution than the corresponding spectra at 100&#8197;kHz MAS, allowing the identification of previously overlapped isotropic correlation peaks.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Induced Planar Chirality of Soft&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Platinum(II) Complexes: 100&#8201;% Phosphorescence Quantum Yields, Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting, and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic (R)/(S) and enantiopure (D,R,D)/(L,S,L) binuclear PtII complexes with metal&#8208;induced planar chirality were designed and prepared by using soft&#8208;bridged achiral and chiral ligands, respectively. Their phosphorescence quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% can be achieved by shortening intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distance for highly efficient solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized OLEDs.







Abstract
PtII complexes have attracted a great deal of interest due to their rich phosphorescent properties. However, these square&#8208;planar PtII complexes are far more likely to encounter the problems of lack of metal&#8208;induced chirality and emission &#8220;aggregation&#8208;caused quenching&#8221;. Herein, soft&#8208;bridged binuclear PtII complexes bearing metal&#8208;induced planar chirality were synthesized and characterized. These soft bridging ligands with smaller conjugated system would help to not only improve solubility for synthesis and enantioseparation but also introduce point chirality from amino acid for highly efficient diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, the intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distances could be well regulated by soft bridging ligands, and consequently the phosphorescence quantum yield up to 100&#8201;% could be achieved by shortening intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distance for first time. These complexes can be used as emitters in highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Manipulating Local Lattice Distortion for Spectrally Stable and Efficient Mixed&#8208;halide Blue Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new local lattice distortion (LLD) manipulation strategy was demonstrated to suppress the halide migration in mixed&#8208;halide perovskite. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that the LLD manipulation effectively suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLED with champion EQE of 14.2&#8201;% at 475&#8197;nm and impressive T50 of 72&#8197;min has been achieved, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites are considered the most straightforward candidate to realize blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, they suffer severe halide migration, leading to spectral instability, which is particularly exaggerated in high chloride alloying perovskites. Here, we demonstrate energy barrier of halide migration can be tuned by manipulating the degree of local lattice distortion (LLD). Enlarging the LLD degree to a suitable level can increase the halide migration energy barrier. We herein report an &#8220;A&#8208;site&#8221; cation engineering to tune the LLD degree to an optimal level. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that LLD manipulation suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Conclusively, mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLEDs with a champion EQE of 14.2&#8201;% at 475&#8197;nm have been achieved. Moreover, the devices exhibit excellent operational spectral stability (T50 of 72&#8197;min), representing one of the most efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs reported yet.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Supramolecular Polymers Based on Selectively Recognized Aromatic Cation&#8208;&#960; and Donor&#8208;Acceptor Motifs for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first demonstration of an aromatics&#8208;selective recognition strategy for cation&#8208;&#960; and donor&#8208;acceptor motifs that avoid their mutual interference, thus enabling the construction of two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers (2DSPs), which exhibit boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic polymers have recently received considerable interest, especially those whose architectures are held together via supramolecular engineering. However, current approaches toward supramolecular 2D structures usually suffer from mutual interference of noncovalent interactions and lack of intrinsic functions.

&lt;p&gt;This is the first demonstration of an aromatics-selective recognition strategy for cation-&#960; and donor-acceptor motifs that avoid their mutual interference, thus enabling the construction of two-dimensional supramolecular polymers (2DSPs), which exhibit boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) organic polymers have recently received considerable interest, especially those whose architectures are held together via supramolecular engineering. However, current approaches toward supramolecular 2D structures usually suffer from mutual interference of noncovalent interactions and lack of intrinsic functions. Herein, we report well-regulated 2D supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) through an aromatics-selective recognition strategy of cation-&#960; and donor-acceptor (D-A) motifs, which are derived from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric cationic monomers and electron-withdrawing molecules. By subtly designing the strength and direction of noncovalent driving forces, the mutual interference between cation-&#960; and D-A interactions is effectively avoided, enabling the construction of 2DSPs in aqueous solution. On this basis, the resultant 2DSPs possess boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity at a rate of 600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is mainly ascribed to the specific stacking mode of cation-&#960;/D-A motifs and the ordered 2D structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane with a High Donor Additive for Efficient Anode Reversibility in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries is improved by regulating the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Pyridine (Py) as high donor number organic electrolyte additive (only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition) is used to efficiently regulate the solvation sheath structure, which results in depressed H2O activity at the IHP interface. The thus&#8208;formed IHP interface enables a superior stable Zn anode with high reversibility and utilization rate.







Abstract
The performance of aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) is highly dependent on inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Notorious parasitic reactions containing hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and Zn dendrites both originate from abundant free H2O and random Zn deposition inside active IHP. Here, we report a universal high donor number (DN) additive pyridine (Py) with only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition (Py&#8208;to&#8208;H2O volume ratio), for regulating molecule distribution inside IHP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verify that incorporated Py additive could tailor Zn2+ solvation sheath and exclude H2O molecules from IHP effectively, which is in favor of preventing H2O decomposition. Consequently, even at extreme conditions such as high depth of discharge (DOD) of 80&#8201;%, the symmetric cell based on Py additive can sustain approximately 500&#8197;h long&#8208;term stability. This efficient strategy with high DN additives furnishes a promising direction for designing novel electrolytes and promoting the practical application of AZIBs, despite inevitably introducing trace organic additives.

         <title>Loading of Amino Acids onto RNA in a Putative RNA&#8208;Peptide World</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The loading of RNAs with amino acids constitutes the first step toward RNA&#8208;based peptide synthesis in a putative prebiotic RNA&#8208;peptide world. The efficient loading of RNA strands incorporating N&#8208;methylcarbamoyl nucleotides with a series of amino acids is reported. The loaded RNA strands also underwent RNA&#8208;based amino acid transfer reactions.







Abstract
RNA is a molecule that can both store genetic information and perform catalytic reactions. This observed dualism places RNA into the limelight of concepts about the origin of life. The RNA world concept argues that life started from self&#8208;replicating RNA molecules, which evolved toward increasingly complex structures. Recently, we demonstrated that RNA, with the help of conserved non&#8208;canonical nucleosides, which are also putative relics of an early RNA world, had the ability to grow peptides covalently connected to RNA nucleobases, creating RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras. It is conceivable that such molecules, which combined the information&#8208;coding properties of RNA with the catalytic potential of amino acid side chains, were once the structures from which life emerged. Herein, we report prebiotic chemistry that enabled the loading of both nucleosides and RNAs with amino acids as the first step toward RNA&#8208;based peptide synthesis in a putative RNA&#8208;peptide world.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Mavacuran Alkaloids through Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;Addition of an Organolithium Reagent
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor enabled the synthesis of six mavacuran alkaloids with a highly strained pentacyclic cagelike framework. The chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the reaction was rationalized by DFT calculations. Dihydroxylation and pinacol rearrangement of the indole nucleus completed the first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine.







Abstract
We report a synthetic endeavor towards the highly strained pentacyclic caged framework of the mavacuran alkaloids which culminated with the concise total synthesis of C&#8208;fluorocurine, C&#8208;profluorocurine, C&#8208;mavacurine, normavacurine, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;pleiocarpamine and taberdivarine H. We designed a strategy involving late&#8208;stage construction of the D ring by Michael addition of a vinylic nucleophile to a 2&#8208;indolyl acrylate moiety. While the intramolecular Michael addition did not succeed, we were able to perform a diastereoselective unusual intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor with the assistance of the piperidine nitrogen atom through the formation of a complex as suggested by DFT computations. Final cyclization was achieved by nucleophilic substitution to form an ammonium intermediate. The first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine were finalized by the dihydroxylation of C&#8208;mavacurine and a pinacol rearrangement, respectively.

         <title>A Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Unique Aromatic Pore Surfaces for High Performance C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces, suitable pore spaces and pore volumes, Ni&#8208;MOF 2 displays high separation performance for C2H6/C2H4 separation and produces polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 with high productivity (12&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1) by a single separation process.







Abstract
Developing adsorptive separation processes based on C2H6&#8208;selective sorbents to replace energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation is a promising alternative for C2H4 purification from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures, which however remains challenging. During our studies on two isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOF 1 and Ni&#8208;MOF 2), we found that Ni&#8208;MOF 2 exhibited significantly higher performance for C2H6/C2H4 separation than Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, as clearly established by gas sorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments. Density&#8208;Functional Theory (DFT) studies showed that the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces within Ni&#8208;MOF 2 induce more and stronger C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; with C2H6 over C2H4 while the suitable pore spaces enforce its high C2H6 uptake capacity, featuring Ni&#8208;MOF 2 as one of the best porous materials for this very important gas separation. It generates 12&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 product from equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at ambient conditions.

Density-Functional Theory (DFT) studies showed that the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces within &lt;b&gt;Ni-MOF 2&lt;/b&gt; induce more and stronger C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; while the suitable pore spaces enforce its high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity, featuring &lt;b&gt;Ni-MOF 2&lt;/b&gt; as one of the best porous materials for this very important gas separation. It generates 12&#8197;L&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; product from equimolar C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures at ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene Mediates Charge Transfer between Lead Chromate and a Cobalt Cubane Cocatalyst for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially oxidized graphene (pGO) operates as a charge&#8208;transfer mediator between the water oxidation cocatalyst (Co4O4) and the hole&#8208;accumulating {&#8722;101} facets of PbCrO4. Unimpeded transfer of photogenerated holes from PbCrO4 to Co4O4 via the pGO mediator is demonstrated. The resulting Co4O4/pGO/PbCrO4 photocatalyst oxidizes water with an apparent quantum efficiency exceeding 10&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The interfacial barrier of charge transfer from semiconductors to cocatalysts means that the photogenerated charges cannot be fully utilized, especially for the challenging water oxidation reaction. Using cobalt cubane molecules (Co4O4) as water oxidation cocatalysts, we rationally assembled partially oxidized graphene (pGO), acting as a charge&#8208;transfer mediator, on the hole&#8208;accumulating {&#8722;101} facets of lead chromate (PbCrO4) crystal. The assembled pGO enables preferable immobilization of Co4O4 molecules on the {&#8722;101} facets of the PbCrO4 crystal, which is favorable for the photogenerated holes transferring from PbCrO4 to Co4O4 molecules. The surface charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of PbCrO4 was boosted by selective assembly of pGO between PbCrO4 and Co4O4 molecules. An apparent quantum efficiency for photocatalytic water oxidation on the Co4O4/pGO/PbCrO4 photocatalyst exceeded 10&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm. This strategy of rationally assembling charge&#8208;transfer mediator provides a feasible method for acceleration of charge transfer and utilization in semiconductor photocatalysis.

         <title>Facile Access to Cyclopropylboronates via Stereospecific Deborylative Cyclization: A Leaving Group&#8208;Assisted Activation of Geminal Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy led to the efficient synthesis of racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates. The cyclization of geminal&#8208;bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective and stereospecific, tolerating various functional groups and heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicated that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.







Abstract
Herein we reported a transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy, based on which two routes have been developed, generating racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates. The cyclization of geminal&#8208;bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective, tolerating a few functional groups and applicable to heterocycles. When optically active epoxides were used as the starting materials, enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates could be efficiently prepared with &gt;99&#8201;% stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies showed that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position played a crucial role and significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.

         <title>Atroposelective Three&#8208;Component Coupling of Cyclic Diaryliodoniums and Sodium Cyanate Enabled by the Dual&#8208;Role of Phenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atroposelective copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium, cyanate and phenols is used to synthesize axially chiral carbamates. The success of this coupling is attributed to the key dual role of phenols, which are capable of activating the copper catalyst and trapping the isocyanate intermediate.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums, sodium cyanate (NaOCN) and phenols is reported. The reaction chemoselectively affords axially chiral carbamates by sequential coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium and NaOCN, followed by phenol. Mechanistic investigations revealed that phenol is not only a reagent to trap highly active intermediate isocyanates, but it also activates the copper catalyst as a standby ligand. The carbamates were readily transformed into highly functionalized urea derivatives within a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes with Joined Nonhexagons via a Ring Expansion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, novel nanographenes bearing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs were synthesized through a facile ring expansion strategy. Modifications of heptagon spacers have endowed N&#8208;doped nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties. This ring expansion method was further explored to synthesize diverse N&#8208;doped nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs, demonstrating the high efficiency of the proposed method.







Abstract
Synthetic methodology is considered a holy grail in both organic chemistry and materials science. Over the past few decades, researchers have explored graphene&#8208;type molecules (or nanographenes) through classic Scholl oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. Despite the successes achieved with various nanographenes, the development of new methods to synthesize these highly desired molecules lags behind. Herein, we developed a facile and effective method to produce a series of nanographenes bearing nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in acceptable yields. Modification of the heptagonal ring endowed the resultant nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties; for instance, M9 exhibited both aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Most strikingly, novel nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs were also obtained using the same synthetic strategy, demonstrating the superior versatility and efficiency of the proposed ring expansion method.

         <title>Fast Isomerization Before Isomerization&#8208;Hydroformylation: Probing the Neglected Period with A Novel Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to limits in heat and mass transfer, the acquisition of kinetic data of fast reactions has been historically challenging, especially for multiphasic reactions. Inspired by the concept of flash chemistry and radial synthesis, a novel microreactor was designed to study the initial fast isomerization process (within the first minute) in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation. A new type of isomerization pathway without the coordination of CO to rhodium center was found, which is dramatically faster than the known one.







Abstract
By combining the concept of flash chemistry and radial synthesis, a novel microreactor (Flashstop reactor) was designed to study isomerization process of hydroformylation by a Rh/tetraphosphite catalyst in a time scale of seconds. It was found that in the initial 313&#8197;seconds, 60&#8211;99&#8201;% of 1&#8208;octene was isomerized to 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;octenes before the formation of aldehydes. Within this period, two different types of isomerization reactions were observed. It was proposed that a monohydride complex without CO ligand accounts for the ultrafast isomerization in the initial 30&#8197;seconds. The isomerization rate with such monohydride species was calculated much faster than that with the well&#8208;known H(CO)Rh(P&#8722;P) species. Both experimental and DFT computational studies were carried out to support this assumption. Fast transformations early on in catalytic cycles have been rarely studied due to the lack of proper tools. We believe that the Flashstop reactor is a powerful tool for analysis of kinetics in gas&#8208;liquid biphasic reactions within a time scale of seconds to minutes.

         <title>A Direct Formaldehyde Fuel Cell for CO2&#8208;Emission Free Co&#8208;generation of Electrical Energy and Valuable Chemical/Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective 1&#8208;electron oxidation of formaldehyde enables co&#8208;generation of electricity and H2 with valuable formate in a direct formaldehyde fuel cell without CO2 pathway. This approach not only avoids greenhouse gas emissions but also eliminates negative effects of CO poisoning and carbonate generation.







Abstract
Converting carbon&#8208;based molecular fuels into electricity efficiently and cleanly without emitting CO2 remains a challenge. Conventional fuel cells using noble metals as anode catalysts often suffer performance degradation due to CO poisoning and a host of problems associated with CO2 production. This study provides a CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free direct formaldehyde fuel cell. It enables a flow of electricity while producing H2 and valuable formate. Unlike conventional carbon&#8208;based molecules electrooxidation, formaldehyde 1&#8208;electron oxidation is performed on the Cu anode with high selectivity, thus generating formate and H2 without undergoing CO2 pathway. In addition, the fuel cell produces 0.62&#8197;Nm3 H2 and 53&#8197;mol formate per 1&#8197;kWh of electricity generated, with an open circuit voltage of up to 1&#8197;V and a peak power density of 350&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This study puts forward a zero&#8208;carbon solution for the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;based molecule fuels that generates electricity, hydrogen and valuable chemicals in synchronization.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Efficient Ion Gating through Self&#8208;Assembled Two&#8208;Dimensional Photothermal Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane is shown to be an excellent nanofluidic platform for the smart regulation of transverse ion transport. It exhibits extremely high ion gating ratios (up to 104) due to its good photothermal performance. This approach may lead to applications of MOF membranes which have a variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.







Abstract
Biological ion channels regulate the ion flow across cell membrane via opening or closing of the pores in response to various external stimuli. Replicating the function of high ion gating effects with artificial porous materials has been challenging. Herein, we report that the self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane can serve as an excellent nanofluidic platform for smart regulation of ion transport. The MOF membrane with good photothermal performance exhibits extremely high ion gating ratio (up to 104), which is among the highest values in MOF membrane nanochannels for light&#8208;controlled ion gating reported so far. By repeatedly turning on and off the light, the nanofluidic device shows outstanding stability and reversibility that can be applied in the remote light&#8208;switching system. This work may spark promising applications of MOF membrane with variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.

         <title>Organic pH Buffer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic pH buffer strategy is proposed. N&#8208;containing organic molecules simultaneously control electrolyte pH, suppress hydrogen evolution, enable uniform Zn deposition, and inhibit shuttle of polyiodine compounds, achieving highly reversible and stable, long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine (I2) batteries are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, drawbacks include, Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion and, cathode &#8220;shuttle&#8221; of polyiodines. Here we report a class of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds as organic pH buffers to obviate these. We evidence that addition of pyridine /imidazole regulates electrolyte pH, and inhibits HER and anode corrosion. In addition, pyridine and imidazole preferentially absorb on Zn metal, regulating non&#8208;dendritic Zn plating /stripping, and achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;% and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3200&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It is also confirmed that pyridine inhibits polyiodines shuttling and boosts conversion kinetics for I&#8722;/I2. As a result, the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery exhibits long cycle stability of &gt;25&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and high specific capacity of 105.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We conclude organic pH buffer engineering is practical for dendrite&#8208;free and shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Complexes Featuring a cis&#8208;[M
U
M] Core (M=Rh, Ir): A New Route to Uranium&#8208;Metal Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes featuring two U
M double dative bonds are prepared from the reaction of heterometallic chlorine&#8208;bridged precursors with MeMgBr or MeLi. This study shows a novel synthetic method for complexes with U&#8722;M multiple bonds, and also provides new examples with which to investigate the bonding of 5&#8201;f&#8208;block actinide elements.







Abstract
Although examples of multiple bonds between actinide elements and main&#8208;group elements are quite common, studies of the multiple bonds between actinide elements and transition metals are extremely rare owing to difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here we report the first example of molecular uranium complexes featuring a cis&#8208;[M
U
M] core (M=Rh, Ir), which exhibits an unprecedented arrangement of two M
U double dative bond linkages to a single U center. These complexes were prepared by the reactions of chlorine&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{U{N(CH3)(CH2CH2NPiPr2)2}(Cl)2[(&#956;&#8208;Cl)M(COD)]2}] (M=Rh, Ir) with MeMgBr or MeLi, a new method for the construction of species with U&#8722;M multiple bonds. Theoretical calculations including dispersion confirmed the presence of two U
M double dative bonds in these complexes. This study not only enriches the U

     alt="Complexes Featuring a cis-[M&amp;#xA;U&amp;#xA;M] Core (M=Rh, Ir): A New Route to Uranium-Metal Multiple Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexes featuring two U
M double dative bonds are prepared from the reaction of heterometallic chlorine-bridged precursors with MeMgBr or MeLi. This study shows a novel synthetic method for complexes with U&#8722;M multiple bonds, and also provides new examples with which to investigate the bonding of 5&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-block actinide elements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although examples of multiple bonds between actinide elements and main-group elements are quite common, studies of the multiple bonds between actinide elements and transition metals are extremely rare owing to difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here we report the first example of molecular uranium complexes featuring a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-[M
U
M] core (M=Rh, Ir), which exhibits an unprecedented arrangement of two M
U double dative bond linkages to a single U center. These complexes were prepared by the reactions of chlorine-bridged heterometallic complexes [{U{N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NP&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}(Cl)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Cl)M(COD)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}] (M=Rh, Ir) with MeMgBr or MeLi, a new method for the construction of species with U&#8722;M multiple bonds. Theoretical calculations including dispersion confirmed the presence of two U
M double dative bonds in these complexes. This study not only enriches the U
M multiple bond chemistry, but also provides a new opportunity to explore the bonding of actinide elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first intermolecular enantioselective addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is described, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. This fundamental synthetically relevant transformation proceeds with high enantiomeric excesses and yields over a wide range of feedstock substrates, providing pharmaceutically relevant building blocks in a single step.







Abstract
Herein we describe the enantioselective intermolecular conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. The transformation provides the most direct access to pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroesters, utilizing feedstock chemicals, with unprecedented selectivity. The methodology exhibits a broad substrate scope, including &#946;&#8208;(fluoro)alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl substituted electrophiles, and was successfully applied on a gram scale with reduced catalyst loading, and, additionally, catalyst recovery was carried out. The formal synthesis of a range of drug molecules, and an enantioselective synthesis of (S)&#8208;rolipram were achieved. Additionally, computational studies revealed key reaction intermediates and transition state structures, and provided rationale for high enantioselectivities, in good agreement with experimental results.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Induced Site&#8208;Specific Etching Boosts Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen (1O2) specifically targets the N&#8208;adjacent atoms and acts as an etchant to realize site&#8208;specific etching of topological carbon defects neighboring the N&#8208;dopants, leading to a boosted intrinsic catalytic activity of the N&#8722;C sites in the resultant N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8722;N/C). The 1O2&#8722;N/C exhibits the highest half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915&#8197;VRHE toward oxygen reduction reaction among all the metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
Targeted construction of carbon defects near the N dopants is an intriguing but challenging way to boost the electrocatalytic activity of N&#8208;doped carbon toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel site&#8208;specific etching strategy that features targeted anchoring of singlet oxygen (1O2) on the N&#8208;adjacent atoms to directionally construct topological carbon defects neighboring the N dopants in N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8722;N/C). This 1O2&#8722;N/C exhibits the highest ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915&#8197;VRHE among all the reported metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts. Pyridinic&#8208;N bonded with a carbon pentagon of the neighboring topological carbon defects is identified as the primary active configuration, rendering enhanced adsorption of O2, optimized adsorption energy of the ORR intermediates, and a significantly decreased total energy barrier for ORR. This 1O2&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific etching strategy is also applicable to different precursors, showing a tremendous potential for targeted construction of high&#8208;efficiency active sites in carbon&#8208;based materials.

The quinone&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable onset potential of 0.83&#8197;eV vs. RHE in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and over 95&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The effectiveness of chair&#8208;form quinone groups as the most efficient active sites is highlighted by the reverse verification method, compared with other oxygen functional groups.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via a two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process provides a promising alternative to replace the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. Herein, we develop a facile template&#8208;protected strategy to synthesize a highly active quinone&#8208;rich porous carbon catalyst for H2O2 electrochemical production. The optimized PCC900 material exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity, of which the onset potential reaches 0.83&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and the H2O2 selectivity is over 95&#8201;% in a wide potential range. Comprehensive synchrotron&#8208;based near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy combined with electrocatalytic characterizations reveals the positive correlation between quinone content and 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR performance. The effectiveness of chair&#8208;form quinone groups as the most efficient active sites is highlighted by the molecule&#8208;mimic strategy and theoretical analysis.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Azulene&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Knoevenagel&#8208;Type Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and modular method has been developed for the construction of novel azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with good structure versatility. The chemical structures, aromaticity, and photophysical properties of the synthesized non&#8208;alternant PAHs are fully investigated. This strategy provides straightforward access and rapid construction of unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs, and possibly graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.







Abstract
The research interest in azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has significantly increased recently, but the lack of efficient synthetic strategies impedes the investigation of their structure&#8208;property relationships and further opto&#8208;electronic applications. Here we report a modular synthetic strategy towards diverse azulene&#8208;embedded PAHs by a tandem Suzuki coupling and base&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel&#8208;type condensation with good yields and great structural versatility, including non&#8208;alternant thiophene&#8208;rich PAHs, butterfly&#8208; or Z&#8208;shaped PAHs bearing two azulene units, and the first example of a two&#8208;azulene&#8208;embedded double [5]helicene. The structural topology, aromaticity and photophysical properties were investigated by NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy assisted by DFT calculations. This strategy provides a new platform for rapidly synthesizing unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs or even graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.

Combining N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with gold nanoparticles provides an ultrabright and fragment&#8208;free ionization platform for laser&#8208;desorption mass spectrometry. In their Research Article (e202219182), David&#8197;M. Jenkins, Jon&#8197;P. Camden, and co&#8208;workers show that NHC&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles can &#8220;give gold wings&#8221; in the mass spectrometer, enabling next&#8208;generation applications of mass barcoding, data storage, and bioconjugation reaction monitoring.

Elaborate metal&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems require highly robust organic emitters in the radical form. In their Research Article (e202301109), Keishiro Tahara, Masaaki Abe, and co&#8208;workers used the classical Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as an electrochemical protector of donor&#8211;acceptor emitters, leading to the discovery of Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement. The Lewis acid also converted the molecular arrangements of the emitters, playing a unique role in crystalline&#8208;film ECL.

A binap&#8208;ligated copper iodide dimer embedded on a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) was designed as an effective photoredox catalyst by Dan Li, Jian He, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202300233). Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, this heterogenized copper(I) complex promotes multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions initiated by N&#8722;O bond cleavage, with significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to its homogeneous counterparts. The use of a hydroxamic acid linker for post&#8208;synthetic modification renders the catalyst recyclable.

A modified seed&#8208;mediated approach using a chiral co&#8208;surfactant as capping ligand has been developed for the synthesis of intrinsically chiral gold dog&#8208;bone&#8208;shaped nanoparticles. The shape anisotropy at the edges was found to play a crucial role in driving the optical activity of these nanostructures, as reported by Jatish Kumar and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202300461). The intense plasmonic chirality observed in the visible and NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum can be of potential use in biosensing and enantioselective catalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical Reactors Enable Divergent Site Selectivity in the C&#8722;H Carboxylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general electrochemical strategy for the direct C&#8722;H carboxylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with CO2 by simply choosing different electrochemical setups has been reported by Yu, Lin, and co&#8208;workers, providing high&#8208;yielding access to divergent carboxylated products with excellent site selectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic and switchable C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes under easily tunable conditions is a robust but challenging tool for the construction of biologically relevant compounds. Recently, a general electrochemical strategy has been developed for the direct C&#8722;H carboxylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with CO2, and by simply choosing different types of cell setups, carboxylated products are furnished with excellent and tunable site selectivity. This study also paves the way for regulating the reactivity modes in electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure&#8208;Performance Relationships in Designing Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring acceptors for organic solar cells are presented in this Review from the viewpoint of materials design. The cencepts of noncovalent interactions, insertion of sterically hindered side chains, and planarization of the molecular backbone by conformational locking are summarized toward the design of high&#8208;performance materials.







Abstract
The prerequisite for commercially viable organic solar cells (OSC) is to reduce the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost gap. Therefore, the cost of organic materials should be reduced by minimizing the synthetic steps, yet maintaining the molecular planarity and efficiencies achieved by the fused ring acceptors (FRA). In this respect, developing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRA) with suitable functionalization to favor conformational planarity and effective molecular packing is beneficial and cost&#8208;effective. Presently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for NFRAs is around 16&#8201;%, yet lower than the 19&#8201;% achieved for FRAs. Despite their potential, a thorough understanding of the effective structural design of NFRAs is necessary for developing efficient OSCs. This article pays special attention to the molecular design concept for NFRAs developed in the last years and analyzed the approach toward materials design and efficiency improvement, an important step toward technological application.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Amorphization in 2D Materials: Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent achievements in the fabrication of amorphous nanomaterials with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) and discusses the underlying amorphization mechanism. The application of amorphous nanomaterials in different fields is summarized, thus demonstrating the prospects of SC CO2.







Abstract
Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2)&#8208;assisted chemical and material processing has shown great success in the fabrication of 2D amorphous materials, while the amorphization mechanism in SC CO2 is quite complicated to be understand. In this review, we introduce different kinds of 2D amorphous materials prepared with SC CO2 and discuss the possible amorphization mechanism and how they affect the structures and properties of 2D materials. Their applications are further presented and discussed. In addition, the prospective of future development of SC CO2&#8208;assisted fabrication of 2D amorphous materials is also involved. The investigation of SC CO2 induced amorphization not only provides theoretic understanding of amorphization process, but also directs to the preparation and application of 2D amorphous materials with specific structure and property, suggesting the promising future of SC CO2&#8208;assisted process in material design and engineering.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Polymerization via C&#8722;H Activation for the Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) via C&#8722;H activation is the latest addition in the repertoire of synthetic strategies towards conjugated polymers. This article captures the development of this polymerization strategy in the light of background small molecule reactions and highlights how its approach is greener than the previous methods. Arene&#8211;arene and arene&#8211;alkene couplings via transition metal catalysts have been explored for CDC polymerization.







Abstract
Owing to their versatile (opto)electronic properties, conjugated polymers have found application in several organic electronic devices. Cross&#8208;coupling reactions such as Stille, Suzuki, Kumada couplings, and direct arylation reactions have proved to be effective for their synthesis. More atom&#8208;efficient oxidative direct arylation polymerization has also been reported for making homopolymers. However, growing interest toward donor&#8208;acceptor polymers has led to the recent emergence of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) polymerization to synthesize alternating copolymers without any prefunctionalization of monomers. Metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two simple arenes via double C&#8722;H activation, or of an arene with an alkene via oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction have been used so far for CDC polymerization. In this article, we discuss the development of CDC polymerization protocols along with the relevant small molecule CDC reactions for an improved understanding of these reactions.

         <title>Immunogenic Cell Death Inducing Metal Complexes for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. Among other approaches, much research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death triggering compounds is systematically reviewed.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Recent statistics have shown that metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. While traditional treatments are able to efficiently remove the primary tumor, secondary tumors remain poorly accessible. Capitalizing on this there is an urgent need for novel treatment modalities. Among the most promising approaches, increasing research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Preliminary studies have shown that immunogenic cell death inducing compounds could be able to overcome metastatic and relapsing tumors. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death inducing compounds is systematically reviewed.

Preliminary studies have shown that immunogenic cell death inducing compounds could be able to overcome metastatic and relapsing tumors. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death inducing compounds is systematically reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lipophilicity Modulations by Fluorination Correlate with Membrane Partitioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state 19F MAS&#8197;NMR method was developed to accurately and easily measure water&#8208;membrane partitioning values (Kp). Given the very different octanol and membrane environments, a remarkable correlation between logKp and logP was found, but only for a given compound series. This work indicates that even minor lipophilicity modulations by aliphatic fluorination can have true relevance for the drug discovery optimization process.







Abstract
Bioactive compounds generally need to cross membranes to arrive at their site of action. The octanol&#8208;water partition coefficient (lipophilicity, logPOW) has proven to be an excellent proxy for membrane permeability. In modern drug discovery, logPOW and bioactivity are optimized simultaneously, for which fluorination is one of the relevant strategies. The question arises as to which extent the often subtle logP modifications resulting from different aliphatic fluorine&#8208;motif introductions also lead to concomitant membrane permeability changes, given the difference in molecular environment between octanol and (anisotropic) membranes. It was found that for a given compound class, there is excellent correlation between logPOW values with the corresponding membrane molar partitioning coefficients (logKp); a study enabled by novel solid&#8208;state 19F NMR MAS methodology using lipid vesicles. Our results show that the factors that cause modulation of octanol&#8208;water partition coefficients similarly affect membrane permeability.

         <title>Bifunctional NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type Reaction of 5&#8208;(Chloromethyl)furfural via Trienolate Intermediates</title>

NHC&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF), an important biomass&#8208;derived platform chemical, with aldimines afford chiral amines in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The use of a bifunctional NHC bearing a free hydroxy group enabled the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine to occur in a highly stereocontrolled manner.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of the biomass&#8208;derived platform compound 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) with imines were developed. A series of high&#8208;value&#8208;added chiral amines were afforded in good to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The bifunctional NHC derived from &#671;&#8208;pyroglutamic acid efficiently steered the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine in a highly stereocontrolled manner. This represents the first enantioselective reaction proceeding via an NHC&#8208;bound trienolate intermediate.

         <title>Synthesis of Erythrocyte Nanodiscs for Bacterial Toxin Neutralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanodiscs are small discoidal lipid bilayer assemblies and represent an attractive nanomedicine platform. While most nanodiscs are made with synthetic lipid bilayers, this work reports on a nanodisc formulation made with natural human red blood cell membrane and demonstrates its robust application for bacterial toxin neutralization.







Abstract
Nanodiscs are a compelling nanomedicine platform due to their ultrasmall size and distinct disc shape. Current nanodisc formulations are made primarily with synthetic lipid bilayers and proteins. Here, we report a cellular nanodisc made with human red blood cell (RBC) membrane (denoted &#8220;RBC&#8208;ND&#8221;) and show its effective neutralization against bacterial toxins. In vitro, RBC&#8208;ND neutralizes the hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity caused by purified &#945;&#8208;toxin or complex whole secreted proteins (wSP) from methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. In vivo, RBC&#8208;ND confers significant survival benefits for mice intoxicated with &#945;&#8208;toxin or wSP in both therapeutic and prevention regimens. Moreover, RBC&#8208;ND shows good biocompatibility and biosafety in vivo. Overall, RBC&#8208;ND distinguishes itself by inheriting the biological functions of the source cell membrane for bioactivity. The design strategy of RBC&#8208;ND can be generalized to other types of cell membranes for broad applications.

         <title>Linear and Bent Cp*2Si: Reversible Phase Transition of a Key Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organometallic lighthouse molecule Cp*2SiII was always the odd one out of the heavier homologues. In the solid&#8208;state counterintuitively there is a linear molecule next to two bent ones. While the latter is more stable, the linear conformer was mainly attributed to fuzzy packing effects. Now it is clear that the linearity has to be attributed to entropy in the room temperature phase while the bending is due to dispersion of the rings in the 80&#8197;K phase.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;state structure of decamethylsilicocene Cp*2Si with a bent and a linear molecule in the same unit cell was so far considered an exception in relation to the structures of its all&#8208;bent heavier analogues Cp*2E with E=Ge, Sn, Pb. Here, we present the solution to this conundrum by reporting a low&#8208;temperature phase, where all three symmetrically independent molecules are present in a bent formation. This reversible enantiotropic phase transition occurs in the temperature range between 80&#8197;K and 130&#8197;K and provides a rationale for the unexpected linear molecule based in entropy beyond hand&#8208;waving explanations such as electronic reasons or packing effects.

         <title>Synthesis of Cationic Biphen[4, 5]arenes as Biofilm Disruptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic biphen[n]arenes were designed and synthesized, which could inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate stubborn mature biofilms. Moreover, their effective complexation with the conventional antibiotic cefazolin sodium could further enhance the biofilm disruption efficacy in vitro and synergistically improve the healing effect in E.&#8197;coli&#8208;infected mice.







Abstract
Since bacteria in biofilms are inherently resistant to antibiotics and biofilm&#8208;associated infections pose a serious threat to global public health, new therapeutic agents and schemes are urgently needed to meet clinical requirements. Here two quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized biphen[n]arenes (WBPn, n=4, 5) were designed and synthesized with excellent anti&#8208;biofilm potency. Not only could they inhibit the assembly of biofilms, but also eradicate intractable mature biofilms formed by Gram&#8208;positive S.&#8197;aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli bacterial strains. Moreover, they could strongly complex a conventional antibiotic, cefazolin sodium (CFZ) with complex stability constants of (7.41&#177;0.29)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 for CFZ/WBP4 and (4.98&#177;0.49)&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 for CFZ/WBP5. Combination of CFZ by WBP4 and WBP5 synergistically enhanced biofilm eradication performance in vitro and statistically improved healing efficacy on E.&#8197;coli&#8208;infected mice models, providing a novel supramolecular strategy for combating biofilm&#8208;associated infections.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since bacteria in biofilms are inherently resistant to antibiotics and biofilm-associated infections pose a serious threat to global public health, new therapeutic agents and schemes are urgently needed to meet clinical requirements. Here two quaternary ammonium-functionalized biphen[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]arenes (WBPn, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=4, 5) were designed and synthesized with excellent anti-biofilm potency. Not only could they inhibit the assembly of biofilms, but also eradicate intractable mature biofilms formed by Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;aureus&lt;/i&gt; and Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; bacterial strains. Moreover, they could strongly complex a conventional antibiotic, cefazolin sodium (CFZ) with complex stability constants of (7.41&#177;0.29)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for CFZ/WBP4 and (4.98&#177;0.49)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for CFZ/WBP5. Combination of CFZ by WBP4 and WBP5 synergistically enhanced biofilm eradication performance &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and statistically improved healing efficacy on &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice models, providing a novel supramolecular strategy for combating biofilm-associated infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Morphological Profiling Identifies the Motor Protein Eg5 as Cellular Target of Spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>

Functional group&#8208;controlled, RhIII&#8208;catalyzed scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles in combination with unbiased morphological bioactivity profiling reveal a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.







Abstract
Oxindoles and iso&#8208;oxindoles are natural product&#8208;derived scaffolds that provide inspiration for the design and synthesis of novel biologically relevant compound classes. Notably, the spirocyclic connection of oxindoles with iso&#8208;oxindoles has not been explored by nature but promises to provide structurally related compounds endowed with novel bioactivity. Therefore, methods for their efficient synthesis and the conclusive discovery of their cellular targets are highly desirable. We describe a selective RhIII&#8208;catalyzed scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles from differently protected diazooxindoles and N&#8208;pivaloyloxy aryl amides which includes a functional group&#8208;controlled Lossen rearrangement as key step. Unbiased morphological profiling of a corresponding compound collection in the Cell Painting assay efficiently identified the mitotic kinesin Eg5 as the cellular target of the spirooxindoles, defining a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.

         <title>Catalyst Control over Threefold Stereogenicity: Selective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Sulfones with Stereogenic C&#8722;S Axes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of catalyst control over threefold stereogenic C&#8722;S atropisomers is reported. A catalytic oxidation sequence of triptycyl thioethers via sulfoxides to sulfones with a stereogenic C(sp3)&#8722;S axis proceeds with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol, while stereodivergence was possible to address each of the three atropisomers.







Abstract
Catalyst control over higher&#8208;order stereogenicity addresses significantly extended stereochemical space, but selective methods to govern threefold stereogenic units remained elusive. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of threefold stereogenic triptycyl sulfones with atropisomerism arising from a C(sp3)&#8722;S bond. An oxidation of a stereodynamic thioether controlled by a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst allowed selective access to enantioenriched triptycyl sulfoxides. The ensuing enantiospecific and diastereoselective catalytic oxidation to a threefold stereogenic sulfone provided overall control over the stereogenic C&#8722;S axis. All three stereoisomers were addressable with enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergence and a stereoselectivity of up to (&#8722;sc):&#8201;(+sc)&#8201;:&#8201;(ap)=94&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8201;:&lt;1.

         <title>A Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for OER and ORR based on a Cobalt(II) Triazole Pyridine Bis&#8208;[Cobalt(III) Corrole] Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing the structure of the catalyst, possessing CoII and CoIII reaction centers, we achieve nearly 100&#8201;% selective activity during ORR to H2O2. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% for oxygen evolution, and an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 are combined with a superior stability.







Abstract
As alternative energy sources are essential to reach a climate&#8208;neutral economy, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as futuristic energy carrier gains enormous awareness. However, seeking for stable and electrochemically selective H2O2 ORR electrocatalyst is yet a challenge, making the design of&#8212;ideally&#8212;bifunctional catalysts extremely important and outmost of interest. In this study, we explore the application of a trimetallic cobalt(II) triazole pyridine bis&#8208;[cobalt(III) corrole] complex CoIITP[CoIIIC]2 3 in OER and ORR catalysis due to its remarkable physicochemical properties, fast charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical reversibility, and durability. With nearly 100&#8201;% selective catalytic activity towards the two&#8208;electron transfer generated H2O2, an ORR onset potential of 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE and a cycling stability of 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles are detected. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, Faraday efficiency 98&#8201;% for oxygen, an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 combined with superior stability.

         <title>Reactivity of Glutaconamides Within [2]Rotaxanes: Mechanical Bond Controlled Chemoselective Synthesis of Highly Reactive &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides and their Light&#8208;Triggered Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical interlocking of glutaconamides is crucial for their chemoselective oxidation to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. These unprecedented species were satisfactorily employed in blue&#8208;light&#8208;driven cyclizations to divergently provide hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;azetidinones or oxazolidinones through two modes of the Norrish/Yang type&#8208;II reaction. This behavior starkly differs from that of the non&#8208;interlocked substrates under the same reaction conditions.







Abstract
Glutaconamide&#8208;based [2]rotaxanes are efficiently oxidized to the respective interlocked &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, whereas their non&#8208;interlocked threads afford hydroxycyclohexene tetraamides under similar reaction conditions. These results showcase the mechanically interlocking of highly reactive substrates as a powerful tool for controlling their chemical behavior. Inside the macrocycle and under irradiation with light, the &#945;&#8208;ketoamide threads convert, in a divergent manner, into the corresponding interlocked hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams or oxazolidinones by two modes of Norrish/Yang type&#8208;II intramolecular cyclizations, processes that are efficiently chemocontrolled by the mechanical bond.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Oxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation is reported. A broad range of alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and characterized, and was found to be a key intermediate in this reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base.







Abstract
Metalla&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenation represents one of the most straightforward and sustainable approaches to access valuable oxygenated molecules. Despite the significant advances, the development of enantioselective electrochemical C&#8722;H oxygenation reaction is very challenging and remains elusive. Herein, we described the first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation. A broad range of enantioenriched alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). An unusual cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and fully characterized, which was proven to be a key intermediate of this C&#8722;H alkoxylation reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base and the whole process proceeded through a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropanes from Carbon Pronucleophiles and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for diastereoselective cyclopropanation from unactivated alkenes and acidic carbon pronucleophiles is reported. The method is scalable and amenable to synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are desirable structural motifs with valuable applications in drug discovery and beyond. Established alkene cyclopropanation methods give rise to cyclopropanes with a limited array of substituents, are difficult to scale, or both. Herein, we disclose a new cyclopropane synthesis through the formal coupling of abundant carbon pronucleophiles and unactivated alkenes. This strategy exploits dicationic adducts derived from electrolysis of thianthrene in the presence of alkene substrates. We find that these dielectrophiles undergo cyclopropanation with methylene pronucleophiles via alkenyl thianthrenium intermediates. This protocol is scalable, proceeds with high diastereoselectivity, and tolerates diverse functional groups on both the alkene and pronucleophile coupling partners. To validate the utility of this new procedure, we prepared an array of substituted analogs of an established cyclopropane that is en route to multiple pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Dimer Acceptor Adopting a Flexible Linker for Efficient and Durable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimer acceptor with flexible linker was designed and synthesized, which not only acts as the third component to enhance the intermolecular packing, but also stabilizes the morphology by suppressing the molecular diffusion. As a result, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO based organic solar cells exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 18.41&#8201;% with excellent thermal/photo stability and mechanical performance.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have advanced rapidly due to the development of new photovoltaic materials. However, the long&#8208;term stability of OSCs still poses a severe challenge for their commercial deployment. To address this issue, a dimer acceptor (dT9TBO) with flexible linker is developed for incorporation into small&#8208;molecule acceptors to form molecular alloy with enhanced intermolecular packing and suppressed molecular diffusion to stabilize active layer morphology. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO&#8208;based device displays an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.41&#8201;% with excellent thermal stability and negligible decay after being aged at 65 &#176;C for 1800&#8197;h. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO&#8208;based flexible OSC also exhibits excellent mechanical durability, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial PCE after being bended repetitively for 1500&#8197;cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to fine&#8208;tune the molecular packing with stabilized morphology to overcome the trade&#8208;off between OSC efficiency and stability.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Initiated Radical/Polar Crossover Annulation Cascade for Expedient Access to Complex Tetralins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical/polar crossover manifold permits annulations between allylarenes and Giese&#8208;type accepters, providing a route to functionalized tetralins. The reaction conditions are mild and therefore exhibit significant functional group tolerance. The annulation products are formally cycloadducts of styrenes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, and they can be used to form a variety of strained ring products.







Abstract
A radical/polar crossover annulation between allyl&#8208;substituted arenes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is described. Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) facilitates tandem radical C&#8722;C bond formation that generates functionalized tetralin products in the face of potentially problematic hydrofluorination, hydroalkoxylation, hydrogenation, alkene isomerization, and radical polymerization reactions. The reactions proceed under mild conditions that tolerate many functional groups, leading to a broad substrate scope. This powerful ring&#8208;forming reaction very quickly assembles complex tetralins that are the formal products of the largely infeasible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions of styrenes.

         <title>A Team for Accelerating Catalyst and Reaction Developmen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 21, May 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Experience in both catalyst and reaction design is required to solve remaining limitations and to set new standards &#8230; In contrast to previous studies, we aimed at the design of new catalysts based on data rather than on chemical intuition.&#8220; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Gessner and Goo&#223;en groups on accelerating catalyst and reaction development.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Gessner and Goo&#223;en research groups at Ruhr&#8208;University Bochum (Germany). They recently published a series of articles in Angewandte Chemie on the application of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines (YPhos) in palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. Owing to their inherently strong sigma&#8208;donating ability and their modular synthesis, YPhos ligands can be tailored to fit the demands of various catalytic transformations. In the most recent article, machine learning methods were applied to identify a YPhos catalyst that enables the previously elusive Hiyama coupling of aryl chlorides. &#8220;Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings&#8221;, J.&#8197;F. Goebel, J. L&#246;ffler, Z. Zeng, J. Handelmann, A. Hermann, I. Rodstein, T. Gensch, V.&#8197;H. Gessner, L.&#8197;J. Goo&#223;en, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202216160; Angew.
