      <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative multicomponent reactions (MCRs) involving olefins and C&#8211;N electrophiles are a powerful tool to rapidly build up molecular complexity. The products from these reactions contain multiple functionalities, such as amino, cyano and boronate groups, that are ubiquitous in medicinal and process chemistry programs. Copper&#8208;catalyzed MCRs are particularly attractive because they use a relatively abundant and non&#8208;toxic catalyst to selectively deliver high&#8208;value products from simple feedstocks such as olefins.

      <title>Thermally activated adsorption in metal&#8208;organic frameworks with a temperature&#8208;tunable diffusion barrier layer</title>
      <dc:description>Modification of the external surfaces of metal organic frameworks offers a new level of control over their adsorption behavior. We have previously shown that capping of MOFs with ethylenediamine (EDA) can effectively retain small gaseous molecules [Nat. Comm. 2016, 7, 13871] at room temperature. Here, we report a temperature&#8208;induced variation in the capping&#8208;layer gate opening mechanism through a combination of in situ IR experiments and ab initio simulations of the capping layer. We find an atypical acceleration and increase in the loading of weakly adsorbed molecules upon raising the temperature above room temperature. Our findings show the discovery of a novel temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics that goes beyond standard kinetics and suggest a new avenue for tailoring selective adsorption by thermally tuning the surface barrier.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Packing Drives Morphological Transition of Charged Surfactant Micelles</title>
      <dc:description>The shape and size of self&#8208;assembled structures upon local organization of their molecular building blocks are hard to predict in the presence of long&#8208;range interactions. Combining small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray/neutron scattering data, theoretical modelling, and com&#8208; puter simulations, we investigate sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in a broad range of concentrations and ionic strengths. Computer simulations indicate that micellar shape changes are associated with different binding of the counterions. Employing a toy model based on point charges on a surface, we demonstrate that the observed morphological changes are caused by symmetry breaking of the irreducible building blocks, with the formation of transient surfactant dimers mediated by the counterions that promote the stabilization of cylindrical instead of spherical micelles. The present model is of general applicability and can be extended to all systems controlled by the presence of mobile charges.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermal&#8208;Gated Polymer Electrolytes for Smart Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The smart self&#8208;protection is essential to avoid the safety issue of energy storage devices. However, conventional strategies based on sol&#8208;gel transition electrolytes often suffer from unstable self&#8208;recovery performance. Herein, smart separators based on thermal&#8208;gated poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel electrolytes were developed for rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Such PNIPAM&#8208;based separators not only display a pore structure evolution from opened to closed state, but also exhibit a surface wettability transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behaviors when the temperature rises. This can suppress the migration of electrolyte ions across the separators, realizing the self&#8208;protection of ZIBs at high temperature. Furthermore, the thermal&#8208;gated behavior is highly reversible even after multiple heating/cooling cycles due to the reversibility of temperature&#8208;dependent structural evolution and hydrophilic/hydrophobic transition. This work will pave the way for designing thermal&#8208;responsive energy storage devices with safe and controlled energy delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>X&#8208;Ray Crystallography and Free Energy Calculations Reveal the Binding Mechanism of A2A Adenosine Receptor Antagonists.</title>
      <dc:description>We present a robust protocol based on iterations of free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, chemical synthesis, biophysical mapping and X&#8208;ray crystallography to reveal the binding mode of an antagonist series to the adenosine A  2A  receptor (AR). Eight A  2A  AR binding site mutations from biophysical mapping experiments were initially analysed with sidechain FEP simulations, performed on alternate binding modes. The results distinctively supported one binding mode, which was subsequently used to design new chromone derivatives. Their affinities for the A  2A  AR were experimentally determined and investigated through a cycle of ligand&#8208;FEP calculations, validating the binding orientation of the different chemical substituents proposed. Subsequent X&#8208;ray crystallography of the A2AAR with a low and a high affinity chromone derivative confirmed the predicted binding orientation. The new molecules and structures here reported were driven by free energy calculations, and provide new insights on antagonist binding to the A  2A  AR, an emerging target in immuno&#8208;oncology.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct atomic level imaging of Zeolites: Oxygen, Na in Na&#8208;LTA and Fe in Fe&#8208;MFI</title>

      <title>Dynamic covalent formation of concave disulfide macrocycles mechanically interlocked with single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes</title>
      <dc:description>The formation of discrete macrocycles wrapped around single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has recently emerged as an appealing strategy to functionalize these carbon nanomaterials and modify their properties.

Specifically, a combination of UV/vis/NIR, Raman, photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and transient absorption spectroscopies indicated that the small (6,4)&#8208;

SWCNTs were predominantly functionalized by the small macrocycles  1  2  , whereas the larger (6,5)&#8208;SWCNTs were an ideal match for the larger macrocycles  2  2  . The observation of size selectivity, which was rationalized computationally, could prove useful for the purification of nanotube mixtures, because we were able to remove the disulfide macrocycles quantitatively under mild reductive conditions.</dc:description>

A direct one&#8208;step route from amino C&#8208;N bonds electrooxidation to nitrile C&#8801;N bonds offer an alternative pathway for nitriles producting. However, this promising topic has not been fully explored whether the chemical bond reforming process or the performance optimization. Here we proposed a model of vacancies&#8208;rich Ni(OH)2 atomic layer to understand performance relationship with structure. By theory calculations, the vacancy&#8208;induced local electropositive site chemisorbs the N atom with lone pairs of electrons and then attack the corresponding N(sp3)&#8208;H, thus accelerating amino C&#8208;N bond activates dehydrogenation directly into nitrile C&#8801;N bond. Vacancies&#8208;rich nanosheets exhibit up to 96.5% propionitrile selectivity at a moderately potential of 1.38 V. These findings will initiate a new pathway for triggering stubborn catalytic reaction in the chemicals industry.</dc:description>

      <title>The Direct Partial Oxidation of Methane to Dimethyl Ether over Pt/Y2O3 Catalysts Using an NO/O&#173;2 Shuttle</title>
      <dc:description>Using a mixture of NO+O  2  as the oxidant enabled the direct selective oxidation of methane to dimethyl ether (DME) over Pt/Y  2  O  3  . The reaction was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 0.1 MPa over a temperature range of 275&#8208;375  o  C. During the activity tests, the only carbon&#8208;containing products were DME and CO  2  . The DME productivity (&#181;mol g  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) was comparable to oxygenate productivities reported in the literature for strong oxidants (N  2  O, H  2  O  2  , O  3  ). The NO+O  2  mixture formed NO  2  which acted as the oxygen atom carrier for the ultimate oxidant O  2  . During the methane partial oxidation reaction, NO and NO  2  were not reduced to N&#173;&#173;  2  . In situ FTIR showed the formation of surface nitrate species, that are considered to be key intermediate species for the selective oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanically Assisted Bioluminescence with Natural Luciferase</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanochemical analogues have been recently established for several enzymatic reactions, however they require periodic interruption of the reaction for sampling, dissolution, and (bio)chemical analysis to monitor their progress. By applying a mechanochemical protocol to induce bioluminescence analogous to that used by the marine ostracod  Cypridina  (  Vargula  )  hilgendorfii  here we demonstrate that the light emitted by a bioluminescent reaction can be used for direct monitoring of the progress of a mechanoenzymatic reaction without sampling.

      <title>Highly Conducting and Flexible Radical Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Together with high conductivity, high flexibility is an important property required for the next generation organic electronic components. Both properties are difficult to achieve together especially when the components are crystalline due to the intrinsic high brittleness of organic molecular crystals. We report an organic radical crystal system that has both high flexibility and high conductivity. The crystal consists of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene radical cation (  BPEA  &#183;+  ) units, and shows flexibility under pressure with high conductivity in ambient condition exhibiting average conductivity of 2.68 S cm  &#8208;1  when normal linear shape, as well as 2.43 S cm  &#8208;1  when bent. The structural analysis reveals that both a short &#960;&#8208;&#960; distance (3.290 &#197;) between  BPEA  &#183;+  units that are aligned along the crystal length direction, and the presence of PF  6  &#8208;  counter ions induce flexiblity and high electircal conductivity.</dc:description>

The crystal consists of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene radical cation (  BPEA  &#183;+  ) units, and shows flexibility under pressure with high conductivity in ambient condition exhibiting average conductivity of 2.68 S cm  &#8208;1  when normal linear shape, as well as 2.43 S cm  &#8208;1  when bent. The structural analysis reveals that both a short &#960;&#8208;&#960; distance (3.290 &#197;) between  BPEA  &#183;+  units that are aligned along the crystal length direction, and the presence of PF  6  &#8208;  counter ions induce flexiblity and high electircal conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Activity&#8208;based Genetically Encoded Fluorescent and Luminescent Probes for Detecting Formaldehyde in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Formaldehyde (FA) is endogenously produced in living systems through a variety of biological processes, and has been implicated in many pathological conditions. Detection tools for biological FA are, therefore, of great interest. Here we report novel activity&#8208;based genetically encoded fluorescent and luminescent probes for detecting FA in aqueous solutions and living mammalian cells. A FA&#8208;reactive lysine analogue, PrAK, was site&#8208;specifically incorporated into the essential lysine sites of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase (fLuc) to afford the fluorescent and luminescent probes, respectively. FA selectively reacts with the PrAK residues on EGFP and fLuc through 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, resulting in fluorescence and luminescence turn&#8208;on responses, respectively, to FA over potentially interfering reactive species in aqueous buffer. Moreover, the genetically encoded probes are capable of visualizing FA at physiologically relevant levels in living mammalian cells by fluorescence and luminescence imaging, demonstrating their potential as new tools to explore FA biology.</dc:description>

      <title>Cooperativity of Catechols and Amines in High Performance Dry/Wet Adhesives</title>
      <dc:description>The outstanding adhesive performance of mussel byssal threads has been a beacon of inspiration for materials scientists over the past few decades. Historically, presence of a significant amount of the unique catecholic amino acid dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) has been considered to play a key role in strong dry and wet adhesive properties of the byssal interfacial proteins. In recent years, molecular and microscopic level studies using short peptides or small molecule analogs have investigated the roles of other amino acids in mussel adhesion. In particular, these studies have highlighted the cohesive role of cation&#8208;&#960; interactions as well as the adhesive synergy between Dopa and flanking lysine residues. Inspired to design advanced synthetic adhesives that exploit amino&#8208;catechol synergy, we synthesized polymeric pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) by copolymerizing traditional PSA monomers, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid, with mussel&#8208;inspired lysine&#8208; and aromatic&#8208;rich monomers. Of particular interest was to compare the consequences of decoupling amino and catechol moieties from each other (i.e. incorporated as separate monomers) versus a monomer architecture in which the catechol and amine were coupled together in a fixed orientation in the monomer side chain. Comprehensive multi&#8208;scale adhesion assays were used to probe performance at the molecular, microscopic and macroscopic levels through a combination of AFM&#8208;assisted force spectroscopy, peel and static shear adhesion. We showed that coupling of catechols and amines together within the same monomer side chain produced optimal cooperative effects in improving macroscopic adhesion performance. The findings in this study improve our understanding of underlying principles of mussel adhesion and provide a solid framework for rational design of high&#8208;performance bioinspired adhesives.</dc:description>

      <title>Wetting phenomena and their effect on the electrochemical performance of surface&#8208;tailored lithium metal electrodes in contact with cross&#8208;linked polymeric electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>Li metal batteries (LMBs) containing cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolytes (PEs) are auspicious candidates for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the wetting behavior of PEs on uneven Li metal surfaces has been neglected in most studies.

The appearance of micro&#8208;scale defects and phase separation are identified as key causes for erratic nucleation. It is emphasized that the implementation of stable and consistent long&#8208;term cycling performance of LMBs using PEs requires a deeper understanding of the &#8220;soft&#8208;solid&#8221;&#8208;solid contact between PEs and inherently rough Li metal surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Inducing social self&#8208;sorting in organic cages to tune the shape of the internal cavity</title>
      <dc:description>Many interesting target guest molecules have low symmetry, yet most methods for synthesising hosts result in highly symmetrical capsules. Methods of generating lower&#8208;symmetry pores are thus required to maximise the binding affinity in host&#8208;guest complexes. Here, we use mixtures of tetraaldehyde building blocks to access low&#8208;symmetry imine cages. Whether a low&#8208;energy cage is isolated can be correctly predicted from the thermodynamic preference observed in computational models. The stability of the observed structures depends on the geometrical match of the aldehyde building blocks. One bent aldehyde stands out as unable to assemble into high&#8208;symmetry cages&#8212;and the same aldehyde generates low&#8208;symmetry socially self&#8208;sorted cages when combined with a linear aldehyde. We exploit this finding to synthesise a family of low&#8208;symmetry cages containing heteroatoms, illustrating that pores of varying geometries and surface chemistries may be reliably accessed through computational prediction and self&#8208;sorting.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many interesting target guest molecules have low symmetry, yet most methods for synthesising hosts result in highly symmetrical capsules. Methods of generating lower&#8208;symmetry pores are thus required to maximise the binding affinity in host&#8208;guest complexes. Here, we use mixtures of tetraaldehyde building blocks to access low&#8208;symmetry imine cages. Whether a low&#8208;energy cage is isolated can be correctly predicted from the thermodynamic preference observed in computational models. The stability of the observed structures depends on the geometrical match of the aldehyde building blocks. One bent aldehyde stands out as unable to assemble into high&#8208;symmetry cages&#8212;and the same aldehyde generates low&#8208;symmetry socially self&#8208;sorted cages when combined with a linear aldehyde. We exploit this finding to synthesise a family of low&#8208;symmetry cages containing heteroatoms, illustrating that pores of varying geometries and surface chemistries may be reliably accessed through computational prediction and self&#8208;sorting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sensitive morphological characterization of oriented high&#8208;density lipoprotein nanoparticles using&#160;31P NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The biological function of high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL) nanoparticles, the so&#8208;called good cholesterol that is associated with a low risk of heart disease, depends on their composition, morphology and size. The morphology of HDL particles composed of apolipoproteins, lipids and cholesterol is routinely visualised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), but higher&#8208;resolution tools are needed to observe more subtle structural differences between particles of different composition. Here, reconstituted HDL formulations are oriented on glass substrates and solid&#8208;state  31  P NMR spectroscopy is shown to be highly sensitive to the surface curvature of the lipid headgroups. The spectra report potentially functionally important differences in the morphology of different HDL preparations that are not detected by TEM. This method provides new morphological insights into HDL comprising a naturally&#8208;occurring apolipoprotein A&#8208;I mutant, which may be linked to its atheroprotective properties, and holds promise as a future research tool in the clinical analysis of plasma HDL.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantifying Through&#8208;Space Substituent Effects</title>
      <dc:description>The description of substituents as electron donating or withdrawing leads to a perceived dominance of through&#8208;bond influences. The situation is compounded by the challenge of separating through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space contributions. Here, we probe the experimental significance of through&#8208;space substituent effects in molecular interactions and reaction kinetics. Conformational equilibrium constants were transposed onto the Hammett substituent constant scale revealing dominant through&#8208;space substituent effects that cannot be described in classic terms. For example, NO  2  groups positioned over a biaryl bond exhibited similar influences as resonant electron donors. Meanwhile, the electro&#8208;enhancing influence of OMe/OH groups could be switched off or inverted by conformational twisting. 267 conformational equilibrium constants measured across eleven solvents were found to be better predictors of reaction kinetics than calculated electrostatic potentials, suggesting utility in other contexts and for benchmarking theoretical solvation models.</dc:description>

      <title>The Stabilization Effect of CO2 Chemistries in Li&#8208;O2/CO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The lithium (Li)&#8208;air battery possesses ultrahigh theoretical specific energy, however, even in pure oxygen (O  2  ), the vulnerability of conventional organic electrolytes and carbon cathodes towards reaction intermediates, especially O  2  &#8208;  , and corrosive oxidation and crack/pulverization of Li metal anode lead to poor cycling stability of the Li&#8208;air battery. Even worse, the water and/or CO  2  in air are reported to bring more serious parasitic reactions and security issues. Therefore, most significant improvements are achieved in pure O  2  , and thus the making &#8220;onboard&#8221; pure oxygen supply system is inevitable for practical Li&#8208;air battery, which not only reduces the energy density of the overall system, but also makes the system complex and expensive to produce and maintain. Therefore, realizing the ultimate goal of applying such systems in open&#8208;air environment is a demanding requirement. Here, contrary to previous assertions, we found that CO  2  could improve the stability of both anode and electrolyte, and a high&#8208;performance rechargeable Li&#8208;O  2  /CO  2  battery is then developed. The introduced CO  2  can not only facilitate the  in situ  formation of a passivated protective Li  2  CO  3  film on Li anode, but also restrain side reactions involving electrolyte and cathode by capturing O  2  &#8208;  . Moreover, the Pd/CNT catalyst in cathode can extend the battery lifespan by effectively tuning the product morphology and catalyzing the decomposition of Li&#173;  2  CO  3  . By simultaneously addressing the bottleneck problems of poor rechargeability, instability of carbon cathode, liquid electrolyte and Li anode, the designed Li&#8208;O  2  /CO  2  battery achieves a full discharge capacity of 6,628 mAh g  &#8208;1  and a long life of 715 cycles, which is even better than those of pure Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. We believe the findings here present an important step towards Li&#8208;air batteries from Li&#8208;O  2  batteries as well as other metal&#8208;air systems.</dc:description>

      <title>TEAD&#8208;YAP interaction inhibitors and MDM2 binders from DNA&#8208;encoded indole&#8208;focused Ugi&#8208;peptidomimetics</title>
      <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial synthesis provides efficient and dense coverage of chemical space around privileged molecular structures. The indole side chain of tryptophan plays a prominent role in key, or &#8220;hot spot&#8221; regions of protein&#8208;protein interactions. A DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial peptoid library was designed based on the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction employing tryptophan&#8208;mimetic indole side chains to probe target protein surface. Several peptoids were synthesized on a chemically stable hexathymidine adapter oligonucleotide &#8220;hexT&#8221;, encoded by DNA sequences and substituted by azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition to yield a library of 8,112 molecules. Selection experiments on the tumor&#8208;relevant proteins MDM2 and TEAD4 yielded MDM2 binders and a novel class of TEAD&#8208;YAP interaction inhibitors that perturbed expression of a gene under the control of these Hippo pathway effectors.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial synthesis provides efficient and dense coverage of chemical space around privileged molecular structures. The indole side chain of tryptophan plays a prominent role in key, or &#8220;hot spot&#8221; regions of protein&#8208;protein interactions. A DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial peptoid library was designed based on the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction employing tryptophan&#8208;mimetic indole side chains to probe target protein surface. Several peptoids were synthesized on a chemically stable hexathymidine adapter oligonucleotide &#8220;hexT&#8221;, encoded by DNA sequences and substituted by azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition to yield a library of 8,112 molecules. Selection experiments on the tumor&#8208;relevant proteins MDM2 and TEAD4 yielded MDM2 binders and a novel class of TEAD&#8208;YAP interaction inhibitors that perturbed expression of a gene under the control of these Hippo pathway effectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Acceptor&#8208;doping accelerated charge separation in Cu2O photocathode for photoelectrochemical water splitting: a theoretical and experimental study</title>
      <dc:description>Cu  2  O is a typical photoelectrocatalyst for sustainable hydrogen production, while the fast charge recombination hinders its further development. Herein, Ni  2+  cations have been doped into Cu  2  O lattice (named as Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O) via a simple hydrothermal method and act as electron traps. Theoretical results predict that the Ni dopants produce an acceptor impurity level and lower the energy barrier of hydrogen evolution. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements demonstrate that Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O exhibits a photocurrent density of 0.83 mA cm  &#8722;2  , which is 1.34 times higher than that of Cu  2  O. And the photostability has been enhanced by 7.81 times. Moreover, characterizations confirm the enhanced light&#8208;harvesting, facilitated charge separation and transfer, prolonged charge lifetime, and increased carrier concentration of Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O. This work provides a deep insight into how the acceptor&#8208;doping modifies the electronic structure and optimize the PEC process.</dc:description>

      <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Rhombohedral DNA Crystal Scaffold with Tunable Cavity Sizes and High Resolution Structural Detail</title>
      <dc:description>Rationally designing DNA crystal lattices to scaffold molecular species and solve their structure with X&#8208;ray crystallography is the foundational goal of structural DNA nanotechnology. DNA is an ideal molecule for the construction of 3D crystals with tunable properties due to its high programmability based on canonical Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing, with crystal assembly in all three dimensions facilitated by immobile Holliday junctions and sticky end cohesion. Despite the promise of these systems, only a handful of unique crystal scaffolds have been reported. In this work, we describe a new crystal system with a repeating sequence that mediates the assembly of a 3D scaffold via a series of Holliday junctions linked together with complementary sticky ends. By using an optimized junction sequence, we were able to determine a high resolution (2.7 &#197;) structure containing R3 crystal symmetry, with a slight subsequent improvement (2.6 &#197;) using a modified sticky&#8208;end sequence. The structure is distinct due to a unique immobile Holliday junction sequence, which in turn allowed us to produce crystals that provided a structure with unprecedented atomic detail. Furthermore, we expanded the crystal cavities by 50% by adding an additional helical turn between junctions, and we solved the structure of the resulting lattices to 4.5 &#197; resolution by molecular replacement. These crystals will potentially enable the discrete placement of guest molecules&#8212;such as small molecule catalysts, nanoparticles, or peptides/proteins&#8212;amenable to the cavity size within the scaffold with atomic precision.</dc:description>

      <title>Necroptosis Induced by Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Dual Catalytic Inhibitors of Topoisomerase I/II</title>
      <dc:description>Inducing necroptosis in cancer cells is an effective approach to circumvent drug&#8208;resistance. Metal&#8208;based triggers have, however, rarely been reported. Ruthenium(II) complexes containing 1,1&#8208;(pyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyreno[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazine were developed with a series of different ancillary ligands (  Ru1  &#8208;  7  ). The combination of the main ligand with bipyridyl and phenylpyridyl ligands endows  Ru7  with superior nucleus&#8208;targeting properties. As a rare dual catalytic inhibitor,  Ru7  effectively inhibits the endogenous activities of topoisomerase (topo) I and II and kills cancer cells by necroptosis. The cell signaling pathway from topo inhibition to necroptosis was elucidated. Furthermore,  Ru7  displays significant antitumor activity against drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells  in vivo  . To the best of our knowledge,  Ru7  is the first Ru&#8208;based necroptosis&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic agent.</dc:description>

This is the highest FE for C2+ alcohol with commercial current density to date. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NGQ/Cu&#8208;nr could provide dual catalytic active sites, and could stabilize the CH2CHO intermediate to enhance the FE of alcohols significantly through further carbon protonation.

      <title>3D hydroxylated MXene/carbon nanotubes composite as scaffold for dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal electrode</title>
      <dc:description>Sodium metal is a promising anode, but the uneven Na deposition with a dendrite growth seriously impedes its application. Herein, a fibrous hydroxylated MXene/carbon nanotubes (h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs) composite is designed as a scaffold for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal electrode. This composite displays fast Na  +  /electron transport kinetics, satisfied thermal conductivity and mechanical property. The h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  contains abundant sodiophilic functional groups, which play a significant role in inducing homogeneous nucleation of Na. Meanwhile, CNTs provide high tensile strength and ease film&#8208;forming. As a result, h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs exhibit a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and no dendrite after 1000 cycles. The h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs/Na based symmetric cells show a long lifespan over 4000 h at 1.0 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  with a capacity of 1.0 mAh&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Furthermore, Na&#8208;O  2  batteries with h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs/Na anode exhibit a low potential gap of 0.11 V after an initial 70 cycles. This work paves the way to construct stable Na anode by hydroxylated MXene materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Flapping Peryleneimide as a Fluorogenic Dye with High Photostability and Strong Visible&#8208;Light Absorption</title>
      <dc:description>Flapping fluorophores (FLAP) with a flexible 8&#960; ring are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile photofunctional system. Here we report a highly photostable &#8220;flapping peryleneimide&#8221; with an unprecedented fluorogenic mechanism based on a bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar conformational change in the S  1  excited state. The S  1  planarization induces an electronic configurational switch, almost quenching an inherent fluorescence (FL) of peryleneimide moieties. However, the FL quantum yield is remarkably improved with a prolonged lifetime by a slight environmental change. This fluorogenic function is realized by sensitive &#960;&#8208;conjugation design, as a more &#960;&#8208;expanded analogue does not show the planarization dynamics. With strong visible&#8208;light absorption, the FL lifetime response synchronized with the flexible flapping motion is useful for the latest optical techniques such as FL lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</dc:description>

Hence, we have measured HKUST&#8208;1 during the adsorption of CO and NO.

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;II: Outlook</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploring the possibilities: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring the possibilities &lt;/b&gt;: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facile Preparation of WO3&#8208;x Dots with Remarkably Low Toxicity and Uncompromised Activity as Coreactants for Clinic Electrochemiluminescent Diagnosis</title>
      <dc:description>The exceptional nature of WO3&#8208;x  dots has inspired widespread interests, but it is still a significant challenge to synthesize high&#8208;quality WO3&#8208;x  dots without using unstable reactants, expensive equipment, and complex synthetic processes. Herein, we report the synthesis of ligand&#8208;free WO3&#8208;x  dots that were highly dispersible and rich in oxygen&#8208;vacancies by a simple but straightforward exfoliation of bulk WS2  and a mild follow&#8208;up chemical conversion. Surprisingly, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were emerged as coreactants for the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of Ru(bpy)32+  with a comparable ECL efficiency to the well&#8208;known Ru(bpy)32+  /tripropylamine (TPrA) system. Moreover, compared to TPrA, whose toxicity remains a critical issue of concern, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were ~300&#8208;fold lower toxic. The potent of WO3&#8208;x  dots was further explored in a showcase for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with the most competitive limit of detection so far. This work would not only open a new way to synthesize WO3&#8208;x  dots with superior properties but also stimulate an emerging application in clinic ECL diagnosis as coreactants with uncompromised high performance and unprecedented low toxicity.</dc:description>

      <title>Designable Aluminum Molecular Rings: Ring Expansion and Ligand Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Presented here are the Al(III) molecular ring architectures from 8&#8208;ring to 16&#8208;ring. Although there are numerous reported cyclic coordination compounds based on transition metals, gallium, or lanthanides, so far the Al molecular are less developed due to the fast hydrolysis nature of Al 3+  ion. In this work, with the assistant of different monohydric alcohol, a series of atomic precisely aluminum molecular rings based on benzoates have been successfully synthesized. The ring expansion of these Al&#8208;rings from 8&#8208;ring to 16&#8208;ring is related to the structure&#8208;directing agents of monohydric alcohols. Moreover, the organic ligands on the Al&#8208;ring can be properly modified by using various benzoate derivatives, which lead to tunable surface properties of these Al&#8208;rings from hydrophilicity to ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity. Importantly, 4&#8208;aminobenzoic acid bridged 16&#8208;ring is soluble in organic solvents and exhibits high solution stability revealed by mass spectroscopy. Ligand substitution also can be performed between these Al&#8208;rings, which reveal controllable ligand functionalization of these Al&#8208;rings. This family of Al&#8208;rings with the ability to be post&#8208;modified therefore can be considered and expected as interesting and potential lego&#8208;like nano&#8208;building units for reticular chemistry. Such a model of organic shell modification without alteration of the inorganic core structure opens a new platform to further tune the chemical&#8208;property and subsequent utilization of these promising Al&#8208;rings. This work not only reveals molecular ring architectures assembled from Al 3+  ions and benzoates but also provides coordination delayed hydrolysis strategy toward the synthesis of crystalline Al(III)&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Superresolution Imaging using Charge Transfer Dynamics in Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
      <dc:description>In a conjugated polymer based single&#8208;particle heterojunction, stochastic fluctuations of the photogenerated hole population lead to spontaneous fluorescence switching. We found that 405 nm irradiation can induce charge recombination and activate the single&#8208;particle emission. Based on these phenomena, we developed a novel class of semiconducting polymer dots that can operate in two superresolution imaging modes. The spontaneous switching mode offers efficient imaging of large areas, with &lt;10 nm localization precision, while the photoactivation/deactivation mode offers slower imaging, with further improved localization precision (~1 nm), showing advantages in resolving small structures that require high spatial resolution. Superresolution imaging of microtubules and clathrin&#8208;coated pits was demonstrated, under both modes. The excellent localization precision and versatile imaging options provided by these nanoparticles offer clear advantages for imaging of various biological systems.</dc:description>

Molecular&#8208;level models for these effects have reaching consequences in stereoselective ion&#8208;pair catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Surface Capping Agents and Their Roles in Shape&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A pivotal role in directing the growth of colloidal metal nanocrystals into diverse but well&#8208;controlled shapes is played by surface capping agents. This article offers a comprehensive review of capping agents as well as their use in engineering the surface structures and catalytic properties of metal nanocrystals.







Abstract
Surface capping agents have been extensively used to control the evolution of seeds into nanocrystals with diverse but well&#8208;controlled shapes. Here we offer a comprehensive review of these agents, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of their roles in guiding the shape evolution of metal nanocrystals. We begin with a brief introduction to the early history of capping agents in electroplating and bulk crystal growth, followed by discussion of how they affect the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in a synthesis of metal nanocrystals. We then present representative examples to highlight the various capping agents, including their binding selectivity, molecular&#8208;level interaction with a metal surface, and impacts on the growth of metal nanocrystals. We also showcase progress in leveraging capping agents to generate nanocrystals with complex structures and/or enhance their catalytic properties. Finally, we discuss various strategies for the exchange or removal of capping agents, together with perspectives on future directions.
